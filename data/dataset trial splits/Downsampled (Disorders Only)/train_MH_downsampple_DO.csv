34115,paranoid about testicles and now I'm freaking out So I'm totally serious here and I know it sounds like I'm trying to be funny but I'm not! A week ago I was lazy and didn't do laundry so I went commando for pretty much a week. Because of how loose it was down there I became more aware of my testicles and would reach down there more often. Anyways because I was constantly reaching down there I became paranoid about my testicles. I should also note that I was a frequent fapper like 34 times a day and decided to stop that. So I would go nofap for 2 days and then have a go at it once the next day. Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it. I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little pinch on my left testicle. It didn't hurt or anything it was just... uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia!!I haven't felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again. I always constantly reach down there feeling them and thinking omg one is bigger than the other! omg one feels softer than the other! I'm dying!I want to go to the doctor but I also have a fear of doctors! I can't sleep. I'm undereating. I sometimes cry at night. I was never like this and I hate it. Last year I was paranoid about my neck which took me a while to get over and now it's below the belt. I just want to live my life normally again. ,Anxiety

34097,Constantly checking for signs of brain problem Hey guys. So this is a little difficult to explain so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think there is something wrong with my brain. Well now its manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I dodont have a problem Ive begun subconsciously checking every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance Ill skim a headline really fast online then get frustrated when I misread it even though I didnt carefully read it. Because Im now checking every single word I read and hear Im constantly misreading mishearing and misunderstanding things because Im focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. Its mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory which of course is fueling my health anxiety as it further proves I have something wrong with me. Of course occupying my mind with this causes me to make many many mistakes which you guessed it fuels it more. Has anyone else struggled with health anxiety pertaining to a brain problem? This really sucks. ,Anxiety

34075,Chest Pain Hello I have been experiencing this random chest pain on the left and it has been very concerning for me. It started back in June 2017 random pain that comes and goes and only last for like a few seconds or so. It happens sometimes near center of my chest to the left or upper left near shoulder. It also disappeared and stopped after a few months then came back again in October and disappeared again and came back again. I've been to the doctor and he said my heart beat was fine blood pressure was fine blood test turned out normal mostly just need a bit of exercise to lower fat. Doctor said it probably is muscle spasms but does it happen this often? It's getting really annoying and causes me to freak out sometimes.,Anxiety

34058,My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello rHealthAnxiety!Allow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!The first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder which I thought was a tumor. Of course it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into fullblown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister's house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs embedded itself in the bowels of my sister's house and bit me on the ankle. Of course this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.My health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet again I did not die but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into fulltime paranoia that I would not escape until October.Except for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective but from a mental perspective if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication I was in rough shape. In midJuly I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now before you go into a google symptom allow me to explain what happened my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn't know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn't until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a followup with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1x2x3 sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weirdass belly button.In the meantime I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa which is now down which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.To err on the side of caution my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of and the only weird thing was my beta globulins ever so slightly out of range think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem. Wanting to be as thorough as possible the pathologist recommended a BenceJones Test for leukemias myelomas and preleukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness I stewed over it.And then something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don't want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric checkups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal only at appointments.My status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find wasElevated liver enzymes likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of testsMaybe some gallbladder sludgestoneWeirdass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on itAnd guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll take therapy different meds getting sick of tests or all three but you can get there. Don't give up.,Anxiety

34085,Health anxiety vent My massive fear is getting pregnant. Every twinge I have no matter what is pregnancy. This all started from an increase in anxiety levels after ironically staring the birth control pill.Its been going on for months. No amount of doctors visits home tests visits to a sexual health nurse not even having penetrative sex or even a blood test has managed to completely calm me down. If it does it only lasts for a few hours. All I think is of women I read about on the internet who have been 8 months pregnant without any tests and still getting periods or if Im ectopic my Mum nearly died from one of those.Ive had nexplanon put in my arm but the stories online of women getting pregnant somehow overrule the data that says its 99.9 effectivemy nurse saying she wouldnt even do a test on me if I came in with nexplanon claiming to be pregnant. Ive just started CBT and Im on antidepressants citalopram which I dont think is working after 5 weeks on 10mg. Im just terrified that Ill never get better and Ill have to leave my university and my boyfriend and friends in London and move home to my parents again who I adore but I never wanted to stay at home for uni. That would be a massive defeat for me.Just needed to vent because Im fkin terrified right now and all I can thing about is the pain Im getting in my stomach and if its a baby kicking me.,Anxiety
34069,Need Support ASAP for rabies fear!! So on January 4th almost 2 weeks ago I pet and gently moved a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. He let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back but darted off a little peturbed once I moved him. He may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever I feel I would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers.I went about my night my birthday night without much else of a thought for the cat. The next morning I did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cutscraped area on my elbow that I'm still not sure how it came to be. But again I patched it up and went about my days. Its since healed fine. I wasn't intoxicated but I had been out dancing late and thought maybe I bumped it at some point.Fast forward to today January 17th and the talk of rabies comes up. Suddenly I remember the cat and mysterious scratch. Surely I would've known if the cat did It? He was friendly docile and clean. I figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. But now I'm freaked out! Should I talk to my Dr about getting a rabies shot now?! Its been 2 weeks on Saturday.I fully intend to call my Dr in the morning and have spoken to the nurse hotline. I just know they also kind of have to give me the just in case response and would like some more candid input.,Anxiety

Im part Irish and used to lay in the sun when I was a teen a lot. Ive been checked in the past year and a half and my dermatologist always acts like Im crazy for coming in. She said its normal to keep getting new moles and even told me this really ugly one in my belly button is fine. Im currently living in France and I have a doctors appointment on Wednesday but I keep convincing myself I have it and Im going to die. I cant sleep or focus on anything and Im constantly taking pictures of the my body to exam the moles and always convince myself theyre all cancer.

However I just recently did a dumb thing and looked up symptoms of celiac disease and am rationalizing going to the doctor and getting tested.No one else in my family even extended has had lactose or acid problems. Eating gluten with celiacs long term can cause those problems. I've always been underweight 5'11 130 lbs. Im also always tired though I think my iron levels are fine and I cleared a thyroid test a few years ago. When I have more than 3 drinks in a night I have severe vomiting the next day to the point I've gone to the ER because it had been every hour for 8ish hours.For someone this anxious about it you'd think I'd track these things better. But now I'm locked into a very shitty vegetarian diet at work chockfull of products with gluten for the next 5 months. Would I be justified in going to the doctor just to lay all this out there and see if its related maybe to celiac? Or am I just being paranoid?,Anxiety

34196,I need a little help. My first post and for some reason the first time opening up about my own internal struggle. Hey guys Ive been struggling with anxiety for the better part of 7 years. Ive always been able to keep it under control but after having a near death experience in my teens my anxious nature has been directed towards my health. For the past 9 months Ive been experience various symptoms consisting of brain fog muscle twitches all over my body. sharp nerve pain that seems to come and go affecting everything from my legs to my wrist and fingers. muscle buzzing primarily in the feet feels like a cell phone going off under my foot. This worry of ether a neurological disease or a serious infection such as Lyme seems to dominate most of my days. I constantly make the mistake of self diagnosing using discussion posts of users on various sites with similar issues and I realize its a recipe for unhappiness. This type of worry feels at times like an addiction that I simply cannot stop coming back to.I live an incredibly charmed life with an amazing family and incredible fianc. And I realize Im not hard done by in the traditional sense. But this anxiety surrounding my health is something Im desperate to manage but more importantly be done with. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated and THANK YOU so much for taking the time out of your day to read this. ,Anxiety

34219,How do you stop fuzzing? My friend is as healthy as can be but eversince I started really knowing him there's been something wrong. He'd go to the doctor clear up whatever condition he thought he had and then he'll go home and start googling every single aspect of his bodily functions. For example Smelling burning wood then he thinks obviously something is wrong with his nose now?? Until eventually he discovers some other condition he may have. Then he stresses it until a doctor clears it up again and then repeat. He would sit for hours up at night reading symptoms and unfortunately that is not exaggeration.He's never fine never normal never healthy in his mind. And as much as it annoys me its worrisome. Because there's no helping a person that always thinks that he knows better.I'm looking for someone who can advise him on how you coped or even escaped this state of mind.

Its not always as bad as it has been for the past few days but its already annoying me so much. Its like I cant relax my mind and the biggest issue for me is watching my current TV show. I know it sounds dumb but its what i love doing the most and what makes it easier to get through the day. Its like these annoying thoughts keep getting in the way and I cant enjoy watching my stuff. For instance Im up next to solve an exercise in math class on tuesday in front of the class and its not for a grade or anything but my brain keeps telling me that I wont be able to relax until i complete that and I wish my turn was on friday so i could enjoy the weekend.

34000,HA for two weeks just discovered what its like Hi allSo the last two weeks have been a ride for me. I've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear runs in the family. A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. So I started taking antibios ... didnt go away. So today I went to an ENT who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time 1 week 1 hour 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal. I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. The ringing will go away just in time.The problem is... throughout the past several days I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness. The first concern was cancer then that turned into a meningiti then that turned into inner ear concerns then that turned into HIV concerns ...I don't know how I arrived at any of these conclusions. I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses yet I immediately assumed that I had them. No way do I have meningitis I would know by now ... no way do I have cancer it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms. No way do I have aids ... I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. I literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps rashes bruises .... I write because I'm curious to know other people's stories. How do you cope with this? This constant anxietydriven fear of having a major disease. I've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses conditions symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past. The slightest itch would terrify me. An ingrown hair on my beltline convinced me I had an STD. In effect I didn't actually live the past week. My worrying sapped away from my actual living. Sorry for the long drawn out rant. ,Anxiety
33991,the HA just won't quit... So long time lurker and first time poster. Just have to say how helpful this subreddit is for calming me down during a heath anxiety meltdown!Background My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer about 7 years ago went into remission was rediagnosed with stage four bc a year and a half ago and passed away about six months ago it had spread to her brain. I'm 23 female and she did not carry any of the BRCA genes.Around 5 years ago I felt a small bump in my armpit while doing a selfexam and went into a full blown panic. After about a month of constantly poking and prodding and googling symptoms I forgot about it and the next time I checked it had disappeared. I noticed it again a year later and had a physical around that time and asked my doctor. She said that it was fine and nothing to worry about can't remember if she said lymph node or cyst...I was just so excited I was not dyingFast forward to six months ago when my mother passed away and I became hyperaware of anything breastrelated. The small lump is currently present. It's come and gone a number of times since I first noticed it years ago it's always in the exact same spot lasts for various amounts of time it's 'biggest' size has never changed and when it's 'gone' I can kind of feel a little remnant. It's under the skin not hard but not exactly soft either can move around but tends to move with the skin it's directly under. Sometimes when I get poking at it for days on end it hurts a little bit and the skin gets irritated. My aunt has suffered from cysts most of her life and has gotten a lot in her armpits and my stepmother who is a nurse has told me that I'm fine.Basically I know it's not cancer most of the signs point to the fact it's not but Google of course tells me that I'm dying of a million different cancers mostly lymphoma or metastatic breast cancer. I have an annual exam in around a month and I'm going to ask about it for the peace of mind but I just can't stop worrying about it. Any tips? It's just so frustrating to know I'm being completely ridiculous but it's like I have no control over it.,Anxiety

33985,I feel really silly posting this but... I think Ill feel better if I get this off my chest. I definitely have some health anxiety although its not as bad as it could be. I recognize that many of the symptoms I feel from time to time are a result of internalizing stress and are made worse by worrying about them and I think Ive gotten a better handle on it as the years have gone by.But I dont think anxiety can cause lumps or make them grow and Im trying to stay away from Google and redirect my focus but Im still feeling that worry and wanting to check on the lump every five minutes. I think Ive done a fairly good job keeping myself in check and only examining the lump once a day. But Im going to write this out and see if it helps. Maybe someone else has had a similar story and everything turned out fine? I want to hear it if so.Close to a year ago now I noticed this lump under my arm. I thought it was an ingrown hair. Mentioned it at a checkup the doctor felt it and thought it was a lymph node. She offered to do an ultrasound but I was getting ready to move out of state and didnt have time. The lump grew and became really painful and red. For reasons I didnt see a doctor until about eight months later when they diagnosed the lump as an abscess next to a swollen lymph node. Abscess was drained tested positive for Staph I got a gross course of antibiotics and that was that. The lymph node shrank a little after that and I could still feel a lump where the abscess was. Primary care doctor said it was a cyst that had formed form the abscess being left alone for so long and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed. The surgeon was not very nice told me he couldnt feel anything and sent me home. Eventually the cyst shrank and I couldnt feel it anymore. Fast forward to two months later and now...the original lymph node has shrunk but its still around. And now above it theres a new...mass. Its next to where the abscess was before but off to the outside top corner of my armpit sorry for the bad explanation. Its a hard lump and fixed in place which freaks me out a bit because google says thats a sign of cancer. Buuuuuut maybe its just my muscle Im feeling. The other armpit has a bit of that bump thing going on at the top but its way less pronounced and feels less like a defined lump if that makes sense. And it feels like its growing. Thanks to the abscess I have a scar and it feels like the lump is noticeably getting closer to the scar. I feel like such a drama queen. Im so embarrassed bringing stuff like this up at the doctor because Im so used to being dismissed and them thinking Im a huge baby. I just feel ashamed of being like this. Being stuck between worry or embarrassment isnt much of a choice. But this nagging voice in my head keeps saying anxiety cant cause a lump like it could cause a headache or nausea or heartburn or whatever. I just cant cope with the humiliation if it turns out being nothing and they think Im an idiot. I have an appointment with my doctor for something unrelated and not to do with something being wrong with me and Im debating on if I should bring it up. My doctor now seems really good and nonjudgy these feelings are internalized. If someone else has had a mysterious bump that vanished one day and ended up being nothing please let me know. Thanks ,Anxiety

34042,Pupil size Im a 30 year old female and just noticed a difference in pupil size. Its only in dim light and Ive been to the optometrist 2 times everything looks fine and I have 2020 vision she said it was so small she didnt notice it until I mentioned it. But obviously still have been anxious and checking in the mirror nonstop. I got a horrible stiff neck back in June and have had a kink in my neck since Im also a long distance walker 10miles 4X a week and have been told this can be because of hip stuff. I have had blood work and everything is fine. But Im convinced I have a spinal or brain tumor its been hard for me to concentrate on information probably because Im preoccupied with anxiety and Im dizzy but I cant tell if Im making that up too. Feeling crummy and pretty shameful. ,Anxiety

34014,Paranoid about a healing bump on the forehead So almost two weeks ago last Monday I decided to go to Urgent Care because of chest pains. On my way to the car I opened the door and it whacked me in the forehead.I had a huge egg on my forehead above my right eye and it has almost gone down completely. The only bump is a small vertical line raised that isn't much longer than 34. But because it is a line and it hurts to touch it as well as after touching it my brain is telling me I'm going to die of a blood clot or a stroke. Can someone please help convince me this isn't the case? Dumb brain trying to scare me.,Anxiety

So latest health crisis was a fear that i had a kidney infection. my only symptom started last Wednesday with severe lower back pain and my whole back started to feel tense because well i don't know why. Its like i was being very careful not to strain the parts that hurt and as a result tensed up everything else. lower back was even spasming and i thought for sure kidney. after that thought won i started getting chills and teeth chattered this happens when i am terrified during panic attacks too. so last thursday headed straight to my dr. they did not find an infection but saw a little bit of WBC in my urine so they loaded me with antibiotics muscle relaxers and a shot of toradol. and prednisone for inflammation. NO fever nothing just intense anxiety and lower back pain. I lift weights and mostly do glute work and increased weights last week plus i wear super high heels. anyway the pain has lessened but 1 i didn't take the prednisone but today i felt my back tight and painful again so I took HALF a muscle relaxer bc i don't like the out of control drowsiness that it causes. This is the first time ive ever taken one. but i looked up side effects. anyway i took the half at 2 and i feel so sleepy but like scared to sleep. my anxiety has been at a 7 every since i took it. I don't know why? maybe the lack of control or the fear that ill have a bad reaction??,Anxiety

For instance sometime when I focus on my breathing so much my arm begins to really hurt.

34076,Just looking for some advice. First a little backstory sorry if a bit long. Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough I us an ecigarette as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulderblade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.My doctor said everything felt normal my blood pressure was normal as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an xray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out tight chest sweating vomiting trouble sleeping just overall freaking out about what that xray might show. Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest trouble sleeping with bad thoughts and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. I also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate between 59 when I sleep and 120ish when i'm up working. Sorry for the wall of text I am just hoping someone here could give me some tips on managing this stress. I have a yearly physical next month that can't get here soon enough.Thank you.,Anxiety
685,thanks! I'm really worried and I can't stand myself until I feel really weird physically. Usually I always take medicine from my doctor but I usually when I'm worried about taking the medicine I feel even more anxious and in the morning my whole body hurts. I should how? cont.,Anxiety

I am going to be requesting a blood test on Monday due to some GI problems I have had since November which started when I started taking a daily multivitamin although have not been serious enough to warrant consulting a medical professional but not mild enough to be ignored completely. I am absolutely terrified they are going to turn around and say that I have a serious form of cancer or IBD there has not been any bleeding fatigue or fever though. I know it's an irrational fear because I frequently exercise 75 of my diet is healthy and I don't smoke drink or do drugs.

33983,Uneven pupils on Friday I was looking in the mirror and noticed that my left pupil is much larger than my right. The vision in that eye is also blurry. I visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right but he didn't know why. He assumed that its something I've always had but only noticed now but that's impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke hello health anxiety. a few days before the uneven pupils I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear usually pulsatile rushing noise. I'm afraid its either a carotid dissectionstroke or some sort of tumor. Maybe I had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue? Anyway I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had weird eye issues or fears. Its tough to have all these thoughts in my head without anyone listening or taking them seriously. ,Anxiety
34202,Psychiatrist wants me to get a blood test She says it could show the levels of medication in my blood and if it's effective etc. And if I have a thyroid disorder or diabetes or vitamin deficiency or some other physical reason for my depression and anxiety. Yeah it makes perfect sense to get the blood test.But I swear to God I just don't think I can do it. I am so sure something serious will be wrong with me and I just don't think I can handle it. Last time I had a blood test I fainted when I heard the results which weren't actually bad in any way. Just thinking about it has had me depressed and anxious and crying for days now. I'm not afraid of needles but I can't imagine going to the doctor for the blood test let alone waiting for days for the results. I just don't think I can do it. I don't want to do it even though I know it's objectively a good idea.I'm seriously considering just... not seeing this psychiatrist anymore. I guess I could eventually find one who doesn't demand blood tests.I don't know what I'm asking for here. Advice if you have it but if not can anyone relate?,Anxiety

33899,I've been crying all day sure my time is up About 3 years ago a good friend of mine passed away from acute leukemia at the age of 19. I was devastated and with a lifelong battle with health anxiety it always lingered in my mind anytime I would get ill. Would this be the time I faced the same fate?Well now this time I'm more or less certain that the time has come. I came down with some infection from a coworker back on November 18th. At first is was merely a slight sore throat some coughing malaise. I began to feel better around the end of November. Then the first week of December the sore throat came back. And fever severe congestion cough fatigue achy muscles amongst other things. I began to feel better from that but have not been the same since. As of right now I have a terrible cough irritated throat congestion. I have been having night sweats where my neck and head get very damp but I am not drenched and it only affects the head and neck. I am simply not myself. The positives that have kept me hopeful I do not have acute leukemia I have been able to make it to the gym to lift about 34 times a week. I don't have much motivation to do so but I make it and my strength is still there. I have not lost any weight gained a few pounds actually currently at 6'0 and 220 poundswhen I do feel bad I'm never running a fever my temp is usually somewhere between 96.9 and 98.5I'm not bruising at all even after bumping into things and I don't have any petechia anywhere to suggest low platelets my infections haven't been severe per se. I haven't had sore throats like that of strep and no mouth sores or bleeding gums they've just been persistent I've been going out on the weekends with friends for a few drinks which ironically when I am not sober I do not experience night sweats at all the guy who originally got me sick is still sick himself and my entire family is sick back and forthBut nonetheless I can't help but think this is it for me. I just keep looking at pictures of my mom or baby sister or handmade birthday cards from my sister just little sentimental things and I start crying like a baby. I don't want to leave them I don't want my family and friends to go through what my friend's loved ones went through three years ago when they lost her I love life so much and I don't want it to end. It's all I can think about though. I don't really know where to go from here. Nobody in my family thinks it's odd I've been sick for the better part of 6 weeks and I put on a front to everyone that I'm fine to not alarm them but on the inside I'm falling apart.,Anxiety

I first thought it was something in the coffee maker but I then drank some water and it had the same soapy after taste. I had a friend taste the water and they said they didn't taste any soapiness. It became obvious it was just me. It's possible I got some shampoo in my mouth when I shower shortly before drinking the coffee but I don't remember that happening. I decided to Google soapy taste in mouth and it said it's a possible symptom of sodium fluoride poisoning. My hypochondriac side started getting worried. I drink a lot of unfiltered tap water but I don't know if that's enough to get sodium fluoride poisoning.I just got over a cold so I don't know if that has anything to do it. This seems like a silly thing to be worried about but Google gets me paranoid as usual.Am I good?,Anxiety

34223,Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. Warning this post got much MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.So I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline for chronic depressionptsd and trazodone for sleep but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 11 12 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it. I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.I have had ekgs countless times probably like over 10 times ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years and for the most part were completely 100 normal shocker.... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling shaking in my chest with every beat like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure which wouldn't be that unrealistic as purging electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. sleep deprivation I had stayed up all night physical activity while literally running on empty we were inside playing basketball when it all started and of course hypoglycemia essentially noteating will do that to ya all lower the seizure threshold and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 for the record throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it it has always always sat at a comfy 5560 while not using HRraising drugs such as dxm or speed when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. Coming fairly close to death which has actually happened to me a numerous times with my purging phase over exercising phase I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 35 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad real bad restriction phase I have eaten less than 500 calories day for months at a time several times in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on as I am pushing myself to not eat God I hate being eating disordered but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months can't rmmbr cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions or if it just was a crash dietturned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 12 years ago legit almost got tboned we would have been hit on myher side of the car had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection that person would have hit us. oddly enough she was panicking yet I f elt absolutely nothing no adrenaline no fear nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool notI wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't I am a person who is very much into record keeping. I feel like I am not actually alive that I died months years ago and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be am not actually alive because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father isn't a piece of shit drug addict doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. how did my life end up like this....... I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are Holy fucking shit. Oops sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could sense that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad but that coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out if I mayhaps did permanent structural unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode and am now much much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. Now what's weird about this phobia is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty notgood for you yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 420 times a day no fucking joke and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is normal about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig the highest it goes is like 13085 which insanely and funnily enough is still probably lower than like 70 of Americas blood pressure lmao which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally with only the Cigs and no meth like 9060 sometimes even like 8557 no lie. I attribute it to my whole foodplant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues. I would be shocked if anyone actually reads this entire essay,Anxiety
34164,Is this health anxiety? Hi.To start off for the past few months i've been fucking worrying about my mouth. All started with a load of canker sores in my mouth.I recently quit using chewing tobacco and i have a feeling it stems from that.I always worry about my mouth for example..I check my mouth to make sure everything is okay....Everything going goOHGODWHATTHEFUCKISTHAT??Insert hours of worrying and pacingAnother example i was out in the garage and had an urge to check a mirror quick noticed something on the roof of my mouth.insert the hugest adrenaline rush ever once i noticed it.I thought that was the end for me i instantly messaged my mother at like 2 in the morning fucking shaking.Why is this happening?

I have this feeling there is something wrong with my mouth but whenever i post pictures of the problem on dentistry i realized how stupid it was.Help?,Anxiety
34018,Irrationally terrified of seizures I have spent today being irrationally terrified of having a seizure. I've never had a seizure before. I've seen my sister having a diabetic seizure but that's as close as I've gotten to experiencing one.My anxiety stems from the fact that people with retinal migraine are at a higher risk of experiencing seizures and strokes.Then there is this I was prescribed Wellbutrin last week to help with getting out of bed in the mornings coupled with venlaflaxine. My psych informed me that drinking alcohol can result in a seizure while on Wellbutrin. In addition so can combining Wellbutrin and aspirinAdvil. He said Tylenol is OK and I checked online for any drug interactions too which confirmed that it should be OK. I have a cold today and an upset stomach so I took some Tylenol Cold amp Flu pills to relieve it.And then I spent the rest of my evening preoccupied by the idea of having a seizure because I took Tylenol. I even contemplated seriously telling my boss that I could have a seizure along with wanting to tell my coworker that if I am on the ground shaking uncontrollably that it is a seizure and to call an ambulance.Completely irrational I know. Some days are just worse than others I suppose.,Anxiety

34174,Health Anxiety and Xanax My health anxiety involves fear of having a heart attack or stroke. Ive been to the Emergency Rooms more times that I can count thinking im dying. I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me Zoloft daily and Xanax .5 mg to take only in emergencies. Ive been taking the Zoloft for the past week and a half noticing no improvement but ive heard it takes a while for it to actually kick in. I still haven't taken any of the Xanax and it makes me anxious to think about the side effects and hearing stories of people getting addicted to itdying from it. Anyone have any good experiences with it? I would hate for it to make my panic attacks worse. Ive been thinking about taking 1 pill just to know what its going to feel like when im actually having an emergency.,Anxiety

34070,I'd been told it was just anxiety for two years and now I've been diagnosed with a tumor I developed Panic Disorder when I was in college shortly after the Virginia Tech Massacre. I was a freshman at Virginia Tech when it happened and my sophomore year I started to have deepseeded health anxiety fear of death mostly. I'd suffered through many family deaths before and psychologists had told me I had PTSD with fear of dying. I DO have health anxiety and I border on hypochondria. HOWEVER!When you already have a PD diagnosis or a hypochondria diagnosis I find that doctors don't take you seriously. I completely understand why they wouldn't it's tiresome for them when you come in and tell them you're having a heart attack when you're really suffering from GERD. When I first saw a doctor and told her that it felt like I'd broken my rib three times in one year she sent me to a psychiatrist. The next doctor told me I needed to up my Prozac. Finally a CT scan showed I have a severe Fibrous Dysplasia tumor in my 10th rib which is growing into my liver kidney and diaphragm. I'm scheduled for surgery on March 5th. It's hard to know when it's your health anxiety and when it's your health and GOOD LORD it's tiring for us anxious people to convince doctors that we're having a real problem. I honestly still don't know how to tell the difference but I'm here to say SOMETIMES your gut is right.Anyone else have trouble with doctors writing them off because of their Anxiety or Hypochondria?,Anxiety
33896,The worst things about hypochondria Hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me everyday Im crippled by it. I guess I just wanted to make a list of all the worst things I go through as a hypochondriac. Seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you youre not Changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time Changing your entire diet to become healthier for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because Im afraid of developing diabetes Checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally I have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot not even sure if its due to anxiety. Im scared its something serious Having very bad mental health days where you cant leave your house this happens to me a lot Not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious this drives me absolutely insane Not being able to lead a normal productive for me I cant hold a job because I always fear something bad will happen to me at work and Ill panic Being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies. For instance a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack Obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start Wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say youre okay Being in tons of debt from going to the ER because you think youre dying Always looking for reassurance from others obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you dont feel alone These are the only ones I can think of right now but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac Im curious about what others go through.,Anxiety

My parents got divorced my dad was alco my mom developed bi polar disorder right after the divorce. Iv been living in almost almost movie like circumstances my mom wasnt aggressive toward me for first 5 years but in last year of her hospitalization and stuff it was really a nightmare.My mom is doing real good now for past 56 years shes taking her meds regular she got back on her job so she is totally functional. But the thing is she is hypochondriac and one of things she got used to is that i always confront her or even more i make appointments drive her to doctor and so on. She got used to that cause i was cooking cleaning and doing regular home stuff in all those years before her recovery. But i cant handle it anymore i am diagnosed with mild severe anxiety with ocd and depression. I find it hard to find motivation for my own life i do alot of things i try to keep myself in focus on goals i have i am not happy how i am progressing but i am trying atleast. I just cant handle the doctors check ups anymore according to her she had cancer atleast 2 times in past 6 months. I am very reasonable person i understand why is she scared she had uterus cancer 20 yrs ago and she had it removed it was one of reasons she got depression. I really understand that i would do anything to change it but i cant . I was just having day full of work i had to study for my exam to finish this fucking law uni. She got into my room in 11 pm crying she smokes quiet alot and she said her throat is hurting her as the day progress shes affraid that its cancer again.

It was freezing last night so I went to the closet to grab an old comforter to add to my bed. What I had forgotten is that there is a mouse problem in this house. I woke up this morning and found a couple mouse droppings in my bed. I googled if that could be dangerous and panic ensued. I've googled the cases hantavirus reported in California and many of them focus around the area I'm in. There was also a case near Reno really close to here just last fall. There's mouse droppings littered in the carpet of this house one here one there and now I've slept with a blanket that had them in it. We're only here for 2 nights total so we didn't clean the place. I'm so scared for myself and my family. I hate being anxious like this because it feels like I KNOW i have it like I'm already in the hospital dying.

34207,Someone please help First of all I urge anyone who reads this to please give an opinion on what they think it may be I'm worried sick. Thanks in advance.Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.I'll get straight to it here are symptoms with context Odd feeling on left side of body mainly legs only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it really odd and it scares me. Tinnitus already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence. Constipation probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems. Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. A feeling that for some reason I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this the never being able to relax I feel on edge 247. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred or check my heartrate to check for palpitations or check my typing to check for strokeALS. I seriously can't keep living like this why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!Many thanks Max,Anxiety

33919,Dr.s office blew up my phone about results of blood test Ive been suffering from health anxiety for a few months now after a lymes disease scare in November. I found myself fine tuned to any achespains in my body at this time out of paranoia of getting lymes disease. After my blood test came back negative I still felt these aches and pains and now started to attribute them to severe diseases like cancer and driving myself crazy. These pains seem to be deep in my bone and very painful but I simply dont know if theyre psychosomatic or real. I find it hard to believe I could imagine these pains but at the same time I didnt feel these pains before my scare back in November. I finally went to get a physical for the first time in 4 years last week and also requested a blood test.Fast forward to today an unknown number called me 4 times and left a message the last time. It was the Dr.s office notifying me my blood results came in. I feel very uneasy about this... why not call once and leave a message? The multiple calls are freaking me out and makes me feel the results are really bad. Also does anyone know if my Lyme blood tests wouldve tested for cancer as well? Im 22 years old if this helps btw.

It is moderately painful doesn't feel like external pain like a scratch or impact of some sort and feels more like a shooting pain in the sense that it feels as though it is rushing up the first segment of my forefinger as it pains me.I am a little worried I have some sort of repetitive strain since I do spend a lot of time on the computer and playing on a Nintendo DS.

Last two years I've had skipped beats. Doctor told me it was probably pvc and did no test. I believed him and continued with my life. These skipped beats would happened when in rest so I wasn't worried. Last year I had a hernia surgery and I couldn't run for 4 month's. Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 12 times but sometimes 10 times. I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG echo stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99 all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear. ,Anxiety
34100,Heart fluttering So my doctor knows I have hypochondria and he's a bit old fashioned so he rarely goes out of his way to look for something that might be wrong with me. However I've been having among other things severe heart palpitations a couple times a minute most of the time and he simply dismissed it as probably nothing. Should I be worried? This happens even when I'm not anxious in the slightest and very regularly and I figure heart conditions should be looked into,Anxiety

34007,IBSpsoriasis My story and never would have thought what was causing it!! I want to share my story because I believe theres a lot people out there in my situation. When I was younger in high school I would get diarrhea going to class mostly happened in the morning. This was around the year 1999. I had psoriasis on my head for most of my life. It would get bad from time to time but never went away. The doctor would prescribe an ointment that stunk like gasoline. I would put this on head and it felt like it was burning the skin off my skull. So I never really used it just suffered as is. Now back to the diarrhea issue. I went to the doctors and they did everything you could imagine. Blood tests stool tests upper and lower GIs and the good old colonoscopy! In the end the doctor said that I was a healthy young man. So he diagnosed me with IBS.Once I graduated from high school it seem to simmer down to where I never really had any more symptoms. So I figured that is was over. Years passed by and once in a blue moon the IBS would come back. But the psoriasis never went away. I moved forward in my career and in my personal life. I thought that the nightmare I had when I was younger would never comeback. Boy I was wrong! One day at work after having something for lunch my captain and I had just taken off we were in the air for all of ten minutes. I looked at him and said we have to go back and land! He asked what was wrong I replied that Im going to crap my pants. So we turned the plane around and landed without incident. The next day my manager called and asked what had happened and I replied that I must have ate something I shouldnt have. Months rolled by with no farther problems other then the psoriasis. I upgraded to captain and loved what I was doing. Then one day it came back only this time it didnt go away!! Much worse I started taking Imodium gel caps one before the flight and as prescribed as many as I need during the flight.this was a bad idea for me but we will come back to thisSo off to the doctor I went and of course started to do familiar tests. Only this time after all the testing the doctor didnt just say it was IBS but it also must be in my head. Now its time to send me to a shrink. There I am off work by this point sitting on a couch playing head games at the same time trying not to mess myself. After the third session I said its not in my head no way!!!My wife is going crazy by this point with me not working so off I went with the same problems back to work. The first day I tried to do one flight. Had diarrhea threes times and kept taking Imodium trying to fight it. I didnt even get the engine started. I went back off work. Then my wife said your going to do whatever I tell you to do now! I was game because I just wanted this to be over. She sent me to a naturalpath doctor I thought that this was going to be a joke but played along as Im willing to do whatever by this point. This ended up being a game changer for me. I told her what was happening and she said tell me what you eat I the run of a day. I told her and she replied that it sounds like a FOOD INTOLERANCE and that its a simple blood test. I said that I already been tested she replied thats for allergies. I agreed to the test. About three weeks later she calls me say the results are in. I went to see her she said I had three different intolerances one was potatoes another was cane sugar with fruit and the last most important....soy. That day I eliminated all three and within a week all my symptoms were gone including my psoriasis even the little bumps on the back of my arms went away!!I was so happy the only problem now is that I have to prepare all my meals and read every label of anything I want to eat. So living on the road as an airline pilot makes it tough but Ive got it down now.Soy is what was causing all my problems and if I have it today it comes back at full fold. Now remember how I said I was taking Imodium GEL caps well one of the ingredients is SOY. Just like a car jamming on the brakes while hitting the gas!!So I had medical problems that regular doctors couldnt find went to a naturalpathic doctor and found out that I have a food intolerance to Soy.,Anxiety

Leaving aside the dumbness of the situation it hurt like a motherfucker and it even made a crickly noise when the impact ensued. My head hurt all night and the next day.Fortunately there was no bleeding but it's tuesday and my nose still feels pretty uncomfortable. I'm way too aware of it too so I constantly notice the pressure my glasses put on my nose and every time i rub my nose a little harder it hurts Should I go to a doctor? Could something be broken in there even tho there was no bleeding? I'd like to know I can stop worrying about it if it's no big deal ,Anxiety

34110,thankful to have found this sub I just stumbled upon this sub and I came here to say I am so thankful that it exists. I have been suffering from health anxiety and death centered panic disorder since I was 7 years old. I was so young that I had absolutely no idea what panic attacks were and concluded that there was something medically wrong with me causing my symptoms. This is where my health anxiety began. I wasn't able to fully be a child as i spent 8 years fearing for my life in silence thinking i was dying of this ailment or that ailment i was too afraid to tell my parents. Since then I am a 23 year old going to therapy and taking medications and working out my issues. It is so relieving to see that there are other people out there like me dealing with the same issues and who understand. I wish you all peace and strength in your fight!,Anxiety

34142,My HIV hypochondria is acting up again Hey guysSo I had been sleeping with this guy Rob on and off since 2016 and around August last year I started to get anxious about his status after stalking his exes facebook. I noticed she had cold sores on her lips and the last time I saw her in 2015 I saw her with cold sores. At first I thought it was normal because lots of people have and get cold sores but when I saw a recent picture of her on Facebook with the same if not worse cold sores. This concerned me because to my knowledge only people who are immuno compromised get recurring cold sores that often. I had spoken to Rob about his status earlier and he assured me he was healthy and I chose to believe him but after speaking to one of my girl friends she was surprised at how quick I was to believe him. She said verbatim guys can lie and I don't trust these uni boys keep in mind I live in Kenya where HIV is prevalent. This comment really freaked me out and I was sure he lied to me. I started freaking out and going crazy because of the picture of his ex coupled with my friend's comments I was sure I had contracted the virus. At this time I started sending him cryptic messages alluding to him infecting me but he didn't get which then forced me to plainly ask Are you HIV positive? He quickly replied No I'm not. I checked you also checked and I went and got tested and my results returned negative this wasn't a rapid test it was the one you wait two days for. I felt so bad about accusing him and we stopped speaking. Skip forward 3 months and we start fucking again. We met up and fucked 2 more times before I officially ended it for good. Now my mind is going back to thoughts that I'm HIV positive again. I keep thinking that maybe the first 6 times we met up and fucked the virus missed me and on the last 7th and 8th time the virus may have stuck. Is that possible? TLDR Had been hooking up with a guy since Dec 2016 and started getting anxious about his HIV status. Got tested in August 2017 and results came back negative. Started fucking him again in October 2017 and stopped in November. Is it possible that he is positive and the virus missed me the first 6 times we fucked and got me the last two times we did it? ,Anxiety

34031,Health Anxiety is ruining my life. So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat... I wasn't knocked out or anything A amp E said I had no serious injuries no bruise etc. My Health Anxiety's like Well how do you know you're fine you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up.I go to the doctor I phone two different doctors and they tell me I don't have any signs of a serious head injury... I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out so I go to the A amp E again a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I don't have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety. Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital he's fine and well now and I start to worry. A few days after visiting him I'm at my boyfriend's house and lying in bed... I'm getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest and become totally convinced that I'm having a heart attack or a stroke. It doesn't help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out I had lost half a stone in the space of a week. I thought that I was dying because I hadn't eaten and was having heart problems because of this.So now my HA brain thinks I've had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour.I've not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead but it's quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms... so I've remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety believing that I have some sort of serious condition... I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage...I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety she tells me that all of my symptoms headaches ringing in ears loss of sense of smell are being caused by my anxiety. She prescribes me with propranolol... naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication.Just today I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again. I've became kind of emotionally numb now because I'm constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me healthwise. I can't even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes Well maybe you can't enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke. I can't pay attention to things.It doesn't matter what the doctors say after a few hours I'm always convinced that they're wrong and that there's a serious problem with my brain and they haven't been able to find it yet.I'm so sick of this. Can anyone else relate?How do you convince yourself that there's nothing seriously wrong with you? ,Anxiety

34134,The worry of a pulomnary embolism is ruining my life!! Edit Darn...I should have spellchecked my title. I'm a 21 year old college student with GAD. In october I stood up after class and had a weird pain in my right calf. It went on everyday for over a month in total and I became convinced I had a blood clot. I went to the ER twice and got negative results on the blood clot tests. Still I couldn't reconcicle this. I kept having random chest pains shoulder pains palpitations etc. It might have just been anxiety idk. But the daily pain went away around late october. Just this past week the exact pain started up again in the exact same spot. I am getting anxious and having the same chest symptoms. I really hope this is all just my anxiety but I don't know. It feels so real. My october doctors appts and ER visits cost SO much money. I want to go to the ER again but they thought I was crazy last time and I can't put my family in more debt. So I don't know what to do. But I truly feel like I am having a pulmonary embolism and dying. Anyone else have similar issues? I can't focus and I am terrified. ,Anxiety

Yesterday I went to urgent care and there they confirmed I have the flu type A virus and a 102 feveras a hypochondriac this immediately kicked in my catastrophic thinking and always fearing the worst. They gave me Tamiflu which cost a pretty penny. Today I feel like dogshitaches pains coughing but my fever has seemed to drop. But Ive been sleeping like shit no more than 5 a night dont ya need to sleep to get rid of this?Im an extremely healthy person so being out of commission like this is literal hell lol. Is anyone else dealing with the flu? Any tips? Also Im going to be couch ridden while the misses is working so casual convo is welcomed. ,Anxiety
34038,Fear of medicaments Hey everyoneI have a little urinary infection and the doctor prescribed me 2 different medicaments urispas 200 mg 3x a day every 8 hours and ciproxina 500 mg 2x a day every 12 hours.But now I'm wondering if that's not a little too much for a urinary infection and I fear that it can have negative effects. It's maybe stupid but I'm now thinking that maybe I missed something and didn't understand that it wasn't to take at the same time the same week but one one week and the other the other week. Which wouldn't make any sense imo but I'm still wondering nonetheless.What do you guys think ? and btw english isn't my first language but I hope you understood everything,Anxiety

I spoke to my doctor and he believes it's posture related. But lately this week the chest discomfort has become more pronounced. I went to the gym two days ago and while I was on the elliptical I started feeling this almost burning sensation in my chest. It subsided somewhat once I stopped. That same sensation has come and gone since and now I have a spot that's sore to the touch right over my sternum. I'm thinking it's reflux related especially since I'm on meds for that and I've been burping a lot but does anyone else have any insight?

It's not on the hard palate but kind of in between that and the hard part of the gums on the inner side of teeth.If you take your tongue and reach it as far back as you can even past the final molar on top that's where it is.Anyways I felt with my tongue recently that there was a small lump. If I look in my mouth there is no sore or anything. But I can feel it with my tongue and finger. I just touched it with my hand again and I believe it is movable as well but I'm not 100 percent on that. It doesn't currently hurt to the touch but weeks ago it was tender when I would use my finger.I can't get it looked at until February 5th and my health anxiety was doing so well for about a year now but now I'm freaking out and it's affecting my sleep amongst other things.,Anxiety

Even hearing about broken bones or something like that I get anxious about doing anything! I'm glad I came across this.

I went to the doctor a week ago who diagnosed me with carpal tunnel. And gave me a brace that helped a little. Hand pain coincided with symptoms of carpal tunnel but it still made me nervous because my grandmother died of als and nerve pain always puts me on edge. I dont show any other signs of als besides very little muscle twitching. I am doing some weird things to test myself through out the day. For example. Testing my WPM words per minute that I can type. Which is 75 words per minute . I do this to see if I have any weakness in my hands I am standing on one foot to see if I can balance myself and shit like that. Also tonight I just came home from dinner and I was holding a fork and I noticed it felt very odd in my hands. It was a heavier than normal fork because it was at a steak house. I also have health anxiety but I wish I knew I was okay. So I can stop worrying. I feel some pins and needles in my hands and light shooting pain in my arms and feet and thighs.

Feel free to stop reading now!I don't know how this has got into my head but you know how these things can suddenly take hold right? You read something by mistake or someone tells you something you didn't want to hear about how this guy got diagnosed with Alzheimer's in his 30s or whatever and suddenly it's occupying your every waking moment. These ideas have taken root in my mind and I can't make them go away.I've been under a lot of stress at work for a long time. I'm responsible for the finances in a company which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for several years and in September I had my first ever panic attack over worries that we wouldn't be able to make payroll. I know intellectually that the symptoms I'm experiencing can rationally be explained by this but still. I can't stop thinking about it. I've felt over the past few months that I can't think or write as fluently as I could. I make more mistakes. I feel scatterbrained and foggy and I struggle to concentrate. I feel like it takes me longer to do things that should be much easier than I'm finding them.It's led me to start compulsively and repeatedly testing myself on things I should know which of course makes the anxiety and racing thoughts worse. Can't instantly recall all my PINs and passwords? Dementia. Can't find the right word while I'm talking? Dementia. Repeat myself while I'm typing a sentence? Dementia. Can't remember who starred in that film I saw last week? Dementia. Can't remember every detail of my journey to work? Dementia. It's taken me ages to write this.

33943,Head injury worries? I constantly worry about head injuries because I constantly worry if a hit to my head was significant to cause a concussion. For example I was laying in bed on my not very heavy laptop and I accidentally pushed it into my chin. It wasn't a super hard hit it didn't hurt but I immediately started worrying that I could have a concussion. My head was against a pillow too but the reading I did claimed that it's worse if your head doesn't move.I mean I don't notice myself feeling especially nauseaous or dizzy but I can't stop worrying. It seems like most concussion stories involve something more significant than that. Are small hits like that something to worry about? Does anyone have any expertise as when to start worrying about a concussion?,Anxiety

34065,Struggling with hantavirus fear... I can't rationalize out of it Hi all.. Never posted here but I've been struggling with health anxiety for about a year.I'm just really scared and anxious right now. I woke up yesterday with a cough which progressed to lung pain. I've never had lung pain so I think that is where a lot of this fear is coming from. Last night I got a fever and today I'm pretty sick. Fever mild sore throat productive cough and pretty bad body aches.See I'm freaking out about hantavirus because two weeks ago I dismantled a crappy structure in my sunroom where my dogs hang out. It was really really dusty. So much dust. I didn't wear a mask or anything. I didn't see any mice or droppings or anything but there was so much dust. To make matters worse I live in New Mexico where hantavirus is most common. I also live in a county where there was a case in 2016.This just doesn't feel like my normal kind of sick. It started in my lungs where usually when I get sick my first symptoms is a sore throat and stuffy nose. Now my nose is barely stuffy but I have a really bad cough. It's been a long time since I've had a fever and I can't recall getting muscle aches before this.All the factors combined are freaking me out really bad. I live in the state it is most common I cleaned out an enclosed space where there was lots of dust and now two weeks later within the incubation period I came down with a sickness that I feel is unusual for me.Someone please talk to me. I don't know what to do or how to get rid of this crazy fear I feel. I can't stop googling about hantavirus. I've been at it for hours since I woke up today.,Anxiety

34218,I'm afraid I have breast cancer in my 20s But I don't know if it's just paranoia anxiety or my period. My period's never caused this before. A few days before my period started one of my nips was hurting really bad and it kinda kept me awake for a bit then my breast in general was hurting. It went away after a day but now a week later it's happening again. Could it be breast cancer even though I'm 22? How do they even test for breast cancer? I don't know if I'd even qualify for getting a mammogram. I'm not sure if I still even have insurance. Also relevant I've always had a lump in one of my breasts ever since I was like 18. But it never worried me because I was so young and google said it was probably nothing. And it's been four years since I discovered it and it never killed me. What if though??? I'm definitely not pregnant so it isn't that.,Anxiety
33907,Heart health anxiety Hi all stumbled across this sub doing what else some late night symptom googling and I couldn't be more glad to see it. I've had generalized anxiety for years but recently it's started to manifest more as health anxiety triggered when my cat died of sudden onset congestive heart failure a few months ago. I've had chest pain in the upper left side for almost a week now and I can't seem to convince myself that I'm not dying. I've had two normal EKGs normal bloodwork except for an elevated d dimer level and a normal xray and CT. After all that I'm still not able to stop my anxiety that the twinge in my arm is a heart attack or the burning sensation in my back is an aortic dissection. Any suggestions for calming the anxiety beast? ,Anxiety
34071,Flu Fear! Oh boy. It's DEFINITELY that time of the year. The time of year to search all over the internet for articles on flu statistics and reading through the sad cases of people who were killed by it and subsequently sending yourself into a spiral of anxiety when you remember the fact that you did not get your flu shot this year.I've never gotten the flu. I haven't gotten the shot in a few years too I believe. My doctor asked me if I wanted it a few months ago but I foolishly said no at the time because I was in a rush to leave. Boy do I regret it now.I go back to college in about 2 weeks and I am stressed. I suppose it's not too late to go get it but that doesn't quell my anxiety over the fact it's only 10 effective anyway. Jeez.TLDR I'm afraid I'm going to be one of those rare cases of someone dying of the flu. I need to stop reading. I'm hoping for some solidarity here. Does anyone else have this fear especially considering this season is supposedly very bad?,Anxiety
33926,Dealing with Health Anxiety when you are looking forward to something that won't happen for several more months Does anyone's health anxiety increase when you start getting excited and start anticipating something that is a long time away like several months or a year? For example my wife and I booked a cruise in April. Everything is already paid for all we have to do is show up. Unfortunately when I start getting excited for it my health anxiety kicks in and I can't help but think that I might not make it because the symptoms that my anxiety produces and that my mind thinks are real will end me before I can experience it. I feel like that heart attack that I've been worried about having for the past 10 years will finally occur and prove every doctor I have seen wrong and that it will be the reason I won't be alive to experience this time that I am so looking forward too. Anyways just venting. This happens to me on most everything that I am looking forward too if it's a long ways out.,Anxiety

33964,Going to Battle HA? Hi AllFirst time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years with each year worse than the one before. For the last 6 months my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise I am thin and bruise like a peach or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I dont have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a wellrespected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. The problem? Im scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. Ive avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety. Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster? I just need to pickup the phone and make the call. Would love to make progress on this in 2018. Help?,Anxiety
34172,Does anyone ever read something about cancer and get scared? So Ive had like a larger swollen node on my neck like right by my jaw on the side for like 3 years this April showed my doc longggg time ago. It hurts when I think about it or feel it. I have another smaller one on my head and the same spot in my neck on the left. I get really obsessive when it even gets a little bigger like it is now because Ive been having some throat normal winter stuff going on. I told my therapist a long time ago and they never got bigger I never had symptoms but they showed up years ago when I had a bad cold. Also I think theyd show up from physicals that Ive had over the years? Since I had blood work done etc. I just read some post where a girl had lymphoma that they didnt even catch from a biopsy and my heart literally dropped it scared me that much. But she also had more nodes showing up. This stuff scares me so much and I cant talk to friends about it because they just dont understand. Its been 3 years I think Im fine I mean swollen nodes seem really common actually. I just need someone to tell me Im okay and reassure me cause hypochondria is a bitch ,Anxiety

I passed it off as my asthma but the coughing since then has gotten worse and today I am running a lowgrade fever. I'm really concerned that this is walking pneumonia and I just can't deal with that right now. I have to attend a funeral out of state this weekend and the thought of being sick and having to stay in a hotel room is just dreadful. The coughing is so persistent now that my throat is raw from it and I'm scared I'll start coughing up blood. Oddly enough my anxiety is not as bad over this but I'm still pretty stressed out nonetheless.,Anxiety
33958,Fear of brain aneurysm Hi everything started in April2016 when I read on the news that a boy of my age had an heart attack and died that made me scared so I started thinking about my own health and got really nervous one night before going to sleep I was feeling terrible with a lot of headache and my heart was pumping really fast but I managed to relax the thing is after that day I started feeling a burning sensation in a specific spot on the right side of my head from there on I started to panic a lot thinking I had an aneurysm and everything with the upcoming months that burning sensation became a light headache I went to the doctor and did a tomography and everything was fine he gave me a medication to take and advised me to start exercising. I did it and after about two weeks now I feel less frequent headaches but when I feel it it feels more intense I don't know if it was because of the exercises but I'm scared thinking this supposed aneurysm is getting larger and it's going to rupture Thanks.Everytime I go to the doctor my blood pressure is high because of tenseness I always think that these high blood pressure moments created an aneurysm ,Anxiety

It doesnt change from one side to the other like typical congestion. Ive used some oxymethoziline and zicam but the top part of my nostril is still clogged. It feels like somethings stuck in there. Ive used my neti pot 34 times since then but nothing comes out. No mucus no pressure just a nagging swelling.Is this just a common cold coming on? Nasal Polyps? I really dont wanna go see an ENT because I just saw one 34 months ago for allergies and they said my sinuses were healthy.If I lift up my nose and look inside it seems like the top of my nostril is more swollen on one side then the other.,Anxiety

I have been putting off going to the doc for a while and I have developed a rib hump on one side and rib torsion on the other. I have scoliosis I know I do. But going to the doctor and having them tell me I need surgery or won't get better scares me too much to handle. I don't really know why I am posting this. I guess it is nice to get off my chest. Some days it makes me very sad. The fact that I am a hypochondriac makes it scarier that something really is wrong with me. I'm always in pain by the end of the day.

34001,Having a horrible HA week. This week my HA has just went flying back off the rails. It started with the usual heart palpitations thinking im on the verge of cardiac arrest. Then i had a day of thinking i was gonna die of sepsis for literally no reason at all. Like i didnt even have an injury. I keep washing my hands too much. Cleaning the absolute shit out of my house. And as of yesterday my head has settled back on the good ole fear of getting Rhabdomyolysis from powerlifting. Because i think i overdid training yesterday. I had a back injury that kept me from doing specifically squats for like almost a year. So i have been afraid to do them. Deadlift and bench are fine and i go heavy. But i have really only been doing squats on the high volume speed work day. I was doing pause squats with only 1 plate per side on the bar. Its way too light and i have been afraid to go heavier. So yesterday i decided to do box squats 10 sets of 2 with 30 sec rest. With 1 plate and one chain per side. For resistance. It felt easy and i completed it and went on to do the rest of the exercises per usual. But then it sudden hit me that i did more weight with high volume than im used to on that particular exercise. I do more than double that weight on deadlift but still thats not the same. And ill probably get rhabdo. Later on in the evening i felt nauseous and i think i have some pain in my quads. No other symptoms. But i read you could have it and have NO SYMPTOMS WTF. Idk if the nausea and migraine i got was from the major anxiety from the rest of the week leading up to this or from rhabdo. Im really trying to not do the whole panic and go to the ER thing that i always do when i get like this. Im ruining my sleep schedule that i worked really hard to fix i have insomnia from ptsd and i didnt want to sleep until i knew i didnt have it. Im still panicking over it today. And as soon as i get anxiety the nausea comes back and i think about the minor soreness in my quads and how its going to kill me or make me very sick for a long time and ruin everything. Its fucking awful. ,Anxiety

33951,Advice Hey everybody you may have seen me post on here a lot recently and I do apologise for that I don't want to waste anyone's time. However since November when I'm stupidly ingested cannabis one night and ended up in hospital because my heart went to fast my anxiety has got so much worse. That night in hospital I was convinced I was gonna have a heart attack and die I was in so much pain and agony and in the ambulance the paramedics said my heart was going to fast but this was down to anxiety and nothing wrong with my heart. Same in the hospital they tried to treat my heart with medication but they couldn't slow it down they said this was because it was not an irregular heart it was normal just a bit fast once again due to anxiety so I was left over night and discharged the next day. December 4th I dislocated my knee for the 2nd time and while waiting to be seen in hospital my heart went to fast so they put me in a ward over night and did all the tests bloody tests for my heart and ecgs nothing once again and anxiety once again. Then after that is when my intrusive thoughts started and that went on for a few weeks I still get it on and off now however. But the last 23 days my heart has been going fast I'm losing my breath easily and I can feel my heart palpitating I've had countless doctors and tests look at me and nothing to do with my heart? I've even rang a hotline about this and they said anxiety does all this it seems to go in a cycle my thoughts then everything is okay for a while then my heart and thoughts again can anyone help?,Anxiety

34026,Scary throat problems I had 2 respiratory infections in about a span of a month and when it finally began to clear up I had an persistent globule feeling in the opening of my throat. After about a week later that two passed and I began to have pain in the right side of my chest usually after eating. Most recently I've been having this electric shock feeling in the opening of my throat when I yawn or sometimes just stretch my neck. I feel like it maybe happened occasionally over the last couple weeks but I feel like the frequency and intensity is increasing with time. Someone please help.,Anxiety

34151,Wheezing constricted airways after exercising in the cold I've been doing the Couchto5K running program for about a month. It's been in the 40s and 50s a lot lately when I go running. I'm able to complete my runs fine but I notice after getting home that the deepest parts of my lungs feel tight or constricted. I can force a deep breath but when I do I hear this wheezing like the airways are stretching back open. Usually after about 30 60 min or so it's back to normal.I tried wearing a neck gaiter after the first time and it got a lot better but was still there. I went to the doctor and described all this and he listened to my lungs. He said my lungs sounded perfect. And that it's normal to have that wheezing after exercising in the cold since your airways constrict and forcing them open creates a spasm that makes that wheezing sound. He also said as long as it's only that and not actual shortness of breath then it's nothing to worry about and to continue running preferably when it stops being cold.Anyway just wondering if anyone else can relate to this or can offer any other support. It is an irrational thing at this point since I've been to the doctor and described exactly what was going on to him. Knowing the way my anxiety works I suspect the reasons I haven't dropped it are that he didn't hear it actually doing it and to me it sounds strange and that I secretly worry it's a small start to a bigger lung issue I've had a couple relatives pass away after getting pulmonary fibrosis which definitely is in my head when anything lungrelated is going on. Any tips or other support would be fantastic!PS I refuse to google it or anything else for that matter but if anyone has support for pulmonary fibrosis worries that would help too. I believe for my relatives that started with gradually dropping oxygen levels and some strange sounds the doctors could hear in their breathing. So nothing like what I'm describing here .. if only health anxiety used the rational side of the brain!,Anxiety
33957,fear of appendicitis Hello I just found this subreddit so I'm new here. I felt a weird pressure to the left of my right hip bone yesterday and this is a symptom of appendicitis. I asked my mom about it and she told me to lift up my legs when I lifted up my leg I felt no pain so she said I was fine. It doesn't hurt but it's just a weird pressure feeling. Yesterday it was a constant pressure feeling but today it's more random. I didn't feel anything until a couple minutes ago. I know appendicitis is very painful so I don't know if I actually have it or if my mind is playing tricks on me. I had an anxiety attack over this yesterday and I'm really scared of having it. also sorry this is kind of a messy post. This is really annoying Lol. I want to calm myself down but idk how. Any help is appreciated on how to calm down and focus on anything else. ,Anxiety

Where I would have an Adams apple if I were a guy and it hurt so bad. Its extremely tender and sore and every position I can feel it. Almost like its tight. I cant tell if theres a lump or anything but the pain scares me. It really is sore and like a 6 on pain scale. Everything Ive read is saying get it checked it out and could be cancerous.

34072,Hip still swollen 4 months after fall anxiety about it hangs over me. About months ago I fell and landed on my hip. I stayed down for a minute or two only because I didn't think it would be a good idea to get up immediately but then I got up and was fine. It was sore that night but that was about it. The swelling started that night too. Maybe a week and a half later I went to the doctor about it. He didn't do any xrays but he felt around and tested my range of motion. My range of motion was fine and I didn't have any pain and he said everything felt like normal swelling. He said it looked like the normal response to a fall and that swelling can take 5 weeks to heal I think. So here I am 17 weeks later and my hip is still swollen. There was a moment where it hurt for a bit about 2 months ago but that was only for a week or two. The anxiety about it hangs over me. It's always there as something that actually shouldn't be happening something that to me is not easily explainable.,Anxiety

34146,Is it normal to get screened for psychosis even though I dont have any symptoms of it??? Ok let me explain what is going on. Hope some of you can relate to this. My anxiety is through the roof.Couple of years back I had stressinduced panic anxiety with all the classic symptoms rapid heartbeat crazy tensions panic attacks fatique etc.. My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on and I kept coming to the worst conclusions gt this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year and haven't had any of this for 2 years straight.Now 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed nothing major I assumed it was due to the winter coming messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed what is happening to me am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor saying that I felt off a bit emotionally numb and racing thoughts 247. I took a depression test there but kinda showed nothing so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions which I have had nothing of never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.So I slowly started thinking about the questions what if I am gonna hallucinate see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 247 dpdr constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It's like my brain is in super defence mode recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.I went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before thinking that I must be super crazy.Recently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations and I described again the same things. That I've never had them never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something delusional thoughts pop up in my head because of my obsession about the fear what if I thought someone were actually following me etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis because she thinks I am that apparently even though I don't have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.This is throwing me off what the f is happening. Am I losing control I can't believe this is happening. Is this normal to get screened for??? I feel so detatched right now stuck in full blown overanalyzing mode of my surroundings I can't relax. What if I am going schizophrenic or psycotic????Sorry for my grammar my anxiety has never been worse.,Anxiety

34067,Always think I have cancer So I remember it started in high school where I started having a bump grow on a specific spot on my head and I never had any real fear before this time. I remember sitting in my class googling bump in that location and it said swollen lymph node which could be a sign of cancer. At first I was like ok no its probably just a pimple but then two weeks after that I got another one on my head where another lymph node was supposed to be located. I was terrified and I thought this was it. I went to the doctors made them send me to specialists the whole 9 yards and they kept telling me thats not a lymph node but I was convinced they had no idea what they were talking about because I read so many articles on google. Turns out they were just cysts. Since then that has sparked my fear of always thinking I had cancer. That was 3 years ago and since then I have been convinced I had bone cancer brain cancer and now stomach cancer. I have been a heavy weed smoker for a while and I started to get a tightness and cramping pains in my stomach I associated with the weed. So I quit and 2 days after quitting I got really bad runs I was nauseas and I threw up a couple times. I lost 15 pounds during this period which was a feeder into yep its cancer. The strange thing is when I stared getting better my symptoms only appeared in the morning. After this period I thought maybe it was just a sickness and not the weed so I smoked all day everyday again for another week but then started waking up nauseas so I quit again and again a couple days after quitting I got the runs. Its been brutal and I have since gotten a lot better. Although my stomach still hasnt gone back to normal Im now terrified every morning because thats usually when I go the bathroom and I freak out I have stomach cancer. I wouldnt leave my doctor alone at the time and made her run so many tests and everything always came back fine. I just want to know how some people got over this irrational fear. Im only 19 and on the cancer statistics website shows less than 1 of people who get this cancer are under 20 and most of them have a family history of it so my chances are very unlikely which I can understand but a part of me is still terrified. Thanks in advance! ,Anxiety

33969,question regarding fingers slightly moving. Is it normal?Not sure if I can classify it as 'tremors'Basically from what I've seen with different kinds of videos regarding tremors it doesn't look like it.Let's say I put my hands in the air facing my palm or just in the bed resting it doesn't shake or what.But sometimes if I look at them long enough I notice it they slightly move.Not sure if I'm doing it voluntarily I'm being anxious thus making it move or maybe because I'm not used to holding that kind of position it kinda moves because of it?If anything I type a lot in a computer. Upon searching I've seen that they might just been twitching due to fatigue so maybe that's what it is?As much as possible I don't want to go to a doctor just because of this.Thanks,Anxiety

34107,I'm convinced I have HIV. I've had a bit of HIVphobia for a while now and I realize now it was mostly unfounded. But this summer it got worse. I have no job right now and I wasn't going to school so I spent most of the summer inside to an unhealthy extent. When I did go out for long enough I developed a rash that I think is PMLE which is a mild allergy to sunlight not fun but harmless. Then I saw that it can be a symptom of HIV infection. Granted I've never had this reaction before. The page said it can develop around my age and nearnonexistent sun exposure mixed with periods of high exposure can probably cause reactions like that especially since it was a pretty brutal summer but I'm still terrified.Around this time I also started to develop these purplish veinlike patterns on my legs and that just made me panic even more because I couldn't just explain that away. I am overweight and I think I gained some weight during the summer so I thought of stretch marks but aren't those usually white? They seem to be going away now but that's only a little comforting.I've never done drugs or even had sex. But I remember finding an unexplained cut on my finger a few years ago that I'm afraid might have been from a needle in the trash where I worked at the time. I don't remember exactly when that happened. I haven't been getting sick often or having issues with infections but would I really notice those things if my immune system wasn't working properly? Isn't the immune system where most of the symptoms come from?I still haven't been going out as much as I probably should and I realize that I probably have a severe vitamin D deficiency so that might be causing some of this but I don't know if it can explain everything. I keep checking my skin for any changes fearing the worst. I'm really scared.,Anxiety
33913,Flat Stool and Dull Stomach Pain. Could it be IBS? Colon Cancer? Just flat out Anxiety? Lately I've noticed that my stool has been softer floating and generally flatter than before. They are not absurdly flat you'd only notice it if you examined them closely because they float around. I've really noticed this over the past couple of weeks. I haven't really had a solid and long stool in a while. In addition to this I've been having some dull abdominal pain that kind of radiates on my sides and in the middle of my abdomen. Nothing that keeps me from walking around and exercising though. The pain radiates for a couple of minutes and subsides when I stop thinking about it.I went to the doctor two weeks ago complaining about the abdominal pain this was before I noticed anything about the poop. I had a blood test and a urine test taken and basically they came back all clear. For the record I'm 19 male and overweight. My college diet combined with inaccessibility to the gym has caused me to gain weight over the past two years.My biggest questions for are these When is the right time to contact my doctor again? Since the blood and urine tests came back completely normal is it right to assume that my stool is just a byproduct of me being anxious and general change of diet? I'm on my school's winter break. Meaning this is a big diet change and physical activity change. I'm no longer eating food in bad dining halls I'm making my own.IBS? Colon Cancer?? Please help me out.

34048,I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 56 years now however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.About a year and a half ago I started saying 'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden I still say it sometimes but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness shortness of breath chest pains headaches shaking etc. I knowhope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind. ,Anxiety

33989,WARNING graphic. Stomach Flu Food Poisoning or neither? Hellolast night after going out with my boyfriend to get Mongolian Grill I got back to his house and my head began hurting like a migraine. What was even worse is a few minutes later my stomach started feeling weird. I brushed it off and was able to ignore it however normally if it is nothing or I am having motion sickness it dies down after a while. It did not. I began feeling REALLY nauseous and just plain weird. I was also having a lot of small burps and...gas down there. So then I thought must be gas as this has happened before. 3 hours go by and I literally cannot move or I feel like I am going to throw up. We go to his moms house and I try to lay down and sleep. And then I got that feeling maybe 30 minutes later went to the bathroom and puked up all of my food. I have never puked so much in my life. It hurt really bad and to make it worse every 30mins1hr after that I threw up 8 more times as you can imagine I got ZERO sleep. It has now been about 5 hours since I threw up and I feel absolutely fine. My stomach does feel a little raw as expected. But I am able to sip gatorade and suck on ice chips right now with zero desire to eat. This is where things get nastier about 20 minutes ago I was laying here kind of sitting up and I felt gas down there so I obviously decided to let it out. Worst mistake because I SUDDENLY FELT IT WAS WET DOWN THERE. And boy was it.I ran full speed to the restroom and it turns out to be what appeared as a mixture of super watery diarrhea and vomit. Absolutely disgusting I showered and here I am now. hours ago before the last few times I puked I did have to poop it was weird it came out of nowhere and I went and it was big and soft. And then this!What makes my boyfriends mom suspect it is the stomach flu is because my boyfriends sisters boyfriend threw up the other night too however she didnt get sick I was nowhere near him and he had a concussion. I dont have a fever either atleast I dont think I do?I feel like food poisoning is the culprit because I have had it before and this same thing happened besides the bathroom situation from what I remember. Just constant throwing up over and over again. I did eat a lot of lettuce and spinach so I hope it isnt ecoli.Any advice would be appreciated. ,Anxiety
34127,ExSmoker Fear and Excessive Research Hi everyone.As a health anxiety sufferer I have an interesting story to share.A few years ago I picked up a habit of smoking hookah. I smoked cigars for a bit as well throughout the same period.I smoked hookah probably between 100 and 200 times in all.Once I left my masters program a few years later I felt a pain in my back. This was my first bout with health anxiety. I couldn't figure out what was causing it so Googling symptoms led me to lung cancer.I thought I smoked so it could be true. Then I saw this awful number online Hookah 100 Cigarettes according to various news organizations citing the WHO.This terrified me. I smoked the equivalent of FIVE PACKS every time I smoked?!Of course eventually I found out that lung cancer was not the case. It was a messed up nerve. Physical therapy and some posture fixes and that particular back pain is more under control. I also have chronic back pain I believe as a result of anxiety and a lack of movement.Fast forward a few years.At the beginning of this year I started having a high level of health anxiety after visiting the dermatologist and having some moles removed. They were dysplastic nevuses he removed them but honestly probably didn't even need to.I started freaking out about melanoma but when I realized I could relatively well see and manage that if it were to happen as long as I stay vigilant about skin checks and doc checkups melanoma is not a big threat.But then the lung cancer scare came back.I frantically tried to understand how much damage had I done. Pack years how many do I have? 1? 5? 10?I've read probably 100 different studies done a thousand google searches to understand the connection between hookah smoking and lung cancer.Long story short this led me down a path of compulsively studying. I also went back and reconstructed my year of smoking down to the daybyday level. I've requested transaction logs from my bank to see when I was in a particular place when COULD I have smoked?Some of this was actually helpful. I narrowed down my smoking to a possible 215 days many of which I likely didn't smoke anyway. So I shrunk that fear a bit by looking at the reality.Some of the other research I did was helpful too looking into the claim of 100cigarette equivalence revealed that the number stated is referring to the volume of smoke not necessarily the equivalence of hazard. I can't take a solid guess as to a better number but the research I've read looks like much less than 100 for an average session.Lastly a lot of this research was NOT helpful as my interpretation of the research caused me to catastrophize it.My setup is a perfect example of what would drive a health anxiety sufferer insane Reason to believe that something bad could happen my shortlived smoking habit ambiguity on the risk very little research on hookah and its impact on your health lots of scary media surrounding smoking and finally my dodgy memory of how often and how much I smoked during that year.This is a perfect recipe for fear for a health anxiety sufferer.My wife and I had our first son last year. All of this fear has grown into a tragic story where my son loses his father at a young age because his father smoked hookah for a year. This all sounds silly from the outside but completely plausible from the inside.I want to encourage health anxiety sufferers who have analytical brains like me focus on what is in front of you today. There is nothing you can do to change what happened yesterday. Be aware but don't ruminate. Look for actions you can take today to be healthy not reasons why you aren't healthy.I'm learning that no matter what risk levels I have there is nothing I can do to nail that down perfectly and trying to nail it down keeps rumination and negative thoughts constantly in my head. The whatif questions stay present. The hyperfocusing on what my shortened life would look like that pervades my mental state.Now today is the day where I look at what I have and say thank you for it. Look at my past and accept it. Look at my risk and accept it. Look at the future with belief and hope for the best rather than constantly fearing the worst.,Anxiety

34182,Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.As a preface Im a 24 year old woman.About a month ago I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day it was no longer raised completely but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area about the size of a quarter. No pain no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bugbite my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in. This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was it could be a pimpleskin irritation and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 23 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didnt think it was anything to worry about.Again this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didnt find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didnt go away in two weeks the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. That day I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course I said yes. When I was there I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again said the same thing everyone else did. Its most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 23 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I of course opted for the biopsy.Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. Its much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare especially for someone my age but its the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 34 hours a night Im having horrible nightmares dizziness headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them the left one is bigger than the right always has been but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way.Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. Im struggling to meet deadlines at work. Im letting my house go to shit. I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.I guess what Im looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. Im so depressed. Im missing out on so much. Any words of advice would be so appreciated.,Anxiety

34227,Terrified of a brain CT scan I had Sorry guys long post but I just need to get this off my chest and I feel like I'm going crazy...Firstly I'm a 23 y.o. male in relatively good health training and playing sports 4ish times a week.So recently I was having a weird pain on the right side of my brain and ongoing pressure that didn't go away for about 4 days. Eventually I went to the doctor who said we should do a 'scan' for reassurance to check if it was serious.I stupidly just went along with radiology and did a brain CT scan when I could have asked for an MRI. Now days later I'm absolutely terrified of the affects of that CT radiation on my brainbody and so much regret I didn't speak up and demand an MRI instead. I've been emailing the clinic and they said that on average a brain CT with the machine Siemens 64 slice Perspective they use gives 1 mSv for a brain CT I'm worried that this is just for a brain scan and that the person doing it would have hit my head among other body parts so the dosage might have been higher. I've now been reading about ionizing radiation for the past few days nonstop with occasional glimpses of hope about how overall the radiation impacted me is nominal compared to the background we receive. But then there are so many questions that stress me out is receiving a large dose in one go the same as a 23 a year of exposure to the body? How much radiation can our bodies deal with? Is there now mutated DNA in my body that could cause problems in the future? Am I more sensitive to radiation than a normal person?I can't sleep properly and I spend my days distracted reading about the odds of contracting a fatal cancer because of a stupid CT scan I could have said no to. I just want some proof to say look the radiation you received is minor and there is almost no risk with the CT. I've read every resource there is I think and done every calculator I could and it still stresses me out. This fear of cancer is partially because I lost my mother when I was quite young to lung cancer and I'm just terrified hereditary impact this has on metldr Had a brain CT worried about brain tumourscancer and now worried the scan could have done more harm then good.,Anxiety
34057,Lymph node anxiety Hi guys long time lurker here. For about the past 6 months Ive had my health anxiety under control or at least I accepted the anxiety as it was. I just got back from a vacation and for some reason my lymph nodes under my jaw are swollen. Im rather thin and theyre not terribly noticeable but if I feel around its maybe a little smaller than the size of my thumb. Ive just been freaking out a bit even though I know that I got tons of mosquito bites which can make lymph nodes noticeable on my trip and I was on a plane with a bunch of sick people. I just wanted to post so that I didnt keep this in my head. I guess Ill just roll with it and if they dont go down in a few weeks Ill get them checked out. Thanks for letting me vent.,Anxiety

34179,Skin on back and arms feels like it's burning? Hello all. I'm new to the subreddit but I wanted to see if anyone could help put my mind at ease. For the last couple of months my mom's health has not been the best.To make things worse I've been smoking weed and it's pretty much been giving me panic attacks everyday. I stopped smoking weed a couple days ago to see if it would help. Anyways In the beginning of last week she was admitted to the hospital and among other things it really stressed me out. That Monday I woke up in the middle of the night sweating hungry and cold. I was pacing back and forth and I started googling my symptoms I know bad idea and I came across peripheral neuropathy. I googled the causes of that MS was one of the results and I started to freak out. I googled relentlessly for the next week because the burning on my back and arms has not stopped since and it's put all my senses on high alert. I also feel like cold electricity going up the back of my head I I'ven really anxious ever since and it's started to affect me. I went to the hospital and got a CT scan on my neck and they found nothing. I read online that one of the ways to diagnose MS was to do an MRI of the brain and spine to look for lesions so I'm not surprised that the CT scan came back clear. I haven't been back to the hospital but the symptoms just haven't stopped. Now I'm also getting twitches all over and my muscles feel weak but I think that's just the anxiety playing tricks on me. I went to the doctor this morning and explained to her all my symptoms. She did some basic strength tests and she told me that the burning skin can be a symptom of anxiety. I've also googled burning skin and anxiety can cause that but it still hasn't really made me feel better. I had some blood work done and she prescribed me muscle relaxers and an antidepressant and told me to come back in 3 weeks. Could all my symptoms really just be from anxiety? The burning also at times can feel like my skin is cold but when I touch it it's not. I have noticed that my symptoms do go down a bit if I calm down a bit. Anyone else experience something similar? ,Anxiety

34051,Chest Hey guys i hope everyone is well! This weekend i had slight chest pain and difficulty breathing aswell as a stuffy blocked nose. It was after hours so my local GP doctors surgery was closed meaning the next best thing was the ER..i heard about this deadly flu going around and got my ass straight to the ER as soon as i started feeling this. They did heart monitoring and blood sample as well as a chest x ray and said everything was clear and that it must just be an infection. I was prescribed amoxicillin 500mg 4 a day spread out evenly. I feel better in the sense that my chest isnt as breathless and my nose isnt as stuffy and im generally perkier but the chest pain is still there and im worried about it. What if its fluid in my lung or pneumonia? Its just bizarre that my flulike symptoms have essentially gone in the past 40 hours after 2 days on antibiotics yet i still feel this uncomfortable worrying chest! Any advice? ,Anxiety

34025,Blood??? in Stool Alright so this is an issue Ive had on and off for years and I dont know what to do. So basically sometimes I have red spots in my stool. I say spots because it doesnt fill the whole bowl the whole stool isnt red just red spots. It also appears on my toilet paper time to time. Im 21 now and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test found nothing but a hemroid sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. Its happened on and off since then and usually I either know its hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however its gotten worse. About a month ago as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. Ive been fine this past month but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days Ive noticed the same red spots. Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still dont really think its blood but if thats the case wouldnt it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a spot as Ive described. Part of me wants to go to the doctor but I was just verified a month ago that it wasnt blood and I feel going again will just lead to the same result. Im just wondering is it normal to have any redness in your stool once in a while from food and Im just overly vigilante as health anxiety definitely has made me or is there more to it.

33974,Health Anxiety after panic attack Almost a year ago I had a panic attack that I thought was a heart attack. I've never had either and at the time I didn't know that panic attack symptoms can mimic heart attacks. I had a friend take me to the ER and I was freaking out in the ER while waiting to be seen. I remember thinking man this is it this is how I'm going to die and I'm away from family wife and kids and everyone I love and I'm stuck in a place I hate and it scared me so badly. Anyway since then I've almost had myself convinced that I was going to die and it was going to be from a heart attack. I've been prescribed Buspirone and it keeps me from having panic attacks and I've come a long way from the panic attacks every day to almost having none. There's been a few times in the past few months where if I wasn't taking medication I could've had a pretty bad attack. One of them was last week where my mind just kind of ran away while I was driving home from work and for some reason my mind was looping you're gonna die and probably run into oncoming traffic look now you're barely breathing and I had to calm myself down. It sometimes takes me a really long to get calm and sometimes I can calm myself almost immediately. The thing about this though that I really hate is that the anxiety is always there always either in the back of my mind or I'm actively thinking about it. I've set an appointment with a psychologist for a few weeks from now and I really want to get off the meds. They have some side effects that I really don't like and they are considered mild. Are there any of you who suffer from the same kind of health anxiety that I do? I don't know anyone personally who does at least not in the way it is with me. Some coworkers had anxiety issues in the recent past but it looks like I'm the only one who suffers 247 and it looks like it's a permanent thing in my life. ,Anxiety

34197,Think Before You Post why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety. Hey rhealthanxiety Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive. So you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains heart palpitations stomach problems poop problems any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about. You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out but doubt their opinion.All of these have happened to me and happen to many many other HA sufferers which is completely okay. However the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.Usually what I would do is post here explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.All of this felt like what I had to do a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine. In the short term yes it made me feel better but this was only short lived.This might also account for medical tests I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT colonoscopy or endoscopy or whatever it might be would make all their worries go away. Which after the short term relief the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety I speak from experience.One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.So if you don't seek that reassurance what's going to happen? For me at first it was unbareable anxiety and just an extreme desire to check I was okay whether that was through posting to the subreddit the discord asking family checking my body for lumps checking my lymph nodes etc. You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance do something mindful something genuinely healthy for the mind. As when in a very high anxiety situation sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future. You can do many things for me it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else not an easy task by any means but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance. You could possibly try meditation though if you don't regularly practice it it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels. You could try relaxing music your favourite food anything else that enhances your mood whatever works for you. During this time you will experience anxiety potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance but I promise you in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.When you seek reassurance you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately because usually it feels like the right thing and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me try not seeking it.It'll be very similar to this graphhttpsthegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.ukwpcontentuploads201512anxietyrepeatedexposuregraph.png the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this. Seriously it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety I've been there hundreds of times and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety. ,Anxiety

34158,Scared about temporal arteritis Adding to all the cancers and heart conditions I've been worried about I just read about temporal arteritis and I'm worried about it too. I'm a 23 year old white male. For the past couple days I've had tenderness near my right temple only. There's no constant pain but it hurts when I put mild to moderate pressure on a certain part of the bone behindunder the temple. I can feel a slight bump there but there's an essentially symmetrical one on the other side with no tenderness with the same amount of pressure. I do have many other symptoms of temporal arteritis including frequent headaches although generally mild tiredness in limbs and general tiredness but I've had all that for a long time and often can be traced to specific causes like poor sleeping habits and dehydration. I don't have any of the jaw pain or tiredness any more so than I would normally get after chewing for a long time anyway although sometimes my mouth does feel slightly stiff if I haven't opened it for a while. I do have a bad habit of clenchinggrinding my teeth that I've had for most of my life and I've had TMJassociated pain before. I don't think I've had any vision loss but sometimes I do find it harder to focus or I feel like I'm not seeing quite as well when I' tired so I can't say for sure.

She told me she had been tested for STDs since the last time she had sex I had had blood work and urine work done since the last time I had had sex also. About a week later she told me she had missed her period and we were worried about pregnancy. She was sick for a few days nauseous and fatigued. After a while she got better but during that time I asked if she had blood work done to which she replied no just urine. She thought the same negative thoughts as me she also has health anxiety. When she got better she assured me that she had just been stressed not eating right and I had nothing to worry about. She even called me to reassure me.Now I am studying abroad in the Middle East and I started feeling sick last week. I had a stomach ache normal for new bacteria in food and then a sore throat and congestion. Instantly I thought this was the worst and that I had HIV. Again I told her I was freaking out but she reassured me that I was fine and so was she. I found out that my friend in the program has had the same symptoms as me and we guessed it was allergies.Now Ive been taking antihistamines and feel better but the thought wont leave my mind. I understand that its very hard to get anything through vaginal intercourse plus I am circumcised 0.08 that she has it 0.04 chance that I could get it from her if she was . Its hard to get tested in the country Im in because thats simply how it is. Ive asked her to get tested but she said shes been very busy and she told me I need to get help for my anxiety. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist because I have a history of panicking and anxiety. Should I be worried about this?Thanks and sorry for long read.,Anxiety

34120,Suspect hypocalcemia help Hey stab in the dark of where to post this but really hoping for some help. I've been getting a few symptoms which line up with that of hypocalcemia most prominently tingling numbness around my mouth and it's understandable as I've avoided dairy for quite some time as it wreaks havoc on my skin.It's come on more over the past few months since I've been exercising running and liftinga lot more and I'm not able to relax it feels horrible. I'm just wondering if it is hypocalcemia then a calcium supplement should help?I'm not able to go to the doctors for blood work for just under a month because I'm at uni and I literally avoid dairy like it's the plague. Any help is appreciated.,Anxiety

34059,Possible Ear Infection? So my left ear is a bit red and itchy it also feels like its burning and its tender to touch in certain places especially just before the inside of the ear and behind the ear like the rounded bit on the outside.I think it might be my earphones that have caused the problem so Ive stopped using them for a couple days.Im not sure if this is something I should go to the doctor about or not. I know ear infections and stuff dont really need treated but I wasnt sure if I should just wait it out or go see a doctor about it. ,Anxiety

33948,Should a low blood pressure and pulse rate be concerning at an odd time? I was at this enormous concert recently over 10000 people in one room 5 big screens lord knows how many speakers etc. It was the first concert I've ever been to because I don't really like loud noise but there were a couple speakers there I wanted to see it was more of a conference with several hours of music. Previously unbeknownst to me the music was incredibly loud and there were continuous lights flashing all different colors and directions. I'm a pretty introverted quiet guy so this wasn't my idea of a good time but that's not confusing.What confuses me is that my pulse dropped. It was a day long event but I'm in good shape so I doubt that was an issue. I noticed because I started getting dizzy got a headache and was tired enough to sit and close my eyes amidst all the hype. To my chagrin and embarrassment several people asked me if I was okay which I appreciated but felt deeply uncomfortable with. My resting heart rate is about 64 and I'd thought it'd be elevated with the very overwhelming to me at least stimulus for an extended period of time. Instead I measured it and it was right at 42. Wtf was going on? I didn't leave because I didn't want to ruin everyone's time but seriously is something wrong with me? No one else had this. It made me feel alienated and uncomfortable when I should have been having a great time. I've never had a panic attack or any prolonged health issues so idk what happened. Was this just an anxiety thing or is that an actual health issue. I'm not going to ask anyone because frankly it was embarrassing. To clarify I'm not asking you to diagnose anything I just want to if anyone has felt something similar. Thanks in advance for any help.Edit Grammar and spelling,Anxiety

I tried to see what was blocking the light and leaving a shadow on my wall. Of course I looked directly into the lens for a second and it left a first white dot that then became green and black. I could see it for ten minutes or so. And its pretty much gone but it feels like Ive lost some center focus. Can this repair itself or have I permanent vision damage now ?Ill go see a doctor tomorrow. Just wonder if anyone has tried something like that. A google search didnt really yield any results which makes me think i might just be worrying too much. Im writing this in the dark on my phone and there arent any noticeable visual artifacts but I have an issue with looking at faces on tv.

33935,I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old male and im 6' 3 170 lbsLet me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.Two years later this last summer i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painfultender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds in muscle over the last 6 months.What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.Also i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years,Anxiety
34003,Hollow feeling in chest For the past couple of weeks Ive had this paindiscomfort in my chest. Sometimes its a dull pain in the center sometimes sharp. I also get this weird weak feeling in my chest. It feels sort of hollow. Ill get a flutter once in a while. Weird. Ive had all the tests a few months ago. EKG blood test chest Xray echo. All normal. Any ideas? I am known for being anxious about my heart and overall health. I just really want this to stopThanks ,Anxiety

33970,I finally saw the cardiologist today I had multiple ECGs bloodwork done I wore a twoweek loop and I had an echocardiogram over a month ago and today I did a stress test. I've been having HORRIBLE anxiety about my heart for over a month and a half. My heart is completely healthy. No blockages and no damage to it whatsoever. This is one of my happier days!!! They told me the chest pain which I can reproduce by touching it is likely caused by either anxiety or costochondritis and the heavy tightness is likely anemia which I can deal with much better than heart disease. The left arm pain is probably from inflammation because I lay on it so awkwardly and for too long at night. I'm OK ' Anxiety is a bitch guys. It can make you truly believe and FEEL the most frustrating and uncomfortable symptoms. I'm not saying to dismiss everything as anxiety it will always be better to see a doctor but what I am saying is none of you are alone. Thanks to everyone here who supported me through this. I can move on and focus on fixing my inflammation and anemia!! ,Anxiety
34200,Loss of appetite for over a month I believe I got the flu right on Christmas Day most likely caused by eating extremely spicy popcorn which I have been eating somewhat frequently prior. Went to the ER about 4 days after and got nothing but laughs from the doctor saying there's nothing wrong. Been eating nothing but rice porridge and shredded pork for over a week. I could hold food down but have completely lost the urge to eat since would occasionally eat out to try and care for my hunger pangs that I think I was having. At first it was difficult to eat or even will myself to eat got better then got worse again. At this point I could hardly eat and have to seriously think about whether or not I am hungry since it's seemingly impossible to tell when it was as easy as a stomach growl before then. 56 days ago I think I got food poisoning now I absolutely can't eat anything. Got the flu shot maybe 2 days prior and things only seemed to get worse then. Would often puke but wouldn't see food come back out mostly what looked like saliva had nothing but rice porridge after all. Went to the doctor's office and was prescribed Ranitidine the medication may have cause this sense of looming nervousness but it's most likely just me since I've been fine with it every other time after about the second day of taking it or so. Decided that it was now necessary to force feed myself to jumpstart my appetite along with light walking 12 miles after each meal or so I wasn't physically active at all prior worse since I was bedridden during the flu. I fear that I'm overeating when I've been told to eat 56 small meals each day I've also grown terribly impatient with my recovery seeing as how this has been going on for over a month. I would often feel incredibly miserable and every day I was plagued with anxiety until I decided to force feed myself I don't care about getting fat anymore I just want my appetite back but now I'm starting to fear that I'm going about this the wrong way. The feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have hardly gotten better and while I don't suspect my loss of appetite is due to my anxiety I can never be too sure. The whole reason why I even had anxiety in the first place was because of how sudden my loss of appetite was and how I was unable to self diagnose myself since I felt no abdominal pain whatsoever I'm at a loss as to what's going on with my body. ,Anxiety
34193,Terrified of PCOS For the past 7 months the fear of developing PCOS has taken over me despite have no symptoms. Ive always had normal periods. They always come every 28 days and last for 5. Not only that but Ive always been skinny I havent had a bad acne breakout since I was 14 I dont get any facial hair aside from a little on my upper lip and I dont think its possible for me to have diabetes. But I gained 3 pounds this month. And my period started yesterday and then completely stopped. So now Im convinced I have it and I cant think about anything else. The last time PCOS fears struck me I had two panic attacks in a row and was a state of high stress for a while. My period ended up coming a week and a half early which just made the anxiety worse. Eventually everything went back to normal but for some reason Im convinced that wont happen this time. I know PCOS is not a death sentence but I have never worried so much about an illness ,Anxiety

34066,Hair fall So I've posted here before regarding my hair loss issue. I mentioned in my previous post that I have a very oily scalp and a lot of dandruff on my hair and as a result I have bald patches. Some people recommend me to see the doctor for second opinion so I visited another dermatologist today. She was able to diagnose my problem. She said I have a very severe hair loss at a very early age I'm only 17. The problem she mentioned was androgenic alopecia. She said normally this problem is caused because of genetics but since none of my family members are bald it's probably due to an harmonal imbalance. So I'm wondering is there anyone who suffered from a similar problem and how did they manage to recover their hair?,Anxiety

33940,Slipped and fell two weeks ago and afraid of getting a scan I slipped and fell on my right side. I only had a small visible bruise on my upper thigh by my waist.However it seems it affected my whole leg. My upper thigh is tight and it feels like if you exercised and overstretched it. My knee is tight also doesn't seem smooth when I move it and has been poppingcracking alot more. I have full range of motion but everything still feels sore. I really wanted to avoid going to the doctor but I might have no choice. A couple days ago I was in a dentist's office and I read an article about CT scans in Men's Health. It was basically talking about how risky it is especially for young people because of how much radiation it gives off. I'm not sure what the doctor would order for me but I'm afraid of getting into a situation where I either have to refuse doctor's orders or get a scan and then have anxiety for the rest of my life about getting cancer from the radiation.,Anxiety

34099,Kind of freaking out now 'heavy' arm sweating. nausea I'm 26 years old male overweight 5' 10 250lb nonsmoker infrequent drinker non drug user sedentary lifestyler and my doctor has been monitoring my triglycerides for several years I'm a carb addict. For the last several days I've been feeling kind of off. I've had what I think feel like low blood sugar episodes lightheadedness feeling faint slight nauseaabdominal discomfort that got better after I had some candy. I've also had feelings of 'fuzziness' in my hands and feet that come and go throughout the last several days. Not pins and needles or even a 'static' feeling just 'fuzzy'.Today my left arm feels 'heavy'. That's the best way I can describe it. I seem to have normal strength in it and it's not numb anywhere just 'heavy'. It's worth noting that I sleep on my sides I switch sides several times throughout the night and due to the way I position my arms it's not uncommon for me to wake up with an arm asleep. Is it possible for a slepton arm to retain an odd feeling for several hours after waking up?Today I had my favorite meal mom's spaghetti. Once I got myself a serving though I found that I was lacking appetite. I began to feel kind of nauseous and began sweating. Nausea and sweating combined with the heavy arm freaked me out badly for a while. I took some peptobismol and don't really feel nauseous anymore I'm not sweating anymore but my arm still feels weird. I was pretty close to deciding to go to the ER for a little bit there but I don't know. I think I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for Monday. This sucks. I'm on Citalopram for anxiety that was discovered after I went to the ER with heart palptations chest discomfort and trouble breathing when I was 19. I'm kind of a hypochondriac. Why does it have to be my left arm that feels weird? I could probably ignore the right arm but since all the heart attack literature focuses on the left arm I'm freaking out. ,Anxiety

Im afraid of getting TSS because i read this horrifying ass thing about people getting it even without leaving in tampons too long or anything. And all this stuff about how horrible tampons are for you. And people were commenting under it about how someone they know even got it from pads and every other period product and it basically just strikes randomly. And people having to get their legs amputated of they didnt die already. And like if you have any open wounds or anything you can get it from that too. And basically just making it seem like youre gonna get it just by existing and having periods. Like what if i have some kind of injury from shaving or something i dont even know about?? Am i gonna get this illness just from having a period? Im an athlete and all too its really hard to use just pads apparently you can get it still anyways. I dont want to not shave or anything anytime around my period. I got it today and I dont know what to do i feel like im randomly just gonna get this disease. ,Anxiety

34032,2 years of relentless HIV anxiety please read and KEEP CALM For the last couple of years I have been utterly petrified of HIV. I'd say it has crossed my mind at least once an hour for the last 2 years and 4 months. Statistically the chances of me having it were alwaysridiculously small and none of the science would support the hypothesis that I had contracted HIV.But some brains work in funny ways. And mine is an example of a brain that immediately believes the worst possible outcome. And I'm sure there are many many many more out there who have wrapped themselves in a similar web of selfloathing and utter panic. The advent of Dr Google is good but it can also do some terrible things for our mental health.The solution the whole time was simple test. Test and set yourself free. It's hugely important on so many levels to know your HIV status. For your own health for your sexual partner's health. For the sake of the NHS. I am so glad I got tested. I can literally feel a part of my brain resuming activity. It feels strange not carrying around the fear I had been carrying before it has literally given me a headache as my brain tries to decide how to reallocate this space.I had ALL the symptoms. Absolutely text book seroconversion illness. Fever sore throat swollen glands night sweats stomach discomfort everything. Doctor's presumed it was glandular fever but tests never confirmed the presence of the EBV which it should for glandular fever. Classic ARS. Of course after a couple of weeks I was back on my feet again and the doctor was quite content.Then about a year after this I came out in a weird rash that wouldn't go away for like 2 weeks. Seemed like some sort of bacterial infection to me. And it always got worse in the sun. OBVIOUSLY my immune system was compromised.From the moment of my glandular fever my brain had convinced myself I was carrying HIV. But I wasn't brave enough to test. I was being cowardly. However over the last few months I've been having some stomach issues which are pretty nonspecific and the internet didn't really help me link it to HIV. The doctor did suggest a CBC test for me though I think just to get an idea if anything was going on bloodwise obviously lol. I was told by the nurse who carried out the blood test that it was very much a case of no news is good news.Of course having had the blood test on Monday first thing on Tuesday I got a call from the doctor. My white blood cell count was low and she wanted me to come in so she could feel my lymph nodes. AHHHHH! My brain went in to overdrive. I couldn't cope. This was it. My worst fears realised. Why me? Why me?!! That's exactly what HIV does it attacks white blood cells. Nooooo!I went in for the doctor's appointment and she said all my lymph nodes were normally and no cause for concern.She did then say I would like to test you for HIV. My world was crumbling inwards. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me a very conservative early twentys heterosexual male. I looked at the statistics to such a deep level that I knew that in my country of residence there was only 32 males aged 1524 who were HIV positive. That's essentially like 0 of the population. I was about to become a medical phenomenon.The doctor eventually decided just to take the CBC again in 6 weeks time and that we wouldn't test for HIV just yet as I kind of freaked out when she suggested the HIV test. But the time was now I needed to know. I would have no quality of life with this intense level of anxiety coursing through every fibre of my being every second of the day. I had a second job interview for a pretty plush job that day and I totally flunked it due to the unbearable mental tension I felt.I did manage to summon the courage to order a HIV home test kit which I had delivered to my family home where I would have the test in the presence of my family so that I could receive immediate support from those closest to me when the test returned a positive result and in my head it was very much of WHEN not IF. I spoke to them on the day the doctor said about my low WBC and they were all wonderfully supportive did have to speak to my Mum about my sexlife though not ideal.So I went home yesterday and I had the test. And of course it was a big fat NEGATIVE. Which it always has been. It was a crucifying 15 minutes waiting for the test to work but during those 15 minutes on a deep level I felt a sense of peace. The band aid had been ripped off and life was going to move on.HIV is the worst for health anxiety as almost everything can be linked back to it. The anxiety can make your brain question everything I was even questioning my ability to swallow at one point. But the chances are going off the plethora of statistics out there you don't have it whoever you are who is out there searching for every piece of HIV research ever which has been me for the last two years. But still if the anxiety is as stressful and overbearing as what I was experiencing you need to get tested. Now. Somehow. Make it happen.I took the time to write this in the hope that someone who is currently going through a similar thing to what I went through can find solace in it. You will be alright regardless. You are a good person. But you need to put your mind to rest. You need to have the test. 'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman teaches a brilliant lesson in terms of this. Our brains are desperate to come up with a story that will justify our irrational way of thinkingcatastrophising. But numbers matter. Statistics speak volumes. You are not special. You are overwhelmingly likely to be normal. You aren't the 1 in 100000 shot. You are the 99999 out of 100000 shot. Our brains struggle to compute the true values of these numbers but we must try. Peace!,Anxiety

34028,Cant tell if panic attack or allergic reaction. Please help. So I have what I think is the common cold and decided to take Mucinex DM. After I took it I noticed there werent any effects listed on the package at all so I looked it up online. Well it says the most severe side effect is chest tightnessdifficulty breathing. I was kinda already having chest tightness before I looked that up. Reading that made it even worse. The reason I cant tell if its panic or not is because I started getting bad anxiety after reading about the flu epidemic and how it caused death and stuff. This was all after taking it. This is also my first time ever taking Mucinex DM. Everything is just making my feelings worse and I dont know what to do. My main anxietypanic symptoms are chest tightness short breaths and nausea. It said on the website to go to the ER but Im too scared to and cant afford it at all. Im also worried its just my anxiety and that Ill end up going for no reason. ,Anxiety

I was laying on my bed noted my heart rate is 66 72 then I tried standing up real fast. It went from that to 120! then I waited a five minutes standing and it only went down to 108.So I tried again this time I sat down for 5 minutes my heart rate was 78. Stood up and it went to 102 waited 10 minutes this time and it was about the same maybe a little higher to 108.And none of this is walking around or anything didn't check that but no doubt it would be higher.Is this a cause for concern?

So I'm not sure when to give up and accept it's my healthy anxiety or if I should trust my gut and ask for more tests and exams. My doctors said I am too young for breast cancer 22 but it's still possible right? I don't know when to give up or if I should look into it more. What do you guys do?

34009,Bump on the forehead I have noticed that there is a bump its bone though not actual bump as when you bump your head against something on one side of my forehead. I can definitely see it looking from the profile. I havent ever really spent ages investigating my forehead shape but Im pretty sure it wasnt there always however I couldnt tell how long its been present either. Years ago I had a pretty bad head injury in an accident but I was overall ok and havent really had any problems since so Im guessing its probably not directly related if there is anything... As of recent I have developed strange little symptoms eg. I feel like Im clumsierless well coordinated than before and my muscles on one side feel a bit strangeachy sometimes but these things arent very consistent and arent really getting worse theyre probably in my head and they do get better with vitamin B.I know I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and after that accident years ago I was understandably pretty paranoid about anything headrelated thats why Im hesitant to actually speak to a doctor in case they think Im crazy and I waste their time on nonsense. If theres anyone on here who knows a bit about the subject any doctors or med students maybe do you reckon it is worth checking out? ,Anxiety

A few months ago I starving dehydrated anxious overworked uni student was sitting in my school before a class when suddenly this weird curvy shape appeared in my vision specifically in my left eye. Kinda like if you stare at a light too long and youre left with a retinal image for a bit except this was kinda flashing and obscured my vision. This weird episode lasted for about 30 mins and occurred again three weeks after that and again a week after that. Thanks to the internet and my mom who says she has a history of these in her past I self diagnosed myself with visual migraines which can present themselves with no pain as my episodes did. At the time I took this as a call from higher powers aka my brain? that I needed to get more sleep drink more water eat better etc. and I hadnt had an episode for two months.Well I just had another one of these episodes and although today happened to be a very bad eating day and I was super dehydrated Im starting to worry about these. What if I have a brain tumor? What if Im going blind? What if Im about to die? These are the questions pounding through my head right now. Any advice? Anyone have similar symptoms ever?,Anxiety

34165,Anxiety or genuine heart condition? For the past year or so I have had crippling health anxiety with it all being related to my heart. The anxiety comes in waves and is usually when I am on my own and not keeping myself busy. The symptoms are so raw and debilitating that I sometimes genuinely think I have a undiagnosed heart condition. Common symptoms include the following Floatingsinking chest feeling Sudden twinges and sharp pierces that go after 12 seconds Increase in heart rate Cold shivers Restlessness have to get up and walk around Panic attacks Strange tingling an aching that is always on the left side of chest and resonates to left arm and shoulder blade Dizzinesslightheadednesss I have recently taken up running as a form of exercise three times a week to aid in the alleviation of these symptoms. More often than not this gives miraculous results and I feel fantastic after every run. Occasionally however the anxiety kicks in half way through the run and it is a real struggle to continue. Afterwards I have to sit down and try not to panic and think that my heart is going to give out on me. Is there anything I can do to combat this anxiety? I am planning to get a blood test and ECG done just to rule out any conditions. I am a 22 yo male with no family history of heart conditions. I have lightly smoked on and off between the ages of 1821 but quit around 4 months ago. Any help would be appreciated ,Anxiety
34141,I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care amp doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you. and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better. I feel like I can prove myself to him from this point forward but I don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. Hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one.

I mean what else could that have been other than a brain tumor? Well that was ten years ago. Headache went away and there's no brain tumor!A persistent twitching in my eyelid and facial cheek that I thought was a sign of some terrible neurological disease. It went away. Occasionally it comes back and then goes away again. Tingling in my hands and thighs for several months that I thought for sure was a sign of MS. It just kind of went away over time. About 8 years ago. Noticing countless little red dots all over my body after reading that they were a sign of a type of Leukemia. Was convinced for 6 months that I had leukemia.

34053,Arm aches symptoms on one side of body Hey guys. I posted here before in mid December about having numbness and weakness on the right side of my body. I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break right after Christmas and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that Ive been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted albeit less severe Im still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.I just feel so stupid about this. Its following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing. Now Im stressing again but for some reason my mind doesnt want to attribute this to the stress and I keep worrying that its a horrible disease coming to claim my life. Anyone have any input on a situation like this?,Anxiety

34049,Where I'm now with depersonlizationderealization So its been 7 hard crushing months but im glad to say it's mainly over. However it wasent easy. If u haven't read about my subreddit about how to deal with depersonlization I highly recommend u check it out. If u r still dealing with derealization plz message me YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Trust me I'm the most paranoid kid I've been through hell and back with this. So near about OctoberNovember I thought about DP depersonlization less and less honeslty it's gotten so much better for me and i thank God for that. However I've not felt the same. Sometimes I feel like time is moving fast or that I'm in a simulation but that's just me being meeven my friend who has never taken weed or had DP is also thinking about these things. The good news is it does get better bad news is it takes time and motivation. I personally had to go to a psychiatrist about my problem however yall be fine without one. My thoughts took over me and i felt more depressed than depersonalised Don't get me wrong some days I thought I was dead like literally. For a solid 56 months or so I woke up everyday and it was the first thought on my mind it was shit I couldn't talk to my bro without thinking he and myself weren't real i honeslty felt suicidal. Then some day I just woke up and i didn't think about it don't know why just didnt. I learned to control my thoughts but not to block them out. It's like me saying QUICK DONT THINK ABOUT A DOG ON ICE boom bet u thought that fuckin magician I am. Anyway it's all about acknowledging your thoughts don't block them out or try to get rid of them however don't let them take over you. Say to yourself 'I know you're there I'm just not in the mood to talk right now' it's like a fly in the room the more you try get rid of it the worse you will exhaust yourself however if u see it u wait don't put your full attention on it and let it see it'self out.

33936,Hey guys. Please check this out. My heart goes out to all of you experiencing this. It is crippling and mental torture when it gets out of hand and it feels like it has so much control over you. The world definitely puts enough things out there to scare us but not enough to comfort us and assuage our fears. There is definitely a lack of balance and it's so frustrating because mental health is SO important. Anxiety can make you feel like you are going crazy and to me that is the scariest and most deeply troubling symptom. The feeling that I can't trust my mindmyself and that I've lost who I am completely and I'll never be the same. That's what fear and anxiety can do to you when not properly addressed! That being said after WEEKS of constantly and I mean CONSTANTLY searching on google for selfhelp I have FINALLY found a resource that is starting to help me. Most of the resources I've found only scratch the surface and are really tailored to mild anxiety they don't really help. I am only on the second module but this is the most helpful source I have found for this illness and I am hopeful that I will get better. Please please pleaseeeee at least look at this. Give it a chance and open your mind to the possibility that you can be okay again. Much love Helping Health Anxiety httpwww.cci.health.wa.gov.auresourcesinfopax.cfm?InfoID53 ,Anxiety

33906,Convinced I have lymphoma So I just turned 20 and I have myself totally convinced I have lymphoma. About two months ago I noticed a lymph node on the left side of my neck that was enlarged. Well it's still there. It doesn't hurt which I've read is more worrisome than painful ones it fluctuates in size throughout the day its not rock hard but it's not really soft and I can't really move it that much. I'm really worried that it's lymphoma I don't have any swollen lymph nodes under my arms groin or collarbone that I can tell. Nor do I have any other symptoms that are commonly associated with lymphoma but I know that a lot of people don't show any symptoms so it's not really reassuring. I don't have health insurance so I can't go to the doctor as I please. However I am trying to get into this affordable doctor near me within the next couple of weeks to ease my mind. I've been having panic attacks over it last night I had one and I was seriously about to go to the ER but my boyfriend talked me down. It's so exhausting. Edit Also I haven't had any infections or been sick to cause the swelling ,Anxiety
34036,I think School gave me social anxiety story is since I was born until I was 12 I was bullied no big deal because I am not traumatized and I am actually in good terms with my old classmates now but being bullied made me what people call a NEET I don't mind talking to people or going outside.... well I guess I do set some limits to myself when it comes to socializing to the point I am almost always quietI blame the school system at least on my country because it's made in a way that even when I moved to the US it just isn't easy to socialize with others because you have to be quiet or talk low this also gave me troubles with talking low usually it's hard for me not to well I scream a lot when I watch videos I am kind of crazy xd but in my comfort zone only and well I spent most of my days on a pc watching videos and having funMy parents also just don't know how to take care of a child you see I got depression and maybe something else thanks to my dad he isn't abusive he does things for a good purpose but the way he does it made me hard to tolerate him the slightest thing even just saying a bad joke if it comes from him it would make me mad over the line and I don't want to feel like that but I can't avoid it I dunno why it's just how he made me. I also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why I don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when I actually do want to they just don't let me I almost never go to my friends houses I had a friend who didn't care when I went but hey after 2 visits I couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective I don't hate them for that not even mad I just dislike how few chances I have of doing stuff like thatI think I am forgetting something.... I don't know.... I am not diagnosed with social anxiety nor seen anyone to tell me I have that but I dunno my man I am trying to explain my story but it's so badly structured that I just want to get to the point I am a NEET and I am used to live on the internet just chatting with people through text messagesbut today I tried VRChat and I just.... couldn't talk I wanted to but I couldn't most of the times I just think my voice isn't right for my words and a lot of times I just don't know I can't maybe I feel insecure? I just wonder if there's a way to fix this.... I don't think it's deepI don't feel pretty good now I was getting too bored in the game and I got tired of not doing a thing in VRChat my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without VR and it still gave me the chills to interact with them. I am frustrated because my voice... it isn't bad but I can't think of a avatar who would fit it my own appearance doesn't fit with my voice and even though I know many people have appearances that don't fit their voices my words my words are just what can't get out by just thinking how it will sound or saying it to listen to itThis is annoying I don't really hate my life I had fun when I was 10 and didn't have any friends just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game and I still had fun when I got friends on the internet or people to talk to ironically people ruined that fun a little bit xd at the price of making it more fun I am having fun now but now well I just handled depression I guess but talking to people is still something hard to do for me at least I got friends in my school but I am still just too quiet and I am annoyed by that I also find it almost impossible to start conversations or just impossible but without speaking.... meh it feels like there's no risk I dunno when I type I don't think I could mess up not because of my voice but it's still pretty hard but I think that's how it is usually hardI wanna add that my family aren't something I can call friends or people to talk to they have a lot of issues that are responsible for who I am now I also almost never talk to them specially when I just think there's nothing to talk about with most people actually but there's a fewer amount of topics with themAnd well that's my thing I just want to know if there's something I can do sorry for wasting your time this is a mess I don't normally make such a mess when I type stuff but this is one of the things I found the hardest to talk about not emotionally I usually make a mess when I find things hard to explain or to type but this one is just the worst xd oh wellat least I am not always like this there are times where I just have energy,Anxiety
33898,I might be losing my mind... Ive been suffering from health anxiety for around 6 months now. In the last 6 months Ive convinced myself Ive had pelvic inflammatory disease cervical cancer arthritis periodontitis and most recently lymphoma.I have a swollen lymph node on my neck that feels like two small lymph nodes stuck together Im worried they are matted which typically points to cancer. I noticed the lump about two weeks ago its maybe 1.5cm in size and moves when I press on it.Every day I bounce back and forth between anxiety and calmness.

She rarely skips work because she literally can't afford to miss work so I understand her need to come in I just don't know how to avoid her enough to not get sick. The day after you're done throwing up is not enough to not be contagious and we work in the same room.

33924,Could I have chronic appendicitis? Hello I found this subreddit yesterday and it kinda makes me feel good that I know I'm not alone. About 3 days ago I started to feel pain in my lower right abdomen. I only felt it when I was moving and coughing. Yesterday 2nd day of pain it started to hurt more about 610. Today it's better but i still feel it. I didn't feel any pain when I touched it but today I feel it a little even when it's better when movingcoughing. I am scared of what it could be. Do you think it's normal to feel this kind of constant pain for 3 days straight? Btw I was on 4 sets of antibiotics last 23 months I was even hospitalized because of 10kg weight loss but it was probably due to mononucleosis I had. All tests in hospital went fine.

34093,Help I was doing so well with my fears of colon cancer over the Christmas period. My symptoms were minimal and I finally truly believed I didnt have it. But now im scared I wont see another Christmas again. Ive been having slight feelings of being sick thin stools stomach ache and a sore anus on and off. I dont think Ive had blood but sometimes stools are darker than others. And I feel a pain slightly in my left side when I put pressure on it and Im convinced I have a lump there when no one else can feel anything. Im only 15 so Im told chances arent very likely. But my grandma had it at around 60 so thats what worries me. Around 23 weeks before I started worrying I had blood and urine tests due to another worry and I was completely clear of anything. But maybe that was too early to detect anything. Ive been in this state for like 6 months now. And its tearing my life apart not knowing whether or not Im gonna be here in a few months,Anxiety

I feel like I have a bit of nausea and the other day I had a bit of fever which only lasted one night. Also my left ear from times to times feel obstructed which I've been told is due to my nasal septum deviation.And I could list a lot of other stuff that's wrong with me but that would get too long.A little over a month ago I had blood tests which didn't show anything wrong beside some vitamin but everyday I find a new symptom and I'm getting really scared right now.

34005,Crippling fear Hey guys Im posting this because I want to see if Im the only one. My grandma passed on her hypochondria to me and ever since I suffered a spinal injury my sophomore year of highschool Ive been terrified of doctors visits and every little pain ache tingle and spasm I get in my body. I went to a sports specialist for my back and he diagnosed me with a C5 fracture and scoliosis. I can live with that. But after I became aware that my body is injured and no longer the same Ive been obsessed with the idea that I have cancer a brain tumor or MS. Usually its cancer that takes over my thoughts.My thing is I avoid the doctors office in every way possible. I HATE the idea of going to the doctor being diagnosed because to me my life is over at that point. I can usually talk myself through my panic episodes but I usually seek the reassurance of others. I have a mole on my back and Im convinced its changing so every other week I ask my girlfriend if its changed and she says of course not. I cant remember what it looked like as a kid but I couldve sworn it didnt look like it does now. My anxiety is so bad I went to the doctor when I had a flu that wouldnt go away got chest xrays to rule out pneumonia and before my doctor told me the results I told him look if I have cancer I dont want to know just dont tell me and he looked at me like I was crazy because the Xray came back perfectly fine just a common flu.Ive avoided the doctors office for so long now that I feel like there HAS to be something wrong. Terminal. I know I should go but even thinking about the idea makes me shutter with fear. A lot of the posts I read on here are about people that go to the doctor too much but I wanted to see if there were people out there that are like me.,Anxiety

34224,Swallowing air mostly when laying on my back Since the start of this year Ive had really weird symptoms. It started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. I got very scared because i was high on weed at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia I was sent into a fullblown panic attack. While being in a panic attack I first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. After sobering up I was back to normal. But stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so I had my next panic attack shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. At this point i quit smoking. Yet after that incident i noticed that whenever I laid down on my back and swallowedmostly the normal spitswallow reflex i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously I cannot control it. Ive also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. Now Ive become extremely aware of how i breathe how I swallow and when I feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. Ive thought about hiatus herniathe conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus GERDbut Ive never noticed any acidic reflux and so on... Its gotten so bad that some nights I cant even sleep because Im having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... Ive gone to three different doctors the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infectionor something like that idk the second one sent me to a therapist to whom Ill go to in march and the third one didnt find anything wtong with me just like the first one. Its extremely hard for me to live with this condition because wherever I searched Ive found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. Im using simeticon to relieve the bloating because Im not able to burp all of the air out. But I may add that I do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough Im not laying down. When I lay down on my back though it happens almost constant. I was wondering if anyone here has or had something similar to this? ,Anxiety

33909,Finally getting better. My anxiety was to a point where every few days I was posting in the sub and rAnxiety. I suspect my anxiety was worsened by being on antibiotics at pretty heavy doses destroying my gut bacteria and a hormone imbalance from going on and off of birth control after 5 years of being on it been off it for 3 months now. Noticed it was WAY worse in the week leading up to my period the week of and a week after. This cycle I actually only had anxiety during and before it was because I was flying huge fear of mine. Whatever imbalances I had I think they've finally begun to balance out.Now my only health fear at this moment is a DVT from the flight from LAX to Hawaii even though I know it's mostly from long haul flights and I obsessively made sure to move in my seat as much as possible... not to mention I was rather active during my stay in Hawaii. My left leg has some weird muscle twitches every so often but none of the other symptoms in fact the twitches aren't even a symptom. But damn I'm so much better than I was at my peak anxiety weeks. This year going to go to therapy and I've started exercising though I'm afraid my heart will give out despite being only 21 pretty healthy with a perfect EKG and no health issues and a former athlete my heart races bc I'm simply just out of shape... baby steps. What helped me a lot was writing down my instances of anxiety and working through them. It's called ABC therapy model used in CBT. httpimages.slideplayer.com206041594slidesslide10.jpgWhen I wrote down my current fixation such as a brain tumor I wrote down why I felt that way even symptoms! reasons why it's probably not likely had two physical brain checks docs said I was fine just head and neck tension and I didn't have any severe symptoms. Then I wrote how I felt after working through it.Pinpointing my anxiety to particular times such as my period helped me realize that it's really likelu just a hormonal thing and ya know every time I was about to be or on my period I probably didn't have cancer or a tumor or some horrible disease or ailment because I knew it was most likely just anxiety. I encourage you all to journal your anxiety! It helps you see trends it helps a ton to rationalize. ,Anxiety
34016,Second opinion for cancer? Hey there.I'm a 24 yo female and in early October 2017 I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck about the size of a pea. Assuming it was from a cold as I had been coughing quite a bit. I let it go until I noticed again in early November it had grown in size. I noticed another under my right jaw and my doctor ordered an ultrasound and the left one measured 1.88 cm x 0.92 cm x 0.98 cm and the right one measured 1.27cm x .76cm x 1.06cm. I had other swollen lymph nodes as well but this was the one I could feel from the outside.The ultrasound tech ordered another test through my GP although my GP was hesitant to sign the form for my follow up for early January so I went on the 2nd. The left lymph node is now 1.74cm x 1.03cm X1.0cm and the right lymph node is now 1.79cm x 0.91cm x 1.22cm.I've also found that my cough has gotten worse despite not having any other cold symptoms runny nose sneezing etc as well as I am finding myself very short of breath with a chronic pinchingsqueezing sensation below where my bra band sits. My doctor ordered a pulmonary function test and we are waiting for results. I find myself waking up in the middle of night really hot and sweaty and I have been getting an itchy rash on my stomach that comes and goes. When I mentioned this to my doctor she didn't think anything of it I thought I might be getting fevers at night from a bad flu or something.I'm a little worried because the lymph nodes mentioned as well as the other 8 or 9 notes in my ultrasound have seem to have grown in some way or another and I'm hoping my doctor doesn't dismiss it like she did the last time. Would you reccomend a second opinion? Seeing if the lymph nodes grow more? I would love some peace of mind on this.,Anxiety

34087,Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub but I really need to vent. I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However I live in Florida and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.Edit to add It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 19 days after infection so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.,Anxiety

They performed a colored MRI on me but I'm still worried because I don't fully understand what it's supposed to detect. If they were looking for like some sort of bowel thing would they have missed something like colon cancer or something serious? Does an MRI even detect stuff like that? They sent it to an outsourced radiology firm because they didn't have a radiologist onsite at night. The problem is my stomach still will NOT stop. It's acting up immensely. I've gotten over a lot of my health anxiety to the point where I've been off meds but I had to take a pill today to relax. My family does think something's wrong as I'm always fatigued pale nauseous etc. I'm getting a full blood work panel done soon because my iron was extremely low some time ago so they wanna check again also because diabetes runs in my family like crazy.Couple with an MRI and a full blood work panel this Wednesday what are the chances of them missing something?Thanks!lt3,Anxiety

46396,Diagnosed Borderline but having my diagnosis looked into. Recent letter mentions the word euthymic over and over after psych said it could of been Bipolar I didnt know how to write the title to explain my situation so here it goes..Ive had mental health issues since 14 been in the system since 17. Im now 32. Nan has Schizophrenia on my mothers side. Ive had two psychotic episodes and my clinical notes state psychotic disorder and borderline personality disorder. After being out of the system for several years. I seeked help again after some warning symptoms under a new team. Under the new team I requested that I had my diagnosis looked into again.Ive met with this new team a few times now but the most recent letter from the minutes of that meeting mention the word euthymic three times. The psych also stated during that meeting that my previous psychosis could of been bipolar. Ive researched the word euthymic and I can only find a correlation to Bipolar and no results on euthymia with Borderline. Im here because Id like some insight into what they may mean by this euthymic state. Well it says euthymic then later on in the mental state part it says euthymic reactive state. Please help shed some light on this Im clueless. Thanks and love to you all TLDR Psych letter mentions Im in a euthymic state 3 times but my diagnosis is Borderline however recent psych said my psychosis could of been bipolar,Bipolar
45593,Let's go cycling through Manicville...venting I just have to vent a little. I am suddenly in a phase where I cry at...every little thing. And in between crying I am drunk on manic energy. I love the creativity that my manic side allows me. I love being able to draw again and write. I am getting things done around the house and well you all know the story. It's just bittersweet because I know I have to see my therapist and stop this cycling before I do something really bad or go into a psychotic episode Its pretty devastating to my life when I do. I already emailed my therapist so I am trying to enjoy the energy for the last few hours while I can. It's like a drug isn't it? It can destroy your life but you still want it. IDK. Can anyone relate?? ,Bipolar

46345,Not Sleeping on New Meds I recently changed meds from Olanzapine to Vraylar because of side effect issues. I used to be on Seroquel until I got tardive dyskinesia. The past couple of weeks since I changed medications I've noticed that I feel on edge and wired for no reason. I fall asleep eventually but wake up 34 hours later feeling wide awake like someone gave me a shot of epinephrine. Minus feeling on edge my mood is more or less fine not up or down too much. Despite not really sleeping much I usually need 8 hours to feel human in the morning I am awake and fully functional during the day. Should I be worried that this is the start of a manic or more likely hypomanic episode or is this likely just me adjusting to my new medication? I am also on other meds that help stabilize my mood Lithium and Lamictal so this is an adjunct medication.,Bipolar
46188,Things dont feel quite real. I sometimes get into these fogs of feeling like my life isnt mine or that its all not real. I have a cold and my partner just handed me Nyquil to take before bed it felt like the pills crumbled or disintegrated in my hands for a split second Ive seenfelt this before in the car when I look at building or the road sometimes for a split second it looks like the buildings or the the world around me crumblesdisintegrates kind of like the movie Inception if that make sense. Ive been in a mixed episode for almost 5 months and keep get snip bits of this feeling. Last year my sister in law essentially took my personal experiences having Bipolar and claiming it as their own experience observed from their many behaviors this person shows symptoms of BPD and factitious disorder this kind of fucked with my head a bit. I am someone who constantly tries to make themselves feel guilty I obsess and try to convince myself my problems arent as bad as they seem because I dont want to come off as pretentious or as a victim recently I shared with extended in laws that I have bipolar in the context of the conversation we were having one of them was a social worker and I had a lovely conservation with her about it that made me feel open and comfortable. However in sharing this I feel like I am coming off as though Im victimizing myself or trying to gain sympathyeven though that wasnt my intention. This is making me feel like my experiences arent real and that Im just pretending to even though I know what my life has been from my memories but I keep questioning if they are real? I keep questioning if anything is real. And Im kind of terrified. It isnt that extreme but maybe it will get worse I dont know Im very confused... anyone ever experience this?,Bipolar
45445,Trying to get pregnant off my meds and falling apart. I need advice from bipolar moms please. Hi everyone. Like the title says I'm off my meds because I'm trying to get pregnant. I thought I could handle it but I'm cycling pretty bad right now. Luckily I'm not suicidal but it took everything I had to get out of bed this morning. In the past two weeks I've been delusional anxious depressed energetic. All over the place. I was diagnosed in 2011 and have been on meds consistantly ever since but my meds were deemed too risky for a pregnancy. Now that I'm in this emotional state I'm questioning my capability to be a mother in the first place. I babysat my 2 year old nephew yesterday and it took every last drop of my energy. I came home so drained I could barely move. I'm assuming it was also compounded with my current mental fluctuations. But it'll only be more of that if I do have kids. Is it possible to find a balance with kids? Will there be time for myself and time for them? Yes I will be getting back on my meds as soon as possible after the baby comes if the baby comes but will it be enough? I'm not even pregnant yet and I feel it might already be too much. I'm sorry for the word vomit I can barely think straight right now.I just want advice from other mothers. How did you do it? How did you survive being off your meds throughout your pregnancy?P.S. I do have an appointment with my therapist at the end of the month she's on vacation.,Bipolar
46121,Any bipolar moms here. Need reassurance. Im currently pregnant. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder unspecified because my mood swings are super quick. Ill go from manic to depressive in a few hours. Im currently what I call stable on 200mgs of lamictal but Im terrified of what may happen after I give birth. I know PPD with psychosis is higher risk in bipolar moms and Im scared because I want my baby more than Ive ever wanted anything and the thought of losing her or causing her harm scares me. Did anyone here either deal with PP psychosis or not have any issues at all after delivery? Ive already planned on staying with my mom while my fianc is at work once shes here so I wont be alone just in case and my doctor is aware of my situation and is planning to see me after shes here but its still a fear. ,Bipolar
46068,I'm not sure if I should go to the hospital Sorry in advance if this is kind of disjointed I admit I'm kind of having a hard time stringing a coherent sentence together right now. I'm trying to determine if I should go ahead and go to the hospital or wait until my psychiatrist appointment on the 19th. When I went on the last day of February they RX'd 25mg of Seroquel. I felt it was kind of low considering I was reporting hearing noises that weren't there children laughing lots of random noises turning to see things and they aren't there. My psychiatrist said maybe I was misinterpreting geese or other random noises but geese don't sound like young kids laughing imho. I'm mostly not wantingable to leave the house becaue I frequently feel like I'm being watchedpeople are video taping me outside. Since then I've also had two major episodes of dissociation that felt very extreme. I feel very anxious when I go places because I feel like I'm being watched but she said maybe it's just anxiety. I feel horrible most days and I can't sleep a lot of the time one night I got 3 hours. Today I actually feel much better still awful but in comparison it feels so much less worse. I don't feel suicidal but I'm at a loss for not being able to leave the house for months. I can't live forever like this and if it's 60 days between appointments and they give me medicine that wont' work every time I dunno what to do.I'm just not sure about the hospital I feel like I'm being dramatic and I'm not sick enough. Like today I don't feel as bad as I did Saturday so what if I'm getting better? even though I'm 90 not,Bipolar

45606,New diagnosis new medications Abilify and of course new questions Hi everyone! A little background here before I ask any questionsI've been struggling with mental health issues for approximately eight years now and I am twentyyearsold. I was officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2016 and started an antidepressant. It worked alright at the start but I continually seemed to be on some sort of a wave. Sometimes it was really really bad but then other times it seemed like everything was fine and I couldn't remember what it was like to be depressed.Over time this lead to me having more questionsconcerns and I spent some time doing research and combined with some family history this resulted in a personal hunch that I might have some form of bipolar disorder. I was pretty convinced I might have bipolar type II.In the past few weeks I finally found got enrolled with a Nurse Practitioner and I was able to talk about the crushing depression I was feeling. At first she decided I was experiencing severe depression and sent me for blood tests before she planned to increase my Wellbutrin prescription. However after my blood tests and talking some more she did further screening. Based on the questionnaires I filled out and what we talked about she and the doctor she works under confirmed that I have bipolar disorder. Despite the fact that I had been thinking about it it was still a shock and I'm trying to get myself oriented in this new world.Now about new medications... Originally I was going to be given lamotrigine 25mg twice daily but the nurse practitioner had to consult the doctor to figure out if I would stay on my Wellbutrin at the same time or if I needed to be weaned off Wellbutrin first. In the end they decided to keep me on Wellbutrin add Abilify once daily at night and if I reached the max dose of Abilify without optimal results then they would add lamotrigine or another mood stabilizer.So last week I started Abilify at the 2mg dose. I take it at approximately 1100pm and then go to bed. However I am having a tough time figuring out if my symptoms over the past few days are related if they're typical if they're likely to last etc.Disclaimer I know that you cannot provide medical advice nor do I want medical advice from strangers on the Internet! I will be telling my nurse practitioner everything when I see her next which will be on Wednesday of this week. I am just hoping to find some insight from other people who have taken Abilify and had similar experiences or who can provide additional reliable resources about Abilify because I am struggling to find this information myself. The nurse practitioner told me that they wanted me on Abilify to help me get better sleep. However I don't find it makes it easy to sleep at all. The first night I ended up being mostly awake until 730am and then slept until 1030am. The second night I was awake until 145am and slept until 1000am and I had similar patterns the rest of the nights so far. Last night I went to bed around 1100pm as usual and still was up until around 100am and woke up at 525am. I know that it takes a while for medications to really start working but is this at all normal? This is almost worse than my sleep lately before I started it. I keep feeling so so sick. The first day I got a little bit queasy but didn't think much of it until I woke up and couldn't get out of bed at first because I felt so sick. Over the weekend it made me so sick that I missed two shifts at work because I couldn't be bending over and lifting things up and walking around. I actually threw up once but that was it. I did some research online and ended up making the decision to try taking gravol with it but I know it can make me more drowsy and it's definitely causing dry mouth. I'm wondering if anyone else has taken Abilify and had this problem? Does it go away over time and only come back when changing doses? Last night specifically while I was trying to sleep I experienced something I don't think I ever have before. I think I had some auditory hallucinations I heard a repetitive noise and then it was almost like people were talking despite the fact that I was alone with my boyfriend who was sleeping soundly. I've never had them before and I don't understand where this would come from. Could it be from taking the Abilify? Or is it likely unrelated and coincidental?Thank you in advance to everyone who reads andor responds! ,Bipolar
46079,Looking for someone to discuss my experience Hi all!The past few months I've suspected more and more that I may have a mood disorder specifically bipolar or cyclothymia. I've noticed mood patterns in myself and also my mother strengthening my suspicion. I was just wondering if I could have a private conversation with anyone here and see if they have any insight. Obviously this is no replacement for a professional diagnosis or therapy. I'm just very curious about my situation and I don't see myself reaching out to a professional on my own will so I thought an external opinion may spark me to do so.

My job is sedentary office job but I have a standing desk which I've just recently started standing at after lunch break. I'm doing the whole Keto diet for a year and granted I haven't been a saint on it I've had cheat meals on weekends and little treats here and there also used to drink but have cut that out and used to smoke but quit that as well but for the most part have been keeping my carbs under 50g per day and ideally I want it to be at 25g or under. My caloric restriction is at 1425 I'm female 5'4 and last month I weighed myself at 147lbs. I started off last year being at 137lbs before working out 3x per day and before being switched around between many different antipsychoticsBipolar 2 which is MUCH more ideal and my goal weight is 125130lbs. I understand it's going to take time...but I'm becoming impatient. I religiously write down everything that goes into my mouth and count my macros. My weight has done nothing but go up and I understand muscle weighs more than fat but I have a pudgy stomach full face and I can't seem to go down in weight. I will be more than happy to provide a weekly macro sheet if that would help any of you but I'm desperate for any advice suggestions or just telling me to calm the fuck down and just be patient .

Almost two months ago I finally got my diagnosis after years of instability. Learning to live a different routined life has been a challenge. I wake up to a handful of medications and see a therapist now weekly. Most of it isn't a big deal. I've known about my mental health for as long as I can I can remember. Now it's coming out of the bipolar closet. My meds give me a rash on my chest that is extremely noticeable but they keep me stable. I am emotional and cry but I was so depressed that I hadn't cried in a year.I don't really know where I'm going with this. But what helps you? What calms your manic episodes?

So tldr I've been diagnosed for some 4 years unstable as hell for 3. A year and a half ago I started taking a concoction of depakote trileptal and clonazepam and it worked better than other things. I was suppressed and tired af all the time but could fight through it and improve and get stable. Now 40 days ago I stopped smoking. Ever since I did I've been so fatigued I can't do anything. I'm not depressed or sad or anything just tired. Has anyone else experienced something like meaning? Or conversely used smoking as a way to stay alert? ,Bipolar

But... if a human has 2000 thoughts a day I read that number somewhere recently that would mean Im being tormented with 1900 BULLSHIT THOUGHTS PER DAY... and ALL 1900 of those thoughts somehow some way point out to me that I should be dead. HOWEVER... sure all I can THINK about is being dead but goddamn it I also have to remember that Im not actually DOING anything towards it!! Keep remembering that!! ...but ya... That. Is. ALL. I. Can.

46397,Improving Physique and Body Confidence causing onset of some mania symptoms? Hey guys Im a 22 yo male in college and I have been lifting 6 days a week for a while now. I would say Im pretty built and over the last few weeks I have definitely been becoming more defined guess that happens when the holiday season and all the food that comes with it finishes haha. My body confidence is definitely improving and my attitude in general has become better because of it. The issue is the last time I really looked good it caused me to almost have too much confidence and for someone with bipolar I feel this could be an issue. The last time I crashed there were a lot more factors involved and I have learned a lot since. I do not drink alcohol anymore and I have cut back my marijuana usage substantially. I am currently eating a normal amount of food and getting enough sleep everyday. But Im noticing some possible signs of some type of mania coming if Im not careful. This means I will probably have to up my meds dealing with the mania but these meds often cause weight gain so taking more may take away a lot of what I have worked for exercisewise. I feel like Im stuck in that I have to make a choice between my mental and physical health along with my body confidence. I will obviously choose mental health if push comes to shove because I do not want to experience the same crash that I did last time but it just feels unfair. Has anyone had some type of experience with this? I have an appointment with my psychiatrist coming up and Im wondering what is best to say to her. Its just a really frustrating scenario I havent seen talked about before. Thank you for reading!,Bipolar
45663,Lamictal Pristiq Wellbutrin Bad Combination? Hey all First I am a male in my early 20s.I have been struggling to find the right mix of medication for me. I am not formally diagnosed with BP my doctor classified it as depression at the beginning.My experiences with medications began about five years ago. I originally started with small doses of Pristiq Desvenlafaxine and Wellbutrin Bupropion HCL XL. 50mg of Pristiq and 150mg of Bupropion. Still didn't feel 'right' so the doses got upped over the course of a year or two. I eventually was taking 450mg of Bupropion and 200mg of Pristiq.A year or so later my doctor added Lamictal Lamotrigene. Began at 50mg went to 100mg and eventually 200mg. At this same time my doctor decreased my dosage of Pristiq. I was taking 100mg Pristiq 450 mg Bupropion 200mg Lamictal. Lamictal seemingly helped the most out of all the drugs. I was not feeling extremely low ever i.e. hurt myself.Looking back it seems like a whole lot of medications...did I really need all that? I began to feel suppressed. While I didn't experience extreme lows their was not any highs either. It was just flatlined. My sex drive was also nonexistent. I am in my early 20sAfter speaking with my Dr. we decided to lower some of my doses. He briefly told me what lowering the doses of each of my medications would do and he gave me the liberty of experimenting a bit. I slowly trickled down to what I am currently on 25mg of Pristiq 150mg Bupropion 200mg Lamictal. I do not feel as emotionally suppressed as I once was nor do I feel extreme lows. Everything seems to be okay aside from a few things. I know that life isn't perfect and being 'happy' all the time isn't normal but I do feel like I am missing some happiness in my life. Another major issue is my sex drive. It is still completely ruined and it is beginning to affect my life and overall wellbeing.I guess my questions are Was taking all three of those medicines at high doses a bad thing? In other words is my doctor not giving good advice? Should I seek out a 'second opinion'? Are there any ways to combat the sexual side effects that you have successfully utilized? Should I consider talking with a doctor my current Dr. or a new one about changing things up if so do you have any personal experience that would lead you to suggest a specific change here?Thank you for all of the help! If I am missing something in my post or you need clarification please let me know.,Bipolar
45755,Time to kick the meds for a bit?? I want to stop taking my medication primarily lamictal.I want to my motivation back. My feelings it feels impossible to have an angry outburst now and I know that is not healthy. I feel so dumb but is it because of just smoking weed? I feel like THCCBD stabilizes my moods in a much better way. No matter what happens in the day or morning I feel ungodly restless until I smoke.I know it is entirely my fault for being like this a NEET but I don't know why I find it so damn hard now. Essential tasks feel so hard to do and I've felt dissociated for so long but I also feel like it might really the blurriness from Lamictal poor eyesight. I feel like what is up with me is more than BPII or anxiety. I genuinely feel that I may have aspergers or something. I don't know. Really I want to go back to myself a nice shy person who at least has a wave of motivation to chase my dreams. I want MOTIVATION and the ability TO DO.I dream of being an artist but now I feel such little emotion to express and really I don't care I just want to be able to MAKE STUFF.

45597,Mania Hypersexuality Relationship Mlehh... Ugh. I already typed like 3 paragraphs and it all disappeared. Anywho as indicated I'm experiencing my second manic episode in a four month period despite meds. I'm not complaining! But what I'm getting at is that I'd appreciate if you just bear with me. TIA.In my last manic episode I expressed my hypersexuality by posting in GoneWildessque subs. That's what I'm doing this time but also selling content and it's just not enough for me. I want to meet some of these people I encounter and it all just seems so RATIONAL in my head. Like not everyone is a serial killer right? The only problem I see is my boyfriend and that is obviously a bigger problem.Ah my boyfriend. He is amazing. I love him so much I just want MORE. Like I want to do the things I want to do and come out together at the end of this phase I'm going through. I've never had that kind of freedom before. I've steadily been in relationships for almost 10 years now and only been with two people in my life. So it seems fair to want to explore a bit doesn't it? But I don't think it's fair that I'd have to sacrifice my relationship to do so. Ugh.I really can't afford to be in this kind of a headspace. I'm starting college back up tomorrow and I love my life. I had a talk with my boyfriend though and he said once he is comfortable with what I'm already doing we can explore the idea of me having different experiences and such. So I wasn't shut down so that's good. But I started to spiral because he asked if it's something I would risk our relationship for.

45996,Starting to doubt I have bipolar? I'm a 26 year old woman. I was going through a really rough patch considering suicide etc. So I booked an appointment with a doctor. The doctor referred me to another doctor who discussed the possibility of having bipolar. At the time it made sense I could see how I fit many of the symptoms. In order to get a proper diagnosis I need to first speak w a psychiatrist. I have an appointment this Thursday. I'm now starting to seriously doubt that I have bipolar. I'm no longer feeling so down i actually feel fine. I'm starting to question whether I have bipolar or if I'm just being a little dramatic? Doesn't everyone do wild stuff now and again? My friends all have crazy stories of wild shit they've done. All similar to mine. And normal people feel down sometimes too. Right??I'm dreading going to this appointment on Thursday because I'm embarrassed to explain that there's nothing wrong with me I'm just dramatic and a bit of a cry baby. What should I do? Should I cancel or go and just apologise for wasting this doctors time?? Or could this all be in my head??? Help lol ,Bipolar

I need to go out party meet new people see something new! Im going to go on a bender. It starts with beer at a friends on a Friday night. Then a night out at the bar. Then Im begging people to drink with me on a Tuesday because Monday wasnt enough. I need more. So I disappear. No replying. No trace. The only think Im using my phone for is to call people I shouldnt and ask for things I shouldnt have. And then.. Im driving down the highway its beautiful and sunny . But I havent blinked in so long. My jaw hurts. Theres mysterious bruises on me. I dont know where Im going but theres no way Im going back. Because he doesnt love me no one does Im a piece of shit and they know it.

46161,There's no amount of meds I can take that will properly medicate my overwhelming generalized anxiety without screwing everything else up It just feels cosmically unfair that the fact that I need to take multiple mood stabilizers seems to mean the balance is such that it's impossible for SSRIs to lessen very much of my anxiety. I've been seeing my pdoc for years and she's great and I trust her and we spent two years figuring out the formula for my comorbid cocktail. Before I was diagnosed bipolar obvs life was miserable but I was able to take a higher dosage of the SSRI I still take Lexapro and maybe I'm remembering with rose colored shades but I feel like back then while my life may have been spiraling out of control the anxiety wasn't quite so paralyzing. We've tried multiple times to increase the Lexapro but every time I become catatonically emotionless within the week so I know at least for Lexapro that's not a viable option.My pdoc seems to think that the anxiety is more situational than chemical but I can't help but feel this isn't a normal or completely unmedicateable level of crippling anxiety to feel constantly. At the same time this isn't an ideal point in my life to go gambling with switching up my meds again. Is it really just impossible for some of us to find chemical relief from anxiety in a way that won't throw off the balance of the mood stabilizers? I know I should pursue DBT or CBT but makes that really difficult right now when I already pay my pdoc out of pocket and am broke as a joke. Is it pessimistic or deluded to think there's no way something other than medication could treat my anxiety the way meds did in the past? I know therapy could help with depression and such but what of the everysecondofeveryday anxiety that is definitely not entirely situational and has not improved with changing situational circumstances? If the anxiety was caused by something specific I might be more optimistic about CBTDBT but it's just... generalized. It doesn't go away.I feel my options are a. try another drug and start over so to speak or b. accept that this is my lot in life as a bipolar person.,Bipolar

46200,Help connecting with a friend Kindly direct me elsewhere if this is not an appropriate space to ask questions. I have a buddy of five years that our friend group and I are struggling to connect with. They are bipolar2 so they have their ups and downs over time. All around we enjoy their company they're a lot of fun to hang with but this past year they've become kind of withdrawn and even aggressive. They'll stress that they haven't spent time with anyone in a while but when we make plans they will either insist we have to do it some other time without even giving when they are available! or complain when they do spend time with us. I worry a lot about how much they've withdrawn I think it's taking a negative affect on their health however I've become frustrated with how they've been treating my friends and I. I want to be mindful in approaching this and supportive. Wondering how to help them get out more and perhaps also discuss how their communication has become off putting and discouraging.

46370,Depakote weed? I honestly haven't smoked weed since I started taking meds 125mg Depakote 3x day so I have no experience with mixing the two. Leading up to my diagnosis I was honestly smoking weed way too much and just kind of self medicating my problems in a way that wasn't particularly constructive with a lot of weed and alcohol. But okay that said I am capable of moderation I can do a glass of wine here or there without totally flying off the handle and I have done so while taking my Depakote with no noticeable differences and I was on a much higher dose at one point while doing so. What I haven't tried since meds is weed. This is not the type of question I feel comfortable asking a doctor since weed is still very very illegal where I live LOL and I am aware redditors can not dispense reliable medical advice and I am also aware that it is not allowed on this sub. Luckily I'm not looking for advice I'm looking for personal experiences. I am curious if anyone else has EXPERIENCE mixing depakote and weed? Did it make it more sedating? Did it make you paranoid or jittery? Was everything exactly the same? Is depakote and the occasional rare high any more dangerous than depakote and the occasional rare glass of wine or beer?,Bipolar

He loved attention and ate from your hand popped his head up every time he saw me. I loved him and was so attached. He died this fall I'd had him for 24 years. I was devastated.

46395,Hello concerned daughter here HelloI hope this isn't against the rules but I'm posting here hoping to find some advice and a little support. I'm f26 from Holland and my mom 55 has been in the psychiatric hospital for about 3 months now. Looking back I guess she already hit a manic state about 7 months back. The trigger seemed to be a renovation of the whole area that started in September 2018. She was constantly worried that I was going to be raped by the construction crew. At a certain I wasn't allowed to do any chores at home and she started treating me like I was 9 or something.Then she stopped taking her meds she offered her body to a friend even though she is disgusted by sex and started going on shopping sprees. She only got commited cuz she kept me up at night for a week straight which sorta forced her to seek help. Now she blames me for getting her commited. She also told me my stepdad doesn't want to have sex with me because I'm fat I have been diagnosed with cptsd because of past abuse of a familymember so this was extremely hurtful on multiple levels. She accused me trying to control her when I asked her why she didn't pay rent and suddenly my boyfriend is too dumb and autistic to function and she hates his guts.This isn't even half of the things she has done or said. I'm am tired and exhausted. She suddenly came home today late at night because she claims she is getting abused by the everyone and she left. I quickly packed a bag and left to go to my stepdads house she freaked out started yelling then asked her if I could forgive her.Here's the thinge I don't doubt it that she will get better. But I am constantly incredible angry and upset I have no patience anymore. I am constantly swinging between being scared she is going to hurt herself and just hoping that she does just so I can be done with all of this. I feel guilty and I am just drained of all my energy all the damn time.Is there anything I can do? Is there any advice you guys have for me when dealing with my mother? I don't want to hate her after all of this is done.P.s. I am already looking at other housing options and an inhouse therapist of my doctors clinic is helping me trying to get urgency to move. I am also in a lot of contact with the people from the mental facility my mom is commited in. School is also quite aware of what is going on I can always stay at my stepdads house who has never done anything weird to me ever and my boyfriend is an angel who is always ready to help me. I am exercising eating right and always try to get 8 hours of sleep.tldr mom is manic and borderline abusive driving me crazy. I don't want to hate her after all of this is done do you have any advice for me?,Bipolar

He gave me this medication called risperidone in 1mg tablet form. After reading lots of negative posts online about it I'm terrified to take this. Suppose to take it in the morning not sure if that cause it could interact with my Tramadol prescription that is taken at night as a sleep aid.

46099,Brief Mention of Self Harm How can I help my friend? I apologize if I am posting this in the wrong place please let me know and Ill move it!Ive had a friend M for quite a few years that suffers from bipolar disorder. M didnt tell me about it until a good couple years into the friendship they were in the midst of an episode and I not knowing what was really going on regrettably lashed out because I didnt understand why they had been constantly upset and irritable with me. After that we had a much better understanding and M did a great job of redirecting their anger so I wasnt getting the brunt of it. However theyve been under quite a bit of stress lately and although they are not usually directly lashing out at me theyve taken an emotional turn for the worse. M seems to be in a constant state of negativity always turning every small difference of opinion into an argument and going on angry rants about it. It feels like every time I talk about anything they always have a negative rebuttal. Theyve become very reclusive so we hardly ever go out anymore if I suggest events or concerts or outings they dont want to go and can only think about why itd be a bad time. If something goes wrong their nightmood is ruined for example if they didnt want pickles on their sandwich and got pickles rather than take them off M just throws it away doesnt eat and remains livid about the fact they didnt get to eat and eventually leaves for home early because theyre so upset. Our friend group usually gathers at my place so at this point its like Im trying to tip toe around broken glass in my own home lest I say something to upset them. Lastly the most worrisome thing to me is that they will sometimes joke about how they got so angry they punched their armlegbedroom walletc. and the damage is visible. They are currently on medication from what Ive witnessed mostly just helps more with the mania and see a psychiatrist pretty regularly but they dont see a therapist though theyve admitted they could probably benefit from one. I want to be a better friend to them but I myself struggle with depression and it makes that difficult at times. I guess Im asking for advice because I dont know how to approach a conversation about this behavior. My worst fear is that M will misunderstand my intentions. They are my best friend and Id do anything for them but the friendship is starting to take a mental toll on me as well. ,Bipolar
46047,Question Ive been very conflicted the last several days. I started Vraylar 5 days ago and have noticed since that Ive been feeling small charges of minor anxious energy and even more minor things happening during my sleep. Today I went further and got my usual Hypomania symptoms warmthpressure in chest random thoughts forgetting thoughts many ideas but it was still more minor than my last episode and lasted shortly under an hour. My last episode btw also seemed to include rapid cycling and maybe mixed states. I would cycle between HM normal or depression in one day or under a day and have symptoms of all 3 during HM. The previous episode which was my first a year ago wasnt like this. Sure I had the energy spikes here and there but it wasnt nearly as intense in symptoms and I didnt cycle between depression just crashed into it at the end. And boooyy that was my worst depressive episode yet.Anyhow after this recent episode I crashed into bad depression with suicidal thoughts then went baseline and have been that way till the last few days. My question is is the Vraylar causing hypomania or have I progressed into rapid cycling due to my illness being untreated for a year and the meds are helping it which is why its so minor? I know this is a lot but damn this is confusing and worrisome ,Bipolar
45615,Horrible day.. quit my job on the first day. Hey hows it going?Some stuff happened today and I really need an outlet right now or someone to talk to without judgement... My situation is as follows Im a guy 18 years old have been struggling with bipolar for years where the hospital seems to be my second home.. recently out of an abusive relationship where I impulsively chose to pick up and leave my home my family and my everything all of a sudden to move in with my ex 1000 kilometres away with her parents... thats the extent of how my mania gets along with episodes of psychosis.Recently Ive been looking for work and I found what I thought would be a great job at a health food store I aced the interview and trial then came the first day...I went in full of smiles and just my best to be positive as Ive been in a big low lately then all of a sudden I get there and Im handed the most ridiculous jobs and well all they would do is put me down and make me feel like Im absolute fckin trash. Now I dont know if its because of my arm which they all saw covered in scars or if it was because I chose to not go to college year 11 and 12 when theyre all university graduates or students.. I dont know but they were horrible and I was pretty much in tears for my whole lunch break.. Im a fragile bloke when Im going threw a low is all I can say.. Anyways I got home having a huge anxiety attack so stressed I could feel my impulsiveness and psychotic symptoms coming out.. so I sat down chain smoked till I couldnt breathe and sent my boss an email full of excuses trying to make myself sound normal about quitting after 1 day.. I had to quit I really did if I had thrown myself into that job it would of sent me right back to my lowest low.. the thing is while I got the job I was experiencing a manic episode where I talked myself up Beyond imagninable and asked for 40 hours a week knowing I couldnt handle it but thats just the kind of stuff I do...So thats my little rant of todays horrible events if you were able to actually read it all then well thank you and send me a message if you wanna chat..

45697,Experiences with Lamictal and hypomania? Experiences getting off Lamictal? Hi! This is my first time posting here. If I may do any of you have experiences with what I put in my title?Here's some not super necessary for answering my questions backgroundI have a diagnosis of Bipolar type 2. While for many reasons I still believe this to be accurate I've been questioning the role that Lamictal has played in my illness and diagnosis.While I had had many sort of hypohypomanic periods before and had actually been diagnosed before at age 13 my first full blown classically symptomatic hypomanic episode coincided with starting and then increasing my dose of Lamictal. This particular episode was used as a part of my diagnosis. I started Lamictal due to a severe upswing in my depression and history of not responding to antidepressants. The hypomania eventually faded back into my more typical depressions and general emotional static. This was then further complicated by the addition of other meds that I did not do well with at all. It's a bit of a tangle so attempting to determine if there's any sort of clear chain of cause and effect is difficult.I've never had any other side effects but I've also never really felt any steadier on Lamictal. Lithium is what eventually became a total godsend for me.All of this is to say that I don't know if Lamictal has actually done anything positive for me. Yet I've been kept on it ever since and I'm questioning if this is only because I haven't had any side effects to complain about. If this is true is there really any point to continuing to take it long term? If I don't have to spend the money every month and continue to risk the known short term and unknown long term side effects I'd rather not.So has anyone else experienced hypomania that coincided with starting or increasing Lamictal? Has anyone gone through getting off of it? What is the process of doing that like?I am of course not going to change anything without talking to my pdoc. I'd just like to hear from some other people with personal insight.Thank you!,Bipolar

Chemical restraints arent easing my anxiety either. So of course Im trying to put it out of my mind. That said my anxiety is so bad that my skin is tingling and Im nauseous.

I'm going to see my psychiatrist to see what she thinks but in the mean time I'd like to know of your experiences of mixed states. I feel hesitant because from what I've read my symptoms are a lot milder than what they were experiencing. Like I feel empty and it's hard to enjoy things but I also feel agitated and my mind jumps from idea to idea. I also feel very tired all the time but for some reason feel that I don't need to sleep. I have thoughts of feeling worthless and hating myself. Despite feeling empty all the time and feeling exhausted and that nothing brings me joy I get very creative and I have a bunch of ideas of all the things i want to do and feel like I have to do them. I also get frustrated and annoyed easily and feel talkative even though I think that people don't like me.

I am diagnosed BP1 mixed episodes rapid cycling PTSD and ADHD. The meds I took only made things worse so I stopped. I've been fighting symptoms unmedicated due to subconscious fear and denial.I had a psychotic episode last week that lasted a few days. At one point I recognized my delusions for what they were but the feelings didn't leave. I even had the presence of mind mind to mention inpatient. But I was too scared. So instead of taking it out on my husband verbally I internalized. I have so much self loathing that I felt I deserved to be hurt. To die. I didn't deserve my family. But I couldn't abandon them either. I love them and they should have so much better than me. In the past month or two I stopped taking care of myself. I feel so stressed. I force myself to eat once every other day. I haven't been showering or grooming in a while. Fighting addiction. Not sleeping. Car keeps breaking and I can't keep up with bills. I hate myself but want to change. Would you go to the new appointments or consider inpatient at this point? I have gotten a new job and I desperately want to excel there. What should I tell them? I will get stable. I hope I never experience a psychotic episode again.,Bipolar

Side notes Ive talked to my psychiatrist about it and she says to talk to my OBGYN but I know all he will do is put me on the pill.Currently I take 900mg lithium 20mg lexapro 3mg rexulti.,Bipolar
46292,An Eyeful. Obligatory Disclaimer Obviously I don't think that people with physical disabilities have easier lives than those with SMI per se. The thoughtprocess I'm describing is irrational by definition. I hope my post is taken in that spirit rather than delegitimizing a different kind of disability by implying it's a lesser one.Talking about bipolar disorder we focus on the trials and tribulations of hypo and manic episodes. Deservedly so as no other mental state perhaps carries quite the same potential for leaving a scorched earth in its wake. The depressive states aren't exactly a case of the sniffles though.Dealing with my own psychopathology I've come to fear depressive episodes more than I do the other side. Probably that's because I've only been fully manic a few times in my life and the choices I make now when hypomanic aren't quite as destructive as when I was younger. My depressive episodes are pretty profound though. Nearcatatonia deep. It's strange though because suicidal ideation isn't something I often feel when I'm down in the black. What I do feel and this has been a feature of my depression for years is a morbid fixation with my eyes.A bit of background I've always had a lot of trouble with my eyes. When I was a kid I had to do these weird exercises to correct a lazy eye. Then I had to start taking these prescription eyedrops because my tear ducts didn't produce enough lubrication. Later on I was diagnosed with Graves Disease and autoimmune disorder involving the thyroid and I started showing signs of developing Thyroid Eye Disease. I had surgery to correct that which was thankfully successful. However I became night blind and my eyes became absurdly lightsensitive. I can't drive at night now and if you see me during the day chances are good that I'm wearing sunglasses. Heh people make fun of me because I own a few extremely expensive designer sunglasses but fuck it. I figure if I'm going to be wearing something every day it may as well be wellmade and make me feel good.The thing is when I'm in a depressive state I'll begin having intrusive thoughts about my eyes. Specifically blinding myself. Putting sharp needles into my eyes. Using a pipette to put a drop of nitric acid onto them. Staring into the sun for hoursdays. Take a lesson from the Oedipal myth and pluck them out with my hands. Things like that.I've read literature regarding people who have strangely antagonistic ideas about certain body parts. In fact I remember a story about a woman whose psychologist gave her tips to blind herself and she did and is apparently much happier now.I don't think my eye thing is essentially a body dysmorphic thing the way it is for these other people. I've been trying to think of why that's the place my mind goes when in a depressive state but I haven't quite figured it out. I feel like I should figure it out as I feel that there's a strong nonzero possibility that I'll act on this at some point which is a pretty fucked up way to feel.My initial hypothesis is that I feel so sick inside and that some disabling external situation would... somehow validate the internal state? An ugly thought for sure.Is the desire to or fixation on maiming oneself something that others with bipolar disorder feel? Perhaps it's just an oddity of my presentation.,Bipolar
45990,ADD Inattentive and BiPolar II ... anyone else? Hi there I am 30 yo female who was diagnosed as ADD Inattentive in Highschool prescribed all those study candies and made it through college where I began binge drinking and smoking pot... also had a bout of serious depression and started Lexapro which lasted only about two years . I am very petite and was taking high doses of Vyvanse 70mg and also Adderall 30mg tab for studying. I had what I would call my first episode in college after smoking a bowl... fast forward to five years out of college and still taking Adderall and vyvanse and ambien gained about 40lbs. I wanted off of that shit so I quit taking it and quit seeing my doc. When I didnt have any left since I stopped seeing the doc I became addicted to Benadryl 3 at night just to sleep. Anyway I went on a trip and got some pot candy and I got sick and then I was prescribed a 10 mg prednisone. Thats when the mania started it was full blown mania for about 10 days before I went to the hospital. I dont remember everything but I was signing everything! I couldnt stop it was weird. Anyway sorry for the long post my new doc has me on Seraquel 200mg and vistiril along with a bunch of supplements I am trying to get away from big pharma. My problem is now I am still very distracted due to the inattentive ADD during work I dont work and Ill pick at split ends or google stuff thats irrelevant. My new doc said NO to stimulants and even said I should not drink coffee. He also said I can do pot or alcohol but it is disinhibiting so basically watch out. Now I am in a depressed state and I should be happy. My question to others is how do you deal with bipolar and inattentive add? Its a tough combo but I am trying to take things one day at a time. ,Bipolar
45765,Relationships coming and going with the cycles xpost from rbipolar First off this is a cross post from rbipolar and I hope thats allowed! If not please remove!Do any of you feel like your interest in relationships comes and goes with your mood swings? I am shit at maintaining romantic relationships. Its like my feelings for a person are completely out of my control. Ill start dating someone new usually when Im manic and Ill be borderline obsessed with them and then my depression hits and BAM time to dump them! Suddenly I dont care about them at all anymore and that scares me because of course theyre lovely people who have shared in great times with me. But suddenly I dont want anything to do with them get out of my life please thank you.I have managed to retain friendships with a few of these people but the others I pretty much just booted from my life and they were completely blindsighted and hurt. I feel awful for doing this but its like I cant stop and every time I date someone new I think maybe this time I wont do it.My friends and family dont take me seriously at all anymore. If I mention someone Im seeing they make comments like Yeah well see how long this one lasts haha. One friend even told me I should just stop dating altogether! I dont want to give up on having meaningful romantic relationships in my life! I am human. But I feel like a complete joke. It doesnt help that Im prone to rapid cycling so these relationships can be anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months. I go through long periods of staying single and having zero interest in romantic relationships usually when Im depressed but not exclusively Ive just never been very relationshiporiented but a huge part of my mania manifests as uncontrollable sexual appetite so I always end up dating around at that point.Its gotten to the point where I feel like I need a disclaimer when I enter into a new relationship! Ive tried gently telling people that Im a bit flighty but then theyre constantly waiting for me to leave and that doesnt really seem productive either. Im just tired of hurting people and repeating this cycle but I dont want to just give up on dating altogether. Anyone else? Am I alone here? None of my friends understand why Im like this and I feel I have nobody I can talk to about it.,Bipolar
45816,Bipolar II I just went through my third extreme manic phase ever Some background I was in and out of the ER in January four times within two weeks because of some undiagnosed pain I had mistaken for a ruptured appendix. I dont know if it was all the pain meds or weird sleep schedule or what but right after the last visit I was thrust into a manic phase I guess just a really major extended hypomania technically for the third time in my life. When I was young my bipolar II was misdiagnosed as depression because the hypomanic phases were not so pronounced and I was on Vyvanse for ADHD the same time as my antidepressants. It was about 3 weeks of minimal sleep maximum spending obnoxiousincoherent rants on social media questionable fashion choices etc. This morning I woke up and immediately could tell Im crashing. This is the hardest my depression has hit me in a really long time thanks to the contrast of the hypomania. I guess I just wanted to vent. I dont have a therapist anymore and my mom doesnt understand the depth of what manic phases are. She thinks its just not being tired and talking faster than usual.,Bipolar
45548,Trileptal Heads Up In very rare cases Trileptal can make your bone marrow stop functioning. I found that out the hard way over these last couple days.

45442,Do you give in or abstain during periods of hyper sexuality? When I'm having hypersexuality problems I tend to indulge my urges but I wonder if that can make it worseif I should try to ignore them. I'm not doing anything unsafe or irresponsible but I wonder if it increases those kinds of feelings if they are always being honored. If I should calm myself what tips do you have to do that? ,Bipolar
45997,How did the whole diagnosing process work ? Do you feel like it made your life better or worse ? Someone whose opinion I care about told me recently that he thinks I should go see someone and get medicated . It started kind of a big fight and at the time I was really angry because I didnt think he understood what was going on . I took some of the meds they would probably start me on when I was a teenager because of these seizures I was having and I told him I would literally rather die than take them again and feel the way they made me feel again . I hated being in a fog all the time not feeling anything at all ever the weird side effects . He tried telling me that I could tell them that and that it didnt have to be like that again but all I heard was youre being over dramatic and crazy . Which isnt really fair to him . Ive never been professionally diagnosed with anything ever but theres always been something not right . Its gotten worse the last few years more and more intense to the pint I dont even believe myself when I say I can handle it myself . I guess if Im being honest Im fucking terrified to even think about getting diagnosed and getting on meds . Im terrified of not being me anymore because even when I feel awful and like Im drowning in darkness I know that Im gonna get this high again and be ok . Im scared of getting told Im crazy . And Ive never admitted that before and now I feel more fucked up than before . ,Bipolar
45925,Is this bipolar? Im 30 yo and i just went to a psychiatrist for the first time. I have been wanting to go for years but felt like ive never had the time. There has been a lot of drastic change in my life for the past few years most of it for the better i think but lately its just getting harder to deal with all the emotions at once. What prompted me to finally make the appointment was that i had 3 one night stands in one week. Whenever i tell a friend this it seems like im bragging they say they dont see the problem. But the problem is i didnt feel like i could control my urges and i actually got seriously physically hurt because of it. I actually forgot to mention this episode to the doctor during the session. Still she prescribed me 25mg of Zoloft which im starting next week... i did some research and i think i may be mildly bipolar. But is to possible to get to 30 before needing to be diagnosed? Im starting medication next week. Not sure what to expect. ,Bipolar
45609,What happens if you take medication? I am going to be evaluated for bipolar disorder soon and if diagnosed will have to decide whether or not to take medication. What happens emotionally and intellectually if you take medicine for it?Im very afraid to take medication because I had a very bad experience at age 12. I was on antidepressants for two years 1113 and became a bit self absorbed and had serious impulse control problems. It ultimately led to suicide. Twice.,Bipolar

45846,How do I get my dad to stop spending money we don't have? My dad has BPD 1 and has always been super impulsive but it's getting even worse. I won't go into specifics but he is unemployed and spends majority of his time buying and reselling things online.The problem is that he doesn't have the money in the first place to be buying these things I just found out he has taken out 2 new credit cards this month alone just so he could charge them without going over the minimum. I've tried endlessly to talk to him and tell him this isn't normal or healthy but he considers it to be his occupation and will not listen. He is majorly in debt and if anything happens to him which wouldn't be surprising based on all of his health complications my family takes on all of his debt. I'm scared.What do I DO?,Bipolar
45647,Im falling deep into this hole.. After what I believe has been a 9 month of having an elevated mood... Im crashing so hard right now. I havent smoked in 7 years and here I am smoking again. I have no will to keep going. I cant stop all this destructive behavior. I want to OD so bad. I want to die. I want to sleep and not wake up. I dont know what to do anymore. Nothing seems to have a point. Theres no rhyme or reason in this life and I just want it to all stop.. I cant keep having this happen. Even when Im hypomanic I still hate myself when I realize how crazy I was being... my husband just sees it as me going through an episode again... just shrugs his shoulders and tells me it will get better. Its never going to get better. Im going to keep cycling through this shit all my life. Up and down and up and down. Fuck. ,Bipolar
45518,AMA Not ask me anything... against medical advice I took half my Latuda dose a couple days ago to see if it would give me more energy.

45640,Everybody asks this When do I go to the hospital? How many times have I seen people ask that question? I've counted all the pills in my treasure chest but not sure I like any of the potentially lethal combos. I've gone on the darknet markets to see what I can get but my drugs of choice are hard to come by. I'm not sold on more physically violent methods. I live alone so nobody would stop me.I've started writing a kind of philosophical paper to explain mostly to my parents why I think suicide is a reasonable option. I've drafted my will and had it witnessed. I've been writing my suicide letter in my head for weeks.Still if I do it it won't be tomorrow. Maybe I won't do it at all. Probably not.

45998,Throwaway can I vent for a moment? I'm currently undiagnosed getting there.. why does it take so long to see a pysch? but I had one of those oh shit I was so crazy I convinced myself I wasn't crazy moments a few months ago after I checked myself into a psychiatric hospital in the middle of the night while going through a month of full blown mania without really realizing what it actually was. I didn't want to get hospitalized so I kinda lied my way out Idk why. I probably shoulda gone but I just wanted to talk to someone and in the moment the idea of a hospital bed was the last thing I wanted. Feels fuckin bad man. I didn't ask for this shit. I really should have seen the signs earlier though. I was such a bright kid and then when I was like 16 I just dropped off the face of the earth. Or when I was 19 and I drank myself into a near coma and flipped my car 3 times and walked away without a scratch or that time I dropped out of college suddenly to become a plumber after sleeping 16 hours a day for months or when I was drinking myself into blackout daily just to cope with the pain. I am so very fortunate to have a wonderful girlfriend that cheers me up when I am down but sometimes she gets upset when im away. Sometime's I'm ice cold. I just check out from the world. Nothing gets in and nothing gets out. It's like an emotional hostage situation. It might be for a day it might be for a week but I'm just gone. I just get so wrapped up in all of my racing thoughts. They kill me. I suffered from some serious childhood abuse so I often flashback into those memories definitely have a ptsd diagnosis coming as well and then before I know it it's an hour later and my already shitty mood is just shot to oblivion. I am so. fucking. depressed. I've moved to a new city a year and a half ago and I don't have a single friend in my area besides roommatesgirlfriend. Honestly it scares me to talk to anyone I haven't known for years at this point. My desire to engage in friendships is shot. I would honestly rather fuck off in my room and work on my projects all day and night. Sometimes I feel like code is the only thing in this world that makes sense. It just is or it isn't. There's no grey. And that brings me to the next thing...Ever since I realized that there is actually something wrong with my head I have been lower than low. I pride myself in my mind and my work. I refuse to be limited. I just can't accept that for some months of the year when I'm low my critical thinking is shot. It makes me feel so fucking useless. And somehow despite all of this I am doing relatively well for myself. So there's that I guess. I do seriously wonder how long I'll be able to keep this up. I just can't really help but feel that there is just no fucking point to anything anymore besides my work. I don't feel as if I could ever possibly achieve happiness so I spend my time working towards some stupid never ending monetary goal. In mania I have a hard time discerning what is real. The one thing that I can understand is that money is the only god and with enough money you can do anything. So I pursue this because it is a constant providing stability above all else. If I could fuck off to some island with my girlfriend and enough booksa working computer I don't think I'd ever come back. I feel different. I'm losing my ability to blend in. I just act.. very eccentric to put it in a good way. And I feel like its becoming noticeable. I guess that's the end of my ramble. I feel embarrassed when I open up like this. Sometimes I find it hard to believe there are people just like me who are struggling just as much..... It's a lonely world.,Bipolar

46209,Addictions and how the heck to quit A little background about myself. My name is Michael. I am 28 years old and live in the USA. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 8 months but lord knows ive been bipolar all my life. I have 2 addictions they are video games and weed. They basically run my life. I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted they're functioning adults even though they smoke andor play video games. Some thoughts on this What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle you need help mentally like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something cool and fun so either way you go to your addiction your life force what keeps you here. Then because of this and through this you're addicted to something.ampx200BBut like so what? I'm just speaking out loud here but I love my addictions. I don't want to quit them. I play league of legends and smoke weed. I love doing it. Am I really happy while doing those two things? Deep down I know the answer is not really BUT AT LEAST I am not drowning in despair. My addictions keep me from going over the deep end they are what make life okay. Isn't it acceptable to use these things for my own benefit? ampx200BHowever this brings me to my next thought. Do I overuse them? I play league for like 7 hours a day on average. I smoke CONSTANTLY. I'm high right now as I type this. At work. Was late because I woke and toked played League for 2 hours THEN came to work. My boss isn't happy with me. My addictions are a hindrance to my life as you can see. ampx200BAre video games and weed ruining my life? Probably. Will I regret it someday? I already do and will probably continue to further regret they're use as I get older. But they're also saving me.Therefore I like any other addict out there don't know what to do. If I decide to quit. Will life be bleak and dull or will it refill itself with other things? Will I just find a new addiction? I heard it's impossible to quit addictions one has to REPLACE addictions. When I am drowning in bipolar which is often what do I use as a crutch instead of my addictions. I use video and games to ESCAPE! I escape from reality all the time because it is so vicious for me because I am bipolar. I see the world as hell everything is horrible because I am depressed. When I am in this place and I need to run away and can't use my addictions anymore what do I do? That is the time when I would relapse not knowing what to do but needing something to help me escape my problems. What about quitting addictions would improve my life?I look at this as a costbenefit ratio question. Simply put is the cost of quitting my addictions worth all the work it will be? I will be missing out 100 on the things that I love being League of Legends and marijuana and I will have to put in a lot of work finding new things to spend my life doing. And I probably wont find them as much fun as my addictions! Fuck that man why the hell should I quit? What makes it worth it? I can't find an answer man. ,Bipolar

46157,crosspost from advice I'm at a crossroads with career due to mental illness I'm 26 I do tier 1amp2 tech support and other IT tasks at a decently sized fortune company. I've been diagnosed with bipolar for 6 years. Anxiety and previously depression for 15I've been having one of the worst depressed episodes in years. We're going on 5 months now. Typically when I have an episode and I'm working the either the collateral damage from the mania or stagnancy from the depression lead to me losing my job. But with this one I have short term disability insurance and FMLA so my job is protected. I'm at home thinking about what I want to do with my life and if the life I lead could be contributing to the stress I feel. I went to high school for writing and was a college drop out for film. I have a passion for the arts a talent for the science and an interest in a lot of other fields. And surmountable debt from my previous studies.Part of me knows the reasonable thing would be to go back to work but it feels like a big ol wall is blocking me.The tricky thing is that the disease makes you feel like moving and making changes and starting new projects and idk if thats what that really is. I could use some outside insightI'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to go back to school and apply for disabilityscholarshipsect or continue down the technology path.,Bipolar

I cut my dose in half a little over a year ago because it was killing my immune system my body could barely fight a cold and I noticed a spike in my energy then.It's getting to the point where I'm really worried I've got chronic fatigue or something. I work from home and don't have any kids so it's not like I have a super hectic lifestyle or anything. I'm wondering if the lamotrigine might be contributing. Thoughts? Experiences?,Bipolar
46438,My meds are finally balanced but I cant stop vomiting! In November last year I was hospitalised after I stopped taking my Zoloft. Now I am back on it but am taking Zoloft in the morning and Lamictal and Latuda at night with dinner.

Has anybody else experienced this?,Bipolar
45403,Husband has just about blocked me out and refuses to deal with my mental health issues In some ways I can't blame him but I need someone. Right now I have a good friend to talk to but she really just doesn't get it. She never saw the bad years. My husband lived them.I have been married almost 12 years. I know that I've been working hard to act better and my actions have been consistently much more thought out and I've been MUCH less volatile. I can let things go that I would have never been able to before. The other night my really stressed out husband he went back to college and has just been grumpy the whole time flew off the handle at me. Over something I said about Mexican CocaCola. Anyway I just let him vent as he said things like You just make me want to hate you. And he referred to the last time I was in the hospital as the Smlybright show. making everything about me. He immediately referred to how selfish I am which I really haven't been in a long time. This isn't even really him! I least I hope he hasn't turned into this guy!I WAS selfish a long time ago. I was mean a long time ago I was way too hypersexual a long time ago. And he has dealt with all of it. But he can't ever forgive me for anything. He has stopped being there when I really need him because he has just started blocking me out. He doesn't want to deal with me. I cry in private. I contemplate leaving or dying in private. I can't talk to him about these things anymore because we've had this conversation 100 times and you never remember what I tell you anyway and I have my own problems to deal with and I know how you feel because I'm depressed and have problems with that and I still am moving forward because somebody has take care of this family we don't have kids. He means the pets. Which I definitely help with. We haven't had sex in about a year. For years prior I felt like he just did it to get his obligatory sex in for the quarter. When we got married we had sex all the time and then I wanted it all the time and he didn't anymore. Then he says he felt like I was using him. Maybe I was. I would actually throw fits about it. Crying screaming fits. Embarrassing but I'm being honest in this post.Medicine has made me gain a lot of weight. He says it's not me. It's that he needs to feel like I am a safe place mentally physically and emotionally. I still wonder if it's just my body. But I take my medicine because it works.He says I get worse every year but when I really look at myself I know I'm doing better in a lot of really important ways. My relationships with other people not so much my husband right now have improved tremendously. I am not working anymore well some part time but not a lot but I'm slowly becoming more productive and balancing my functionality with my anxiety and the pressure it makes me feel. I bring in the money because I was medically retired from the military.I think sometimes it's how you look at your illness. You can only really judge your own level of the illness affecting your life because you are the only one inside your brain. It's easy to forget the good times when we are feeling low. Last time I had some pretty bad depression I honestly couldn't think of any reason to keep going. I started to end things. But at the critical moment I just had this strong feeling that I was checking out FOREVER. No more good days OR bad days and that I could always off myself if I wanted to so I'd live another day and reevaluate later. And things got better. And then worse and then better. Any advice on any of this would be great. Sometimes I feel like I don't even like him anymore. A lot of times I feel like I love the old him but not this guy who at one time was always there and now refuses to deal with me.,Bipolar
45767,Newly Diagnosed and Drugged Hi there I was recently diagnosed with BP II. This is all very new to me. All my life my doctors bounced me around treatments for anxiety ADHD and depression without any real results. The worst of these was a doc in college who insisted I needed to take highdose Adderall which turned me into a 95 pound skeleton of a crackhead. Depression meds made me a zombie.My psychiatrist now is sort of working in conjunction with my therapist. I say sort of because after therapist sent me to psych for treatment for mood disorder he prescribed for ADHD. I wasn't really surprised but had tried to explain to him in office that I was a hot mess because I was travelling across the country the next day and that I was nervous because it was my first time meeting him. Of course I couldn't concentrate and was fidgety and talking fast. Anyway those meds made me feel awful so after taking them for a month I stopped. Yesterday he prescribed Lamictal and today is my first day taking it. What can I expect? how has it helped any of you? Were the side effects bad? I am also taking Trazodone given to me by my primary doc for sleep issues. Psych upped the dose of Trazodone to 100 mg and gave me a starter dose of 25 mg Lamictal to be increased over the next few weeks.,Bipolar

It's been over 3 years and I've gone through pretty much every med out there. Some work for a bit and then stop. Some I have horrible side effects. Right now I stopped Zyprexa about 2 weeks ago because I gained 15 pounds in two weeks and that's a deal breaker for me. So now I have no clue what I'm going to take. I have to be medicated or else bad things happen. Not really sure if anyone can help I'm just sort of ranting. ,Bipolar
46306,Hypomanic af if people only knew Long story short the drugstore that provides my prescription fucked it up and I took medication that triggered hypomania. Luckily its the weekend now and I can keep it simple. I slept 1.5 hrs the last two nights. My gf is concerned as I've been distant but really im just trying to shield her. I was supposed to hang out with people and cancelled bc of this shit and ppl are annoyed. I've shut myself in my room and will only allow my roommate who also has a mental illness to see me. I work out in the gym in my apartment building and return to my room. I get anxiety attacks and vomit my hypersexuality is out of control the voices want me to be destructive as a release I suppose. So I've been pouring myself out on reddit and doing lots of art. Fuck this is not easy. I am being vigilant these are the times I hurt myself and other people and make very bad decisions. My whole body is buzzing and the thoughts won't stop. I've been working out three times a day to try to tire myself out and shut my mind off. I've scrubbed every inch of the apartment. Vigorous cleaning and organizing is always a tipoff that I am in a hypomanic cycle. Going to do some yoga before bed. I keep telling myself its a process and it will take time before I can retrain my brain and body to continue to choose helpful coping. My body is so amped and my mind racing I want someone to tranquillize me and let me sleep for 100 years. Grateful this isn't my norm anymore. A sad and worn bean. Its fucked up because some friends tell me they are jealous of me bc of how I look and the attention I receive how social they perceive me to be but what the fuck is that worth when your brain hates you and wants you to die. Anyway I know this will pass ugh,Bipolar

45989,Been a bit hypomanic lately. Just went on a cleaning spree of the apartment now it is clean and organized. What's the best thing you have ever done while hypomanic? Been feeling hypomanic this week and today I went on a cleaning spree of my apartment.I rarely clean or organize anything so there was a lot that needed to be done. Granted my apartment is 400 square feet so there isn't a lot to clean but it felt really good to have it clean and organized. I still need to clean my desk but I think that's just a lost cause at this point. But the kitchen is spotless and a lot of the clutter has been dealt with. Sometimes hypomania isn't a bad thing! What's the best thing you've done while hypomanic? ,Bipolar
46186,Enjoy life with this one weird trick. Yes you are bipolaror maybe you are the SO of a bipolar person. Here is one trick that will make 2019 better than any other year has been.Quit your addictions.Whether it's video games Netflix gambling sex impulse shoppingquit the things that every other person in your life is telling you to cut back on.You know it is holding you back. You know you overindulge in it.I am writing this because I am the expert at overindulging. I've probably spent 10000 hours or more on video games. If something is stopping you from maintaining relationships and pursuing your goals get rid of it. Burn it at the stake and pour the ashes in the ocean.Life is what happens when we are busy making other plans. ,Bipolar
45733,Tell me your stories about weaning off Wellbutrin XL Because I feel so fucking depressed and suicidal. I'm currently on 150mg down from 300mg name brand. I've been on it 2.5years. I cannot go back up to 300mg.,Bipolar
46093,My friend is bipolar and suicidal asking for advice HeySo a few months ago a good friend of mine after a night of drinking told me had been planning to kill himself on April 8th but wasn't going to anymore. It is clear he was thinking about this when he was in a low state and he was definitely more manic at that point when we were talking. He has been starting to understand his own ebbs and flows. He texted me the other day after cancelling on me telling me that he was emotionally drained after this past weekend and needed some space. I've made sure he knows I care about him and I am here for him and have tried to be respectful of his space but also April 8th is this weekend and I know he is in a depressive state. My only slip up was I messaged him about a possible trip together but realized that might have been more overwhelming. I want to make sure I see him this weekend. It's going to be a rough weekend for me my great aunt passed away so her wake and funeral is this Saturday morning. I was thinking of messaging him Hey I'm sorry to be messaging you so much. I'm going to be home this weekend and it's kind of looks to be a rough one. It would be really good to see you. I'll be around Saturday night or Sunday if you could swing it.Do you think this will also be overwhelming? Should I just mention I'll be around and not my personal stuff that he might feel like he has to take on? I don't want to just show up at his house but I'm not above it. Would love your thoughts on how you would either best approach this or how you'd feel most comfortable in his shoes. Thanks lt3,Bipolar
45977,Your first honest realization I am bipolar I have bipolar depending on your preference This is what Ive been going through for the last several weeks. All the signs have been there since I first tried to kill myself at age 12. The mental health professionals declared it so when I was 15 in a lockdown but denial runs deep in my family. Anyhoot an official diagnosis will be coming soon Im 99.9 sure of it and 0.1 hopeful Im just an asshole. That said it would be nice to hear how other people felt or what was going on when they had their first honest realization about being bipolar be it before or after an official diagnosis. Thank you in advance this sub has been helpful. ,Bipolar
46042,Rant I Guess. Hello sorry this is my first time actually posting on Reddit so I'm feeling a little nervous but it's all good.I'm a freshman in college and last October I finally saw a psychiatrist after years of struggling and got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 GAD panic disorder and social anxiety. We decided to try lithium and two other anxiety meds. I actually overdosed on the anxiety meds although I was taking the amount I was told and was having a lot of pain for like a few weeks so I wasn't really able to focus in my classes I got pretty behind and almost left on med leave. I'm now on Gabapentin and got started on Lamotrigine.I guess the lithium was working for a while but lately I have felt like an absolute mess. I will be in what feels like hypomania in the morning and be running around talking a mile a minute everything and then just get hit with depression and withdraw from everyone. Or vice versa. And this sometimes happens multiple times a day. I'm starting to feel crazy and it is taking everything that I have to just barely function nevermind actually having time to do homework or other responsibilities. I don't know what to do with myself. I just feel so terrible. It just feels like I can't achieve any sort of sane moment because if I'm not being affected by my BD my anxiety is at a 10. I just want to be calm and stable. I am just afraid of this starting to affect my family and my boyfriend. He is the most understanding person I have ever met but I feel like eventually he is going to get exhausted with me. I'm not a very happy person and I don't understand why anyone would want to spend time with me.I don't know anyone around here with BD and it is making me feel really alone which is why I guess I decided to make this post. I just feel so crazy I don't know. I'm sorry. ,Bipolar
46109,What personality traits do you associate with being Bipolar or Bipolar 2? At the age of 47 Ive just been given a diagnosis of Bipolar 2. Im looking back through my life and wondering what aspects of myself are related and which arent. Ive listed the ones I can think of below very interested to see who can relate or what peoples differences might be. indecisive about what career direction to take Been a teacher website manager aged carer Rehab counsellor and counting. Artisticcreativecrafty Love the planningideas phase of projects but find the execution becomes boring and I dont finish off Get inspired and enthusiastic about one topic or activity for a while thinking about it a lot engage in it almost in an obsessive manner but often without finishing projects talk about it to other people ... and then suddenly lose interest. Intimate relationships are topsyturvy Ive been with my SO for 20 years now but many times in our relationship Ive had one foot in and one foot out feel sure and committed then feel like Im with the wrong person ... marriage is needless to say very precarious atm because I have hurt my SO so much ,Bipolar
46153,I am confused with potential diagnosis am I actually fine? So the last couple of weeks for around 8 days I felt horrendous I wanted to die so badly I couldnt find a way out. That was just after I had been overly happy cleaned everything started volunteering for a charity and was feeling productive and somewhat irritated this lasted around 4 days. Now this week or more so right now I feel flat and annoyed with everyone I feel as if Im fine and normal Im not worried about passing my exams because I feel okay but flat Ive been like this for 2 days now. I went to the doctor after years of feeling unstable recently and now today I feel as if Ive been dramatic by going to the doctor they said it sounds like I may have bipolar and I am waiting for a further mental health assessment.Many people around me tell me they think Ive got bipolar but I truly think Ive messed up by going to the doctor in the first place and actually everything is fine.When I am not feeling okay I know that actually I am unwell but I feel fine now and I dont want to talk to any other professionals about this potential bipolar diagnosis when I am fine and feeling as if this is just who I am. Sometimes Im a bubbly funny person sometimes I am very low now Ive had a professional say its potential bipolar I am in total denial of anything being wrong. I feel irritated. Can anyone relate? TLDR I was so sure I was unwell but now Ive finally spoken to someone I think Im fine and I was being dramatic. ,Bipolar

46178,I don't think I am ready to go back to work. I used to be diagnosed with bipolar but it turns out I'm not. This however is the most helpful mental health sub so I'm going to post it here.I have very severe depression. I have been hospitalized twice last time was two weeks in February. I get SSDI.I am not good at understanding myself and I told vocational rehabilitation I was ready to go back with my Ticket to Work. I'm not ready. I'm an idiot. What do I do? I have a meeting scheduled with a job developer at the end of the month who is going to help me get in the work force.,Bipolar
45479,Catastrophic anxiety panic anyone? Anxiety in itself isnt new for me but this is next level.From my own mortality to the plane Im flying on crashinghijacked to the car crashing and bursting into flames with my children inside while only I escape to terrorist attacks in a city McDonalds... its becoming a huge problem. I get so carried away in the thought of whatever scenario I am picturing that I get to high panic really easily and I cant talk myself down easily and hit a benzo as needed. Im going overseas in 6 months and the I cant go. This will happen has already started. Anyone else? Fuck this. I havent had this in my life for over 10 years and have no idea how I got over it back then. Am in therapy dont have an appointment for another month,Bipolar
45945,Changing med times I take quetiapine every night at around 10 pm. I missed a dose last night because silly me forgot to pick up my repeat prescription so I'm running on 0hrs sleep.

45636,contemplation I'm sitting here in my trailer I'm living at a ski resort at the moment for my job. It should be my dream job but I feel so empty and alone.. even when I'm with people. I have been manic for the past 6 months and it was beautiful except for the intermittent psychosis ofc. But fuck I want to be psychotic.. it's certainly better than this. I've just taken an oxycodone adderall.. drinking a beer.. I cut again night before last and i've even found my non dull razors.. I feel nothing and yet everything at the same time.. I feel so fucking dramatic right now but I figured if anyone could understand it would be other people like me. Idk why I think being psychotic would be better than this but I guess it's because im confident. My hallucinations and delusions ARE real... I dont feel real right now. I feel like a bag of bones hence why I want to cut into it. idk what to fucking do but is anyone else struggling to keep their grip on reality.. but secretly just wants to fall headfirst into it. I hate my illness but the symptoms and coping skills albeit harmful and self destructive i've come to know and love over the years of having this illness just seem so appealing and comforting to me rn. thanks for your time. ,Bipolar
46035,I'll be without lithium until monday and other concerns I haven't had lithium for roughly 33 hours. I talked to my nurse at my psychiatrists and he said I should probably just feel irritable and offkilter idk what this means? until monday until I get my meds prescribed. Are there any other side effects I should be on the look out for?However doing research I found out about how toxic lithium can be to your kidneys and thyroid and whatnot. Lithium works unbelievably well for me my moods are completely stable on lithium. How likely are these horrible side effects and I realize I should talk to my psych about this i see him tuesday but does anyone have any advice on this? Should I stick with lithium or try something else? Does anyone have any personal experience with lithium fucking them over medically?,Bipolar
45590,Fast Cycling I've been experiencing extreme mood swings in a single day. I thought it was a hormone problem but a friend said it could be from my bipolar diagnosis. I haven't mentioned it to my psychiatrist because i didn't think it was related since I had never heard about that being a symptom before. I've definitely never met someone else who has described the same thing. I'm taking lamictal but I can't tell it working other than not being in a depression for months at a time anymore. Does anyone else here experience this?,Bipolar
45508,This isnt related to bipolar but I need to talk to someone and everyone here is asleep. Mice in my room tw eating disorder Not sure if this can go here.I have an eating problem and I binge eat a lot and I keep the food wrappers in my room because I am embarrassed and dont want my parents to find out about the binging...Woke up at 4am and saw a mouse on my bedroom floor and there is always more than one. Must have been attracted by the food wrappers. Told my parents and they are angry but I told them it was wrappers from Christmas chocolate not binge food. Ill die of embarrassment if they find out which they will because all the wrappers are in a bin bag in my room. So the mice are going to be horribly killed and my parents are going to be so angry with me and it is all my fault and I feel so guilty. This happened when I was around fourteen for the same reason I am now 22 and oh god why the hell havent I grown out of this pathetic crap. I dont know what to do I mean short term the mouse need sorting out. I am in my brothers room tonight now too scared to go into mine and I think I can hear them in the loft. Its an old house. I am so scared that they are all through the house. The thought of them living in my room makes me feel a bit sick when I was fourteen we put out traps and one died in front of me and I swore I would change my ways and grow up a bit but now I am a fucking adult and I still am like this and my parents are going to be so disappointed Oh god. Been hearing noises for about a week but told myself it was the radiator making the papers move on my noticeboard although looking back it was mice and I was lying to myself. I can definitely hear them in the loft above my head. I feel so bad ,Bipolar
46006,Advice?? Does anyone have any advice on how to approach a doctor about a possible misdiagnosis? Andor what to expect if I do? I'm starting to think that the initial diagnosis of BD might actually be BPD. I've cross referenced the two and am starting to doubt. I'm currently medicated for BD and I'm not sure if I would need all the medications I'm on. I don't want to screw up the balance I have but I also don't want to live with the side effects of certain meds if I don't have to. ,Bipolar

45871,I'm just not sure anymore Ive been subscribed to Bipolar Reddit for a couple of years now but this is the first time I've posted. I realized that I felt different from everyone around 14 or 15 years old and got a full diagnoses at 21. I take 10mg Trintellix every day to help stabilize I have Bipolar II. I'm 24 years old. I use to be so sure of myself and now I just don't know anymore. I thought I was on the right track but when I begin to reflect I realize I feel I lost my way.I have a stable job I'm in college I have a girlfriend who lives with me and I'm sober for the most part no more hard drugs. I just feel so lost to the wind. I feel like I've let control go to life. Like I'm a plastic sack blowing around aimlessly. I feel like the things around me control my life more than I do.I know this is gonna just get buried in this sub but I needed to vent. I feel like I do everything the way I'm supposed to do but it just isn't enough. The best thing I've ever done or most perfect isn't good enough. Not for me or anyone else. I can't afford therapy plus I live in eastern Texas so therapy isn't very extensive in my area.I want to quit but I know I'm way to strong of a human being to do that. I only want to feel like I'm on the right track. I want to feel like I'm doing the right thing. I feel like I am sad but I can't exhibit the emotion. I just feel frustrated anxious and blank. I don't know what I want from posting this other than some else to try to understand because everyone else around me seems to not have a grasp on what I feel or I'm going through. I love you all that are going through anything difficult right now. Please know that you aren't alone. I suffer just like you. I'd love to talk to you if you'd like to talk. Just never give up because you aren't the only one. This sub has taught me I'm not alone. Thank you if you've made it this far. I just want to feel connected.,Bipolar
46435,I don't know how to explain this. Maybe I just need to rant. I've been sober for a year and 3 months. I take my meds everyday without fail. I eat pretty good and try to get outside as much as I can even though I'm a shut in agoraphobic. I go to therapy. My problems are dealt with my stressors are at a minimum.Why the fuck am I depressed? Why the fuck can't I sleep? Seriously it's almost 8am and now my schedule is completely out the window. I'm not even hypomanic I don't have any energy. I've been laying here watching YouTube eating left over pizza just kind of doing nothing. I'm so pissed.The worst part is there's a cycle! An actual honest to god cycle. Not just a bipolar cycle where triggers set things off. No no no. This is a biological cycle. You see I have PCOS. And every time I've gotten my period since I was 9 years old it's made me depressed moody bitchy argumentative etc. A lot of the time I start to think this is all from my hormones and I don't even have bipolar. I'd be even more convinced if my lithium didn't work great within 2 days of my first time taking it and it didn't run rampant in my family. Alas I have the family curse.But seriously having PCOS is a fucking curse too. I use the app Clue to track my cycle and I just checked it tonight to see where I'm at and realized why I was being such a cunt to my fiance all weekend and never wanted to leave the apartment. Why I keep falling asleep later and later in the morning everyday and can't get out of bed until the late afternoon. I'm fucking 25 years old! This is so stupid. I haven't been able to have a job in years because of this and I've never gotten any kind of relief from any doctor.Those fake sun lamps don't help. Melatonin doesn't do shit. Sleeping pills make me hallucinate. I've been checked for any type of vitamin deficiencies. I try to fix my schedule at least once a month where I won't sleep for like 30 hours. It's ridiculous it's the same shit all year every year.I'm so sorry if this isn't really a bipolar post I think it is because I feel like my cycle effects my bipolar so much that this happens every month. But I could be wrong maybe it's just all the hormones and my bipolar is completely fine.I wish I had an answer. I wish I could find a solution.,Bipolar
45675,Success or hypomania? Regardless things are FINALLY looking up. Today my psychiatrist released me! She saved my life several times and I saw her for 5 years but now I'm moving across the country and will need to find someone new. I thought she was going to change my medicine but she said I seemed too stable to make any changes with the move coming up and her not being able to observe me face to face anymore. Wow that felt good to not need to add another Med. She emphasized my progress and that I should find a doctor in my new area within the next three months but that she considered our time together a success because I became more and more stable as time went on. I walked out of that appointment on air. Feeling great. Feeling GREAT. Walked right into a tattoo parlor and spontaneously got another piercing. Next door was a record store so I spent 100 on vinyl. I'm hoping I'm just treating myself instead of ramping up to hypomania. I finally graduated college in December after a whole year of stability and things are truly looking up for me for the first time since 2011. Just wanted to stop in to brag a little bit sorry but mostly remind you beautiful humans that stability and success are possible! Just keep trucking! I'm so glad I didn't give up and end my life before the good part started. Love and light to all of you. Thanks for your support along the way I love this community. ,Bipolar
45575,Pre shift anxiety so I work for a starbucks inside albertsons. I've been here for about a month and everything has been going okay. But I've found that I always without fail get anxious about the day ahead of me I've been this way since I got my first job 4 years ago. Once I go to work I'm 90 better but it starts again the next day. You would think that if you had a good day then it would disprove all the worries you've had but there's always the thought of today was good but tomorrow could just as easily be terrible. I know many of you deal with this as well but I just felt like ranting to people who would actually understand me after all misery loves company.I'm about to go into work and I'm dreading every tick of the clock.

46235,Bipolar documentary and how it made me feel I just finished watching a documentary about Mauro Ranallo called Bipolar Rock N Roller. For anyone who doesnt know Mauro is an insanely successful playbyplay announcer and has called some of the biggest fights in boxing kickboxing MMA and professional wrestling. The documentary is a brutally honest look at his life and struggles with bipolar disorder.I also work in broadcasting radio and the documentary hit me pretty hard. Hearing him talk about everything and seeing the things hes gone through and still goes through was a little weird for me because I kept saying over and over Thats me. I do that. That happens to me too. It was a relief in a way because it was a reminder that Im not the only one but it was also uncomfortable to watch at times because I felt like I was watching myself. I cant tell if I feel better or worse after seeing it. Has anyone else ever watched something like this and felt that way? Has a movie or documentary about bipolar disorder ever made you uncomfortable or even triggered an episode? Also does anyone have any recommendations for similar documentaries or specials? Thanks. ,Bipolar
45397,What birth control are you on? I tried an IUD but it came out after a traumatic assault. I was taking microgestion but even at the lowest dose of hormones I had a bad reaction. Yet some how depo provera doesn't affect my mood but I absolutely hate not having my period. Huff. I hate condoms I don't even trust them. I'm on the fence about getting fixed not even sure Medicaid would cover it anyway. What's a girl to do? If it matters any I was not on any birth control after getting on lamictal which is my only script and I've been doing amazingly well on it. ,Bipolar
45626,Mania I often see people on hereother mental health subreddits expressing happiness when they say they were manic or had a manic episode. But I hate it. My mania is the thing that makes me want to get a knife out and slide across my neck. I have no control over myself. I develop tremors and can't stop moving. I want to smash things. Get a hammer and put holes in my walls and through the windshield of my car. I can't even set down to write a whole email. I'll type a few words then go and walk or spas out then come back and do it all again. I've gotten manic while driving before or felt it come on and one of the only things that helps at the time is to stick a knife in my leg. Not inside my leg but just putting the tip on my flesh and putting just enough pressure to focus on the pain instead of mania.I have an anxiety med that works to help Klonopin but taking my max dosage doesn't always help. my max is 4mg but I've taken up to 20mg before. When I'm manic is the time when I cry the most. Thank you for reading my rant. I apologize if it's a bit of a ramble in some parts. Hopefully it's clear enough though.,Bipolar
45711,How to convince someone that I'll be okay? I've spent my entire life managing my ups and downs. I've figured out strategies for waiting out the lows and have handled it myself for as long as I can remember. It's made school difficult at times but I've done my best to keep my shit together and I'm in a graduate program that I absolutely love and working with people who are amazing. I know how to meet deadlines even in my worst episodes and I've learned how to harness the very rare hypomania for productivity. I accidentally confided in my supervisor and told him that I was dealing with a particularly bad bout of depression not my worst though. This spiralled into him being excessively worried about me and reaching out to other people and him phoningtexting me to check up on me. I've had moderate suicidal thoughts in past but I can usually handle them or I know to go to a doctor immediately if not. I was emotionally exhausted but doing okay before he started worrying about me. I'm afraid that his concern is pushing me deeper into this depressive episode though because he's made it feel more serious than usual. He was worried I was suicidal and that made me think about suicide more than usual and freak myself out about it. I ended up on the phone with him at 2AM crying because of it...The thing is I know it passes. I deal with it all the time. I know my worstcase measures and I'm prepared to use them. But the crucial thing is that I've always dealt with it myself. On one hand I get where he is coming from on the you shouldn't have to go through this alone thing but the fact that he's referring to me as a student in crisis makes me scared and makes me feel more fucked updepressed. I'm not sure how I can convince him that I'll be okay. I'm also worried that I've fucked up the only good thing in my life my academic stuff by confiding in him. I've resolved to take the steps he wants talking to X person checking in etc. to show that I'm committed to livingdealing with this shit and that I am accepting his help but it's so difficult when I just want to make an appointment with my psychiatrist and deal with this in my own way without everyone knowing. Also I feel like shit for making him worry and also for ruining his perception of me.Does anyone have any recommendations for quelling his worry and coming back from this gracefully?edit just fyi bipolar type II on bupropion and carbamazepine ,Bipolar
46453,Dear husband losing you is too high stakes Lately I've managed to break down a ton of walls. I've managed to get to a better stable place with my husband. I love him more every day and I am so fortunate to have him as my number one. However lately I've just been realizing that he as my number one support is also my life support. In other communities on Reddit people would urge me to be more selfsufficient independent but I think you guys know what I mean and if you have found your person you might relate. I'm so scared of him dying that I can't let him get any closer. I feel like this is the final hurdle of a really wonderful marriage but I'm just so fucking scared. The world without him is unimaginable and horrifying. So classic me I won't let it be no holds barred. I still hold back just a little back in case he dies.I know I sound ridiculous. ,Bipolar

46032,Lurker realizing I need some help copingunderstanding depressive episode relapse. I guess for some preface I was diagnosed last year but have had it all my life. I'm type 1 but was pretty functional as I typically used what I now realize is my mania in school and etc. and pretty much was excelling despite going through manic and depressive episodes thinking it was normalteenage angst etc. until about my 4th year in college when things went down south fast. Fast forward two years a couple of hospital visits and finally getting a full wrap around team I'm a lot more stable now that I'm on what I feel are the right set of meds for me atm been on a set of lithium lorazepram and buproprion for the past 3 months and it's worked amazingly. It's allowed me to work write and just generally focus like I used to without the mood swings and recognize when I'm becoming manic or depressed at high caliber level that I'm used to. I know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens but recently have had a string of events good bad and otherwise have caused my depression to come back in full swing. I recognize it for what it is and why I feel like this which is a huge step compared to before but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where I know just to tune it down. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system but I guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication I think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful. Because I'm really in a spot where Im really not sure how to approach it and could probably use some netflixmovie suggestions as I don't have much energy to do anything else.

46261,There is hope To those of you out there thinking no one loves you or wants you please do not give up. I have struggled so much with those thoughts recently. I was having a particularly bad day while spending time with my boyfriend this past weekend. He recognized that I wasn't doing well without me having to say anything. I told him there wasn't anything he could do to help and that I just had to work through it. He kissed me on my forehead and told me he loves me unconditionally and that broke my bad spell. It took me a bit to fully pull out of it. If I can find someone who loves me there is hope for every single one of us. Please do not give up. Focus on yourself and someone will come along.

45463,Is being forgetful part of having Bipolar? I've noticed even before I was diagnosed that I tend to forget memories a lot. I don't remember much of my childhood to teenage years except significant ones. I forget what happens to movies I just watched. If I ever get asked if I watched something and I'll say yes it doesn't really look like it because I have nothing to contribute to the discussion. That's how I kind of realized I have poor memory.I'm not talking about forgetting things I need to bring but really actual memories.Do I forget them because they just don't matter that much? It's something that I assumed just part of growing up but I'm not so sure if this is 'normal' or not. Do you have this experience too?,Bipolar

Was on seroquil 150 mg extended release at night got better but it made me sleep like a person after a week long meth binge every single night. Not to mention I gained a hefty 30 lbs in 3 months. Now I am on Tegridol but day to day I shift from completely stable to racing thoughts. Extreme confidence to loss of it all. What worked for you guys? I am not sure if I need to up my dosage of Tegridol but I don't want to start sleeping 16 hours a day again either.,Bipolar

Usually when I get auditory hallucinations they don't sound like they're coming from insidemy head it might sound as though it's across the room. But recently I've been hypomanic and maybe even going towards manic the past few nights I've definitely been hearing things on and off but tonight I can't control what seems like this constant running commentary. I've been laying trying to sleep for nearly 4 hours so far and keep getting interrupted with multiple random conversation tid bits or shouting in various voices etc. I feel like my brain is going a million miles a minute!Anyway I just want to know if anyone else knows what I'm talking about?

46147,Rapid cycling is becoming increasingly unbearable So Im bipolar one with rapid cycling. I was diagnosed about a year ago.Lately I have felt so isolated and I think I did it but self. I go one day happy about my life. And that the rest of the week it takes all of my energy just to get out of my bed.I know this comes with the illness. And I know that Im going to be OK. But in the meantime Id really like to stop crying and feeling like my life doesnt matter. I feel very alone even when I am around other people.I dont know whats wrong with me anymore.I dont remember how I ended up like this.Im so frustrated because the last three years I had so many horrible things happen. Im trying to get myself under control.I take my medicine but it doesnt seem to work. I change it. That will work for a few weeks. Then I have to move on to something else. I dont take Xanax or Clonopin. Only because my doctor doesnt want me to become dependent on them. I dont know. I guess a lot of people become addicted. I dont have an addictive personality that Im aware of. But Vistaril doesnt work. I smoke a lot of pot and that helps but where Im from its not really something you can admit. And its something I can get arrested for but its also on of the few things that calm me down enough to be rational. I dont know how to make friends. I dont know how any one could put up with me. But I dont have anyone to talk to. I know I am being irrational. But right now everything feels real. What am I suppose to do? I just want it to go away. I feel like I am being ridiculous. How did this happen? I havent always been like this... anxious yes. Ive always been a nervous person. But I was brave. And now Im afraid of everyone and everything. Im not really looking for answers. I just needed to say it. I dont want to hate my life. I want to be better. I have to get better. This cant be the rest of my life. ,Bipolar

45726,Probably hypo after med change Here I am at 6 after an hour of staring at the ceiling and trying not to move too much after going to at 230 'cause I wasn't tired. This is all coming off the back of a month long depressive episode with a lot of suicidal contemplation which was finally ended by an increase in seroquel to 300mg an increase in lamictal to 100mg twice a day and a decrease in lithium over the last few months from 900mg a day to 300. I have felt fantastic the last 4 or so days but everyone around me is freaking out because I'm too hyper and loud and all over the place especially my gf who's going through a rough patch. I can't even sit still long enough to comfort her and it's really freaking her out. Of course the only other time I've been like this was right before I crashed and burned and went to the hospital for a week so bad feelings all around I guess. It just seems odd that this would come about after an increase in seroquel and lamictal. If it stays too much longer I might drop a note for the psychiatrist because I know this isn't sustainable it just feels so damn good.Is this common to switch like this after a med change? Also how the hell do I deal with all the people freaking out thinking this is going to wind up putting me in the psych ward again?Thanks ,Bipolar
45580,Medication advice Divalproex Hi guys this is my first post so I apologize for any mistakes!! So my psych prescribed me divalproex generic Depakote and its really been helping me. But when I went to pick up my refill the pharmacy told me that it was now 114 instead of the usual 10 I pay for it. Have you had this experience? I dont understand why the price would raise by more than 100 in less than a month. I didnt switch insurance or anything. I called my insurance company and they just said the price of the medication rose this year. What should I do? Should I ask my psych to switch mood stabilizers for me? I really dont want to switch up my medication again. I was just starting to feel normal again after months of hypomania. Thanks in advance! ,Bipolar

45837,I think I might have Bipolar disorder. Back in 2014 I was diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features. I see a psychiatrist take my prozac as prescribed and go to therapy. I am now doing much better than I was then. I steal deal with depression but I can function and I know how to manage it. The only time I ever get relief from it is during the spring. From March to May I feel fantastic. I have more energy and I feel more creative and productive. When summer hits I tend to get depressed. When this happened last summer I talked with my doctor and decided to increase my dosage of prozac. It did not work and I felt weird and had suicidal ideations. He suggested what I have might be bipolar disorder. I thought he did not know what he was talking about until I remembered spring time. In the spring I am walking on sunshine. I also think I am a genius and the shit. My libido also goes up and I will do things sexually that I would not do the rest of the year. I know reddit can not diagnose Me but does my behavior make any alarm off. Any advice would be helpful.,Bipolar

But for a few days I've just been annoyed with absolutely everyone and everything. Usually when I'm hypomanic I'm in a super good mood with the grandiosity the rapid speech feeling like I need to do everything all at once etc. Sometimes I have a tendency to get super annoyed at people for stupid reasons but it's always paired with the other symptoms.

45729,I feel so hopeless 28M living with parents no savings Uber driver. Yes it's years of bad decisions largely brought on by bipolar disorder that have led me to this point. Here's the thing I was an aspiring comedian. Something got switched off about my personality 3 years ago and I don't think I can do it anymore. But I still have all the jokes I wrote 6500 of them. I'm working on editing it down to the best and am going to try to publish it. But... what if I'm completely fucking wasting my time? What if I get it completely polished to something I'm happy with go leaps and bounds the extra mile whathaveyou... and don't sell a single copy? I'm so worried about my future. To boot I don't have any friends and I haven't had a girlfriend in 5 years. I am pretty goodlooking but feel so pathetic about my life the no money the broken character the friendlessness. I'm fortunate to be a 6'2 Caucasian male with a history of health and fitness so now that I'm getting sober and focusing more on the gym I have the plausibility to get really aesthetic. But that's about all I have going for me. I can't be a broke lonely loser my whole life. I will not. I will kill myself if I don't see results after a long enough period. I feel like the pain of the world would be so dulled if just one person loved me but I have no one. I put 20 in an online poker account and am hovering at 80 and I dream of being able to make thousands that way one day to afford the life I want to live.

A lot of you talk about manic episodes so severe that your friendsfamiliesSO's have to have you formed and hospitalized etc. I've never had that. I've always been self aware in depressive episodes and known when I was close to the edge and I'm always aware when I'm hypomanic so far. It doesn't CHANGE anything like I'm still riding the wave and doing all my bad things spending sex driving fast or whatever but I'm self aware that I'm hypo. I don't need somebody to point it out to me. I know. I know that my discomfort about the moon looking at me is a delusion. I know that I shouldn't have bought the 85 eye shadow palette so to Huda Beauty your New Nudes palette is fucking beautiful but I did anyway.Anyway any insight would be nice.

It was lucky for me that my dad knew what to do and was able to convince me to get help in a very dangerous manic state. A few people close to me in the past few years have gotten mentally ill. With some success they manage to get to the hospital but there is nothing that can be done if they refuse to take medications. I have a friend whos in a psychosis state and is refusing medications. Hes not functioning and no matter how often hes brought to the hospital he wont take the medications so he cant get better.Im wondering if you guys had any experience or any thoughts on whether being involuntarily medicated while your in a complete psychosis stat should be allowed. Mostly just thinking and ranting. I just wish that there was more that I could do. Because I was the same as him 5 years ago but I was able to be convinced to take my medication.

46152,Manialike episode how do I bring this up to my psychiatrist? So I have not been dx'd with bipolar. I do have the following formal diagnoses as of now borderline personality disorder BPD double depression major depression and dysthymia generalized anxiety bulimia alcohol abuse.I'm trying to figure out how to present this to my psychiatrist. I think I've been in a manic episode for the last 23 weeks or so especially. I had started thinking this on Saturday and my significant other said he thought I seemed like I was manic for the last few weeks.My psych doc put me on 20 mg of prozac which I initially thought was making me really zombie like but then I went on a tinder spree. I have promiscuous tendencies when drinking but I usually don't actually do anything. I hit on an old boyfriend once but otherwise have been faithful to my SO.In the past month I have had sex with 3 different guys and had a multi hookup with one that I've basically been texting nonstop. I've been pounding energy drinks and alcohol and tindering and wanting to go out and do things and talk to people and dance which is weird for me because I'm introverted. My SO confronted me Friday nightSaturday and everything kind of crashed back and I'm having a what the fuck did I do moment.I felt GOOD last week. I actually felt like I had some energy despite still not sleeping any better than usual I have bad insomnia. That never happens and I want to cry because if it is actually bipolar I'm not going to get to feel like that again. My psychiatrist thinks my baseline is a depressed mood which I'm now in again. So basically I get to spend the rest of my life depressed and I don't want to have to live like that.How do I bring this up to my doctor? I have been drinking a lot so I'm worried she is going to dismiss it as a by product of that instead of something else. I've taken mood stabilizers in the past without much improvement in the depression but the focus was on the depression. I'm assuming my doctor has ruled out bipolar already.Is it weird that I would have a full blown manic episode for the first time at 26?,Bipolar

In reality his friend is on vacation and just has very bad signal so cant be in touch. He is 16 but stole my credit card to buy tickets got his passport and is planning on leaving. When I tried to talk to him he was convinced that Im with the terrorists that kidnapped his friend. His friend is an adult lady who was his caretaker for a while. I have no clue what to do. He wont speak to me anymore because Im evil. He wont take meds either because he thinks they are poison. He has dropped out of school two years ago and stays at home.

46430,Anyone ever done a liver cleanse? It honestly sounds like bullshit but Ive hit a wall recently so Im willing to expand my options a little. I was telling my pdoc about how Im struggling recovering from the holidays. When I was out of town with my family for about a week I had one beer the entire time. My four hour drive home ended up being six hours due to three separate accidents. It was taking me multiple days to recuperate it felt like I had been on a drinking binge. When I told her all this she said sometimes stress and changes in the environment can affect the way your liver functions just as much as it can affect your brain. The stress of family then being hit with an especially stressful trip from sea level to 7000 ft could have really messed things up. So Im giving this a try. She ordered some liver sauce for me. Its this gnarly tasting oil I take as soon as I wake up then thirty mins later I have to take a charcoal binder. If it were some random person telling me to ditch my meds and do a liver cleanse instead Id tell them to fuck off. But Ive been with this pdoc for almost a decade now so Im trusting her judgement. Im still on all my meds and she told me to try and be more mindful about what Im putting in my body. So Im trying to avoid the temptation of fast food even tho I dont feel like I have the energy to make healthy meals. Ive only been on it for a week so Im not expecting immediate results. Has anyone else tried out alternative methods like this? Specifically stuff that has been recommended by a doctor? ,Bipolar

46043,Need Advice About My Mom Hello RedditI'm wondering if anyone in this group may be able to shed any advice from experience about a rough journey my family and I have been going through.My mom and I are best friends. We use to talk everyday until she started a few new medications after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Once the medications hit her she no longer talks to me. No longer answers her phone. She is a lifeless walking panic attack which was never the case until medication. Last May my mom went through a traumatic experience with her brother almost being killed in Jail. He truly made a miracle of a recovery but my mom endured a lot of stress from the situation. She went to her psychiatrist who prescribed her Seroquel to help her sleep. It did not help her sleep at all. She went manic in fact. To make a long story short by the beginning of June she had been involuntarily admitted to the local psych ward on 72 hour hold. During those 72 hours they took her off seroquel and the antidepressant Paxil Paxil she had been prescribed for almost 20 years due to OCD which had toned down immensely in the past 10 years that she had even had her dosage lowered about 6 years prior to this and immediately put her on 3mg of Resperidone and 1800mg of Gabapentin. Everything was pretty normal for about 2 months after the new prescriptions then BAM. She was a completely different person. Zombielike unable to take care of herself a living walking panic attack. It was just awful. Her doctor then only put her on MORE antipsychotic medications and antidepressants as well as a benzo. Again making a long story short.. In September I had spoken to her psychiatrist on the phone during one of her appointments who agreed with me we should taper her off of antipsychotics. Now fast forward and she has officially been of antipsychotics for 2 months. She is still prescribed Gabapentin mirtazapine and diazepam. She is still in awful shape but has shown signs on being more cognitive in general.I didn't speak with her for over 2 months after Christmas. She didn't want to talk to me or anyone else at that. I saw her right before Christmas I live in a different state and told her I would like to be apart of one of her appointments again over the phone and she wouldn't let me. She moved in with her boyfriend after this all started who I feel helps her as much as he hurts her.A few weeks ago. our family dog died. She was 14 but the way it happened was super tragic. I talked with my mom the day it happened and she cried! Which was a great sign to me because 3 months before this she told he she couldn't cry if she wanted to She just had no emotion. So I took this as a great sign! I have noticed she no longer has one worded answers but she can actually respond to the things I'm saying with short responses. So I see very slow improvements. I feel the experience with my dog passing away has opened her up to me a little bit more. I talked with her again about a week after and just tried to have a normal happy conversation about me coming home for a visit in a couple of weeks and she seemed to act halfway normal again. I want to keep this door open and open her trust back up to me again so that maybe she will let me try and help her at the doctors office again one day.. How can I keep this door open? How should I approach my mom about trying to help her again at the doctors when I go home in a couple of weeks? I miss my best friend more than anything and this has been the toughest thing I have ever had to go through. If anyone has any experience dealing with horrible reactions to medications and overcoming this yourself or with a loved one. Any advice would be appreciated.P.S. I probably skipped over a lot of details so please don't hesitate to ask questions!,Bipolar
45775,Lithium and loss of identity I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 just about two years ago now and have been on lithium since. I started at I think 600 then 900 after a few weeks then 1050 a few months later and finally 1200 after my counts didn't come back after a rough bout of serotonin syndrome a year and a half ago.The changes were so slow that I didn't notice them until I went back and read posts I had made at the time. I've never really interacted with other bipolar people so I don't have much frame of reference and I've been worrying lately that I might just be different now and I don't notice it from either the lithium or the serotonin syndrome. It feels like the kind of thing that's impossible to know. I can't remember who I was six months ago much less two years.I've had the intrusive thought of stop taking your meds they're bad for you and you don't like swallowing them and was hoping to reach out for some commentary one way or the other. I hope this makes sensesounds familiar to someone at least. ,Bipolar

46150,Unmanageable seroquel side effects after two years I've been on seroquel for about two years now and over the last couple of months I've developed side effects that I can't handle anymore and I don't know what to do. My pdoc prescribed adderall about a year and a half ago to counteract the sedation I feel even after taking my meds at night. Lately my muscles are so stiff and sore I can hardly move and sometimes it hurts so much I can't do anything but just cry. After taking my meds and laying down in bed my nose stuffs up out of nowhere and I can't breathe at all and my heart starts pounding and when I try to breathe out of my mouth and finally start falling asleep I can feel my breath slowing down and I panic that I'm going to stop breathing and I jerk awake. My legs are so restless and twitchy and I get so frustrated and I can't breathe and I don't know what to do other than just sob and wait it out until the seroquel knocks me out. This lasts for an hour or two every night. I don't even want to take the meds anymore because I know how shitty I'm going to feel. I don't even want to go to sleep anymore. I know when I tell my pdoc she's just going to try to convince me to switch back to lithium which I will never do. I had horrible painful acne so bad I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror without sobbing and wanting to die her response was wear makeup.Has anyone else had side effects like these? I don't know what changed recently and why I'm feeling this way after being relatively stable for so long. ,Bipolar
45542,Buspar and hypomania? My pdoc had me try buspar for anxiety last week. Within 2 days of starting it at a low dose5mg 3x a day I was the most euphoric I've ever been. I was skipping instead of walking I couldn't stay on topic at allmy friend described me as being squirrely I threw stuff at another friend for 2 hours I went walking in the river off campus I was so euphoric it was like a body high I talked about sexual stuff a lot. I went to class but scribbled entire pages of my notebook so I wouldn't start doing jumping jacks in class. This was all in a 24 hour time period. Needless to say I talked to my pdoc and went off it within a day of these symptoms starting. I came down over a couple days and was pretty depressed for a couple days. What I'm wondering is whether any of y'all have had this side effect from buspar. It's not listed on the pi sheet but there are a couple case reports in journals. Before I started it my pdoc told me that mania was pretty unlikely from it...,Bipolar
46084,Hi I'm bp1 and this is my 1st public post. Appreciates help and support Hi friends and lovers and haters I find myself here after 4 years of being diagnosed bipolar one and still needing support from literally anyone that will listen. I really appreciate that considerate feed back that I have read on this forum or sub whatever it is I'm new. I cognitively understand what I need to do to get better and resume life after constant states of bipolar depression mixed with mdd and severe anxiety but I have trouble starting and maintaining habits. Does anyone have any tactics for flattening out the constant flux? Also I am wondering how I can most effectively help the community. Love and ?,Bipolar

46406,A bit disappointed about psych evaluation I thought I would get a very thorough evaluation but instead I just got 30 minutes of basic questions I didn't even fill out any forms and then was told by the pdoc they would treat me for 'bipolar depression' then I was given a prescription and out the door. I don't know if he thinks it's bipolar 1 or bipolar 2 or if he just hasn't decided yet can it be tentative?Did I just go to the wrong place? I thought psych evaluations were supposed to be really thorough. It just didn't seem thorough enough to me.,Bipolar

The nurses are complete jerks who move all of my things take up the laundry room to wash towels all day chain smoke and other not professional behavior. On top of that I recently made a mistake and now two of my closest friends wont even speak to me or if they do its to cancel plans that we had made.

46429,I Hate Myself for Being Psychotic I had a psychotic break six months ago and was diagnosed Bipolar I... I spent 40 consecutive days in a mental hospital and have been depressed ever since. I used to have a ton of hobbies and interests now all I do is work and sleep. I still feel so much guilt and shame over what I did when I was psychotic. I became convinced my mother is evil who's perfectly normal and sent crazy emailsmessages to SO MANY people. I ruined a couple relationships I care about. I said so many disgusting things.How do you forgive yourself for being psychotic? Rationally I guess it wasn't my fault but it really feels like I thought my way to this point.

45922,Lamictal and Memory Loss Hey everyone! I'm 17 here going on 18. I first started taking lamictal in early 2016 to treat my depression but only started taking it consistently a few months ago. I used to just take whenever I'd wake up which could range from anywhere from the early morning to late in the day but the only noticeable effect that it produced was that if I missed a dose my body would physically crave it. A few months ago I began taking it at a regimented time everyday as to give it the opportunity to properly regulate in my system. About a month into doing that I started to feel different. I've always been one of the sharper kids praised for my vocabulary and my writing ability which may not come off in this post but I'm really just looking for help here. It's all that I really had to pride myself on at a young age and it carried over into just being a part of my identity but over the past two months I've just felt like I've been losing myself. I struggle to keep up in conversation my word find seems to come and go and I just feel slow. I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level but I feel like a piece of me is missing. I've also been having terrible mood swings going from happy to sad to complacent to ragingly angry within about twenty minutes. I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level but I feel like a piece of me is missing.My biggest concern though is that I'm experiencing brain damage as I've banged my head up a little bit. This started getting really bad around the same time I started better regulating my dosage and I'm not discounting that as a possibility making it hard for me to figure out if it's my medication or if I just destroyed myself for the rest of my life. At the same daily dosage for nearly two years I've never experienced anything like this so my question would be this Was my irregular dosing the reason that I wasn't experiencing these things earlier and will these effects go away after I wean myself off? EDIT I've had a significantly worse sense of humor over the past month. I know that this sort of thing is common but can lamictal actually make you more serious? I can't seem to find anything on the subject.,Bipolar

46163,Am i BiPolar? Ok so I have been struggling with these severe mood swings for almost 4 years. I thought it was just severe suicidal depression but recently within the past year i have been experiencing these nights or grouping of nights where I would stay up and do a ton of random projects and crazy work ideas. Nothing ever got done but after not sleeping and all I would crash. I would hit a depressing suicidal low and not know when it's going to end. Currently this is the longest depressive episode at almost 3 weeks. It's to the point where my grades went from A's to F's and my parents think it's anxiety. I go to a therapist but she doesn't know the full story. I also am being evaluated but that takes months. Ii am taking AP Psych in school and we are learning about mental illnesses and i realized i may be bipolar. 'm trying to keep family out of it while also getting help. Can someone help me? Do you think I have bipolar disorder?,Bipolar
45994,Does anyone else experience different types of personality surges? I have never been clinically diagnosed but the closest symptoms Ive detected are in the bipolar category. So I was wondering if anyone else encounters this? Its not like multiple personality disorder where each personality takes over the body and does their own thing. While the main personality doesnt remember at all or is forced to be in the back. Im conscious and can control each one of them I can basically bite my tongue before bad things happen. One side is apologetic cant make up my mind sluggish sleepy full on emo emu depression mode pushes everyone away and doubts everything and everyone. One side feels like its just a burst of anger Like it can easily make someone cry by just telling them off a demon in its own way. While the other one is bubbly fun can do anything and everything the life of the party a daredevil a creator an artist who can easily pull all nighters. Is this how bi polar works? I know there are like manic phases and etc. Are those it? Please and thank you everyone,Bipolar

Not only did I miss my therapy appointment last week I was so busy and I completely forgot because I hadn't been in two weeks due to the holidays but I never started taking my lamictal like I was supposed to start like 3 weeks ago? Still taking 450mg of Wellbutrin. I feel amazing like really really good even though I am going through a lot of financial stress right now. I'm cleaning and organizing almost all day and I've posted like 40 items for sale on the market place in the last couple of days. I guess this is hypomania and I don't want it to stop. I'm scared of feeling numb. I haven't felt this good for this long in months. But today I got a call from the mental health department at Kaiser saying that the psychiatrist who prescribed me the Lamictal wants a follow up with me in a couple of weeks. Fuck. Should I lie? Be honest? If I'm honest how am I going to justify my decision? Either way I'm going to feel so ashamed but I don't regret my decision right now. ??,Bipolar

46461,Pauses in symptoms during hypomania Is it possible to experience a break in symptoms during hypomania? For example I may feel very tired from the lack of sleep for a few hours during the day feel ashamed of hypersexual symptoms or just feel like I've snapped back to my true selfcalmed down only for this fleeting break to end and be brought back up. I'm new to all this and am not yet wellversed enough on the illness or my own individual symptoms to be able to differentiate between a genuinely high mood with the normal mood fluctuations all people experience or being hypomanic. I'm using either zopiclone or ambien regularly for sleep at the moment so I don't know if the drowsiness is perhaps just a hangover from those. I'm also starting abilify though at a very low 2mg so far so unsure if that's potentially causing certain symptoms I'm having as well. I appreciate any insight from you all.,Bipolar

The last 4 weeks of being on this drug I can only describe as trauma actual PTSD nausea inducing flashbacks and it makes me queasy even to write. Its therapeutic to rant but mostly Im just so frightened to try any other drug ever again. It made me aggressively suicidal if anyone is thinking of trying this drug and wants more details ama Ive already been on the basics I feel lithium seroquel lamictal saphris.

45669,Meds Rollercoaster So I think I've been on pretty much all the antipsychotics now. Right now I'm on Latuda before it was Abilify before that it was Geodone. The list goes on. My libido has gone in the toilet the last year or so. My doc says could be the dopamine being suppressed. So now he's added Wellbutrin to the mix. It's been only one day but I've gotta say I'm getting really sick of these meds and the side effects. I really hope my sexdrive comes back. If it doesn't I think I may consider just white knuckling it and getting off all this crap. I've been on meds since 2001. Started with Risperdal.Hate that crap. I swear my fingers got fat on that stuff. Has anyone been through this low libido stuff ? Is there any hope ? Has anyone been on an antipsychotic and had wellbutrin added to the mix ? What were the results. Looking for any kind of advice or input. Thanks,Bipolar
46073,Post Manic Decisions How to Love Yourself After Mania Man this month has been really rough will self realizations. I don't know if any of you can relate. After being super manic for a few months and then having some mixed episodes it left me in the worst depression I've ever experienced this month. I've been spending a lot of time in bed and not leaving the house sleeping a lot suicidal but not acting on it basically depressed AF. Anyway my mind recently started having flash backs to stupid decisions and things I've don't while I've been manic. This isn't just the most recent manic episode it's flashbacks from my entire life. I did some not so great things made some not so great choices and went through some traumatic shit. I keep trying to meditate or do breathing exercises to let the thoughts pass. Anyway it's not going well it's pretty much been mental torture. Physically it makes me cry out of nowhere have panic attacks crazy sleep patterns throw up and some other fun stuff.Recently I've been feeling like a prisoner of my own mind just sitting here with my thoughts rotting my mind. It feels like my mind is trying to torture me and my body is trying everything it can do to survive. I'm stuck in mental illness purgatory. I've been trying to hang in there. Any healthy suggestions to try to make peace with the fucked things I've done while manic? I'm always too hard on myself but some days my brain feels like it's taking over my body and I'm not driving this human vehicle anymore. The thoughts and visualizations of the past have just been haunting me. ,Bipolar

45903,Bad Generic Lamictal So I've been taking the teva version of lamictal for years and it's been very effective. However apparently the workers went on strike and other companies are having to make it. The pills I'm getting now are completely useless and may actually be making things worse. I've told my doctor and he's doing what he can I've been going to him for 14 years and I know he'd never try to screw me over so I trust him but I am falling into a huge hole and my anxiety is kicking hardcore.

Short background on me I have bipolar type two disorder fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome depression anxiety ADHD carpal tunnel syndrome asthma hypothyroidism insomnia Hypertension. I believe undiagnosed PTSD. I am disabled I havent been able to work in several years my health is just getting worse. Ive been sick I was 19 and Im still only 31 Im stuck in bed and barley able to walk everyday . Im in constant pain. Not looking for sympathy or anything I just need to vent. I guess its hard for me to talk about on the Internet to complete strangers even though reading on Reddit is a great comfort to me. I cant drive anymore. I need help with everything. I have to depend on my family for everything Im lucky that I have them and that I do have least with my mom as a support system. Though I dont have anybody to help me right now so Im gonna have to run out and get my medication I have no idea how Im going to do that Im trying to find a ride right now because Im out of my medication. Im feeling so down that I just cant motivate myself to leave. Where I live its freezing cold its dark and gloomy. I dont have any friends where I live I have no social life because Im in constant suffering constant pain . Everything causes pain. So I know when I leave the house because I have no choice Im going to be in so much more pain. I guess thats one of the main reasons besides being depressed that its so hard for me. I guess I just need to vent thanks for listening. Im usually more on depressed Spectrum then manic. Hang in there I take some comfort in knowing that all of us are true warriors. I hope this makes sense Im a little scatterbrained and very tired I didnt get much sleep last night I never sleep well. And again thank you listening Id love to return the favor. ,Bipolar

46316,It's over My brother gave up the fight and killed himself. He was very depressed officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder and in a very bad state. We tried multiple terapists letting him living alone letting him living with us and nothing worked. He did not want to fight and made plans about making plans which he simply ignored later. There was nothing we could do and yet I feel like there was something we did not think of and should have done. We totally fucked up and couldn't support him the way he needed it. It fucking sucks everything fucking sucks. Our society fucking sucks at dealing with people like him. Fuck it.,Bipolar

46383,Looking for tips for my husband My husband was recently diagnosed with Bipolar II. He hasnt been able to be in our home because he is actively in his illness and its just not good for our child to be around. But because of this added stress of not being home hes been in a really bad place mentally like worse than ever. Ive been trying to help but theres not really much I can do beyond just encouraging him to learn more about Bipolar disorder talking to him listening etc. I dont really know much myself and Im worried about him. Can any of you guys tell me what knowledge or practice has helped you most? Maybe groups to connect with other people who experience this?Sorry if this is redundant to other questions asked and TIA. ,Bipolar
46112,Finding help Hi So I dont know how to start this I dont know If Im bipolar but thats what Im looking to find out. Since late middle school Ive felt depressive moods cut myself for 3years started partying doing drugs and drinking at a really young age and got pretty promiscuous. I never thought I was depressed because sometimes Id feel really happy and I was capable of that. I thought I was schizophrenic because sometimes I feel delusional or lately Ive started kind of seeing things or just being extremely terrified of seeing things. I even started to hear my dog choke the other day and when I yelled about it to my sister she said she heard nothing. I just learned that people who are bipolar have delusions and hallucinations so that part makes sense. I dont do drugs or cut myself anymore and after those things I tried really hard to clean up my act and managed to do very good in school and still am but I have absolutely no motivation and I get distracted SO EASILY like not even adderall will help me again I thought I had adhd but found out this is also a symptom of being bipolar. My mom will sometimes call me squirrel because Ill talk so fast and leap from topic to topic but other times I cant even talk to anyone because I get so irritated. I also have weird sleep patterns I cant go to bed even when Im tired and I feel the need to sleep for an incredibly long time most of the time. I also just hate myself I hate how I look so much despite constantly being praised for what I look like and whT I achieve. I dont know if Im just being paranoid or If I have general anxiety disorder or if Im bipolar... Im scared to reach out snd get help I dont know how. I get so hysterical and I cry so easily and I am so incredibly anxious. My family doctor is an asshole and my family would completely destroy me if they found out I was getting therapy when they were alerted by my teacher who found out I was cutting myself my mom was sad for about a minute and to this day 56yrs since they found out my dad will stay make fun of me for being depressed about nothing and cutting myself. None of them understand mental illness or why anyone with privilege would be mentally ill because they grew up in communist poland and had to escape and they were fine so I just feel stuck but I hate feeling like this I dont know what to do. Tldr i feel like i could be bipolar but im unsure I dont know what to do or how to get help. Family would kill me if they knew. ,Bipolar
46225,Adderall combating the negative sides of lamictal. Lamictal was causing me to sleep all day and be a lazy slum who sat on his phone all day and didnt have any motivation to engage in productive activities as seen in my recent post. But I was sane and safe so it needed to be this way.I've convinced my doc to give me an adderall script because im genuinely afraid that my lamictal brain is not adequate for passing my January exams. Adderall is making me sleep 6 hours a night which makes me feel amazing. I used to sleep 6 hours back before I was medicated and it feels just so fucking good. for some reason the less I sleep the better I feel. I haven't felt this fucking energized in a while. I only took 20mg 2 days ago and 10mg yesterday. Im making this post becauseI was wondering if any of you have a similar situation where less sleep makes you feel better? And if you have any similar medication history and if you can provide any insight into this situation to me? How did these realizations help you and what were your next steps?If I told my doctor that adderall was making me sleep less would she take it away from me? I only take it to study but I fucking love sleeping 6 hours. I felt well rested when I woke up today for the first time in like 6 months. Im wondering if I can tell her this information or if she would be worried about it triggering mania. She mentioned to me that she wanted to do a sleep test on me.thanks for reading any input is appreciated.,Bipolar
46259,Loss and depression go really well together I was doing well on new medication ping ponging a bit but never getting fully manic or fully depressed. Now I knew I would be depressed for about two weeks after the end of the semester. The change in schedule always does it. But during the second half of the semester a good friend passed away. Afterwards a good mutual friend started acting very strange sometimes flat out mean. Our relationship was strained for about a month for reasons I don't fully know. He eventually blocked me online even though we had agreed that no matter what we would say goodbye as he was graduating. I was easily able to push it all away when I needed to during the semester. Now I just keep falling deeper and deeper as opposed to the normal brief depression. I can't think of my friend that passed without thinking of the one that blocked me and vice versa. They were my two go tos the people I talked to every day and who made me feel secure. My world was turned upside down. Two of the very few people I would go to are gone. I don't know how to pull myself out this time and honestly I'm scared.,Bipolar
45582,99 problems and hypomania is all of them Ive been fairly manic the past 2 or so weeks sleeping maybe 45 hours on a good daynight I work at a 24hour hospital and eating just enough that I dont crumble every time I stand. Additionally Ive been having relationship problems that have been overwhelming me to uncontrollable tears every second that I stop and think about my life. Ive been gogogo nonstop working 70 hour weeks because I couldnt say no when I was asked to pick up shifts and have definitely not been chill towards my body. Im now starting to feel the repercussions of the past few weeks my body is dragging my words dont come out right even the kids I work with called me out on it and my thoughts would get a reckless driving ticket if they could operate a motor vehicle.

My mom was always focused on my little brother and step dad. Sisters are way older than me so they already had their lives when I was barely a teen.Tldr I raised my self.I'm so depressed and having panic attacks. I have no insurance.

46337,Just casually sharing my lifestory I never share my genuine and real problems with anyone close to me and I just want to get some things off my chest.Disclaimer Don't be stupid and go off your medication in a single day without anybody watching it like I did. This could seriously harm you don't do it learn from my mistakes. Also try not to lie if that's a problem for you.ampx200BWhen I was 14 my mother first took me to a GP to ask for a referral to a children's psychiatrist. From there on it was a whirlwind of seeing different psychiatrists and receiving different diagnoses. 2 years later it was agreed that I had bipolar II and I was put on medication and sent to therapy. ampx200BI'm not sure how medication worked for me I was prescribed some moodstabilisers and I took them and after I was asked how they work for me I said yeah they are great despite not feeling any difference at all. Therapy didn't help me either I'm a selfdiagnosed compulsive liar and therapy did nothing for me because I just lied to my therapist about a bunch of trivial things so I never allowed her to get close. I think I lie mostly because I don't like people getting to know too much about me and my life though often I also just lie for no reason at all. I'm not a sociopath or psychopath I do experience emotions very much and sometimes I get angry at myself for lying to people I care about. ampx200BFor some reason at some point when I was 17 I just could not manage to call my psychiatrist nor my therapist for another appointment. My mother who is a supportive and kind person normally who however always stigmatised and made fun of me for mental health issues despite having some herself refused to call them for me on the basis that I'm 17 I should be able to do this for myself now.ampx200BSo I never went back to my psychiatrist and that meant no more pharmacy recipes for my medication. That's how I uncontrolledly went off my moodstabilisers. It was a whirlwind and it pushed me right back to the start of my problems. Don't do this. This is stupid and dangerous and not recommended by ANYBODY.ampx200BSince then I have learned to control myself better and I have learned coping methods that help me. I still know I am going through phases of depression and hypomania and rapidcycling. I am learning methods that help me push through it. I believe I'm at a point in my life where I have the will and drive to get help and medication again but I try to cope. I'm turning 21 soon and currently enrolled halftime at an online university. I study in English which is not my native language but I enjoy it very much and it's a field I am very very interested in. I have a boyfriend who is older than me and financially supports me. I am a supportive family that I could always come back to running if I dropped out of university it would not be the end of the world. Even though I dropped out of high school right before graduation because I stood no chance at ever passing the math final I could get a job and not worry about money thanks to my family's circumstances.ampx200BNow I mostly suffer from the 'side effect' symptoms of BP II as I like to call them delusions emotional intensity binging on various things and irritability. I sometimes get bouts of feelings of guilt for things that are long done with or just for no reason. I feel highly emotional about wasting food money other things. Which can be a challenge when you experience hypomania sometimes lol.ampx200BThank you for reading if you came this far I hope you're coping well. I'm not sure whether I ever told my story this honestly.,Bipolar

46323,Anxiety level 1000000 Husband's surprise Christmas present For Christmas my husband bought me a 6 week training program at a local boxing club. I've never done classlike exercising so I was pretty concerned that my social anxiety would be a problem. I was right.The training program includes a strict meal plan and weekly weighins. If you lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks then you get all your money back. Unfortunately it's triggered my eating disorder and now I'm restricting like a mofo.The first class I went to I had to sit out part of the time because I almost passed out. I've done 3 classes so far and it's incredibly embarrassing when I have to take a break to sit down while everyone else is still up and punching their bags.I know I shouldn't compare myself to everyone else because I'm just a beginner and they might not be but I can't help it.I think it's sending me into a depressive state. All I want to do is sleep and not think about going to class or eating...ampnbspTLDR My husband bought me a 6 week boxing training program and it's triggered my mental state and my eating disorder... Has anyone dealt with this sort of thing??,Bipolar
45839,Switching to Abilify questions and concerns I got taken off 100 mg of Seroquel. It kept me stable and on a pretty good sleep schedule. My anxiety and mood were under control. I stopped self medicating with alcohol. I also moved to a much less stressful environment and was put on 100 unemployability by the VA. I have a very supportive bf. Things were going well. The only problem with Seroquel was weight gain. It was driving me crazy that I was working out constantly and eating better than I ever have but still seeing fat accumulate all over. The doc I see now put me on 5 mg Abilify and 2.5 mg of Ambien on Wednesday. Its Saturday where I live and Ive slept no more than 3 4 hours each night. My anxiety is so pronounced that I barely leave the house. The doc also mentioned that he doesnt believe I have bipolar its a military doc of course because I have seemed quite stable duh because the meds were working and said that hed probably take that diagnosis off before he PCSs. I had also told him Id be on Abilify before with no effect but he said I should try it because it might work this time. Im exhausted. How long should I wait this out and has anyone had success with it?,Bipolar
45703,Bipolar and shrooms Hi just last year I was diagnosed bipolar type II. I'm not really clear on my diagnose since I've never been on a manic state my psychiatrist says I have hypomania. But the truth is that most of the time I'm really depressed. I get triggered by an ongoing relationship with a friend that used to be my boyfriend but now just see each other from time to time and have sex. We love each other but kind of in a friendly way. This new relationship dinamic that has been going on since December last year has been a real struggle for me since I really don't want to loose his support and love and sex. It means a lot to me maybe the only thing that keeps me going on. Most of the times we don't talk during the week and I wait for him to talk to me this makes me very sad and it triggers my depression. Not long ago I decided that I wanted to do shrooms. 6 years ago I did them but I was naive and a fool I did a very low dosage and I was a very different person from now I didn't get very much insight. Now I would like to consult with magic shrooms 1 gram to start off. Last year has been a rollercoaster for the meds. Right now I'm taking 250 mg of lamictal topamax 25 mg 3 times a day risperidal 0.5 mg and 200 mg of quietapine. I'm really open to all suggestions I'm hoping this can be an eye opening experience that will help me in the future maybe help me being so dependant on relationships.I'm thinking about doing this with a friend we would like to do it on a place with lots of nature. The first time I did it was on the woods and I was really happy and connected to the greenery of the forest. Please let me know your opinionsEdit please so that you may understand a little bit more about my relationship. I do not feel like I'm in a bad relationship. In fact we have a great dinamic and connection and we understand and love each other. We decided to stop labeling as girlfriendboyfriend because right now it can bring so much stress in this period of our life's. It my case it was making me enter into a very dependant attitude and he was sucking up all of that energy and getting depressed too. So we decided to break up stop seeing each other with the same frequency start acting more like friends and when we see each other indulge in sex as a natural and healthy activity and enjoy or spend some time together watching movie hiking on the nature. So if you see we have been doing this maybe 2 months or so. We see each other every 2 weeks or 1 week. He tells me that this year's that he is focused on creating and expanding his work not really looking for a girlfriend and I do believe him so when he tells me this. I'm really on the same boat with this I just got a good paying job I'm painting eating healthy taking my meds exercising a bit sleeping on time.He will be travelling on June maybe to Europe 3 months and it will be tough for me but I think that that time will be a deciding period for me to think things over. I will miss him very much but it will make me a tougher woman I'm 28 but sometimes I still feel like a little afraid girl. I'm still very positive that everything will turn all right and that even with him or without him I'm going to be okay. Today I woke up in a good mood. ,Bipolar
46389,What did you wish you knew sooner? If you could go back and tell yourself or someone newly dx advice about living with BP that you wish you knew then what would that be?I would say Sometimes all you can do is endure an episode until it passes. It might not get better yet despite doing everything right to take care of yourself and that isn't failure. You're doing the work. Know what's at stake. Mental illness can take whatever it wants and never give it back. Your hopefulness and dedication can save youGather at least one or two people you can tell when you're becoming unwell with whom you can just be. Whether that's a space to talk a couch to lie on monitor you wellness check ins people who know when to call your doctor or 911.be honest with care providers about how bad it is. Showing up well when you are not well is preventing you from getting necessary care.Some people won't stay in your life because of what happens when you're sick. It will hurt. This has nothing to do with your worthiness of love and care and connection. You're not bad.There will be terrible regrets for what you have done while unwell. One of the few ways I have found to heal is to dispel the crippling shame with whatever forgiveness and empathy. I will do right in the future. I am going to win. Of course... All of these come to me while I'm in remission and experiencing wellness. Thank you for reading. I'm hoping to learn from all of you who respond.,Bipolar
45472,I've been wondering about having bipolar for a while. So I've been at a psychiatrist for about a year now and been diagnosed with depression and ADHD the psychiatrist used them quite interchangeably. I've been taking SSRI medications for a while now.But sometimes when I would go for a scheduled appointment I didn't feel depressed at all then a couple of days later I would be back in depression.Now my depression feels completely cured. I haven't been able to see any effects of it for over two weeks I even didn't take antidepressants for a week I know I really shouldn't have done it and I started taking them again and nothing happened.This took me by complete surprise since nothing in my life has changed during this time. I have been considering the possibility of a longer hypomanic episode but I don't what bipolar is like.I sleep very poorly so I can't comment on the reduced need of sleep that is associated with mania.I will talk about this at my next appointment but would really appreciate input from people with bipolar.,Bipolar
45762,Getting really hyperactive when 'manic'? Let me first say I'm not officially diagnosed with bipolar and idk if I'm posting on the right place I'm diagnosed with several things but mainly BPD. Psych says I likely have fast cycling bipolar type 1 and I guess I'm not diagnosed because she's focusing on my BPD first. I've had a really destructive psychotic manicmixed? phase that made me drop out and get hospitalized last yearI don't know whether I should be calling this manic since I don't know whether its from BPD or my possible bipolar. But when I get manic I get extremely hyperactive next to the usual mania symptoms my friend just asked if I was on cocaine. I talk like crazy constantly shaking twitchy. Its so weird. I'm just sitting here in front of my desk legs shaking eyes barely blinking. I feel so amazing yet scared I'm about to go run to maybe calm down and get some weedI've had these moods for years. Usually these moods last from about a day to 2 weeks. They probably last longer but turn more into an irritated mood. I am medicated I'm on seroquel and while it helps me a lot it doesn't get rid of this. Sorry if this post is all over the place I'm really not thinking straight,Bipolar
46069,Could I have Bipolar? I recently went to a psychologist after an intervention from my family because I had textbook severe depression for a couple months. The psychologist said I had a lot of red flags for bipolar 1. I was sleeping 14 hours a day and taking NyQuil without my parents knowing to stop suicidal thoughts. I would rather be asleep than deal with thoughts. I was skipping school practice and extracurriculars and then failing tests. When I wasn't asleep I was in bed in a dark room just staring at the ceiling. To be all honest though it started before the depression. 6 months ago I was extremely paranoid. I was staying up all hours of the night checking corners and simulating what I would do if someone came into my house to attack me. It got really bad because I was sleep deprived and it devolved from just being paranoid of strangers to my close friends watching their every move to see if they were out to get me like my thoughts were making me believe. Out of nowhere I started dissociating soon there would be 10 minute chunks of time where my brain would just disappear and I didn't know where it went. After this I started to get paranoid delusions where I would believe the alien gods that live in a black hole were going to abduct me because I knew about them. I had a panic attack during my lunch period. At this point I had no idea what was going on I thought I was going crazy but because I even had that thought I knew I wasn't. Now this is where things went really downhill. I woke up one day with the best mood I've ever had. When I was at school everybody thought I was high just because of the way I was acting. I was all spaced out and I talked over everyone. Nothing I said made any sense. No one really thought anything of it though because everybody assumes I smoke weed because of my personality. I was functioning on 120 with less than 2 hours of sleep per night. All of my inhibitions left me at this stage. I started smoking on school property and also selling weed on school property. This is not something I would ever do because I'm a straight A student and I'm top of my class so this has especially a lot of risk. I was also very close to doing cocaine. This lasted for a week and a half. After all of this I came down really hard and this is when my depression started as I explained above. I told all of this to my psychologist and she recommended me to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible because my manic like periods are dangerous. The thing is is I don't was to go to a psychiatrist because then it is more real and I might be too young to even get a mood disorder diagnosis. Oh yeah I forgot to mention I'm 15. I wanted to post this because I am so lost as to what to do. My mother is very concerned because of my depression symptoms and she is pressuring me to go. I'm conflicted. Should I go to the psychiatrist if so should I go asap or should I wait a couple of years?,Bipolar
45522,Rant I KNEW IT! My medication is poisoning me! I originally posted this over in the rCasualConversation Weekly Chat Thread but upon reflection realized it would be much better suited to this sub as it's pretty specific towards my disorder and I feel I'd get better advice here from people who are knowledgable of what I've been dealing with. From my original postgtIt'll be 8 years this summer since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and got put on a treatment consisting of DepakoteEpilum sodium valporate for rapid cycling moods and mania. Over the years I've constantly inquired about what sort of side effects I would experience on this drug and every single time my doctors have been frustratingly vague and flippant never sitting down and going through the effects in a thorough and detailed manner.gtAs a result I've had to do my own research and recently I uncovered several side effects that NO ONE told me aboutgtAccording to what I've read in numerous articles and medical journals prolongedlong term usage of sodium valporate can apparently CAUSE depressive episodes and according to the many medical journals I've perused it is not as effective against treating depressive bipolar episodes in the long run. Considering that I've been dealing with crippling bouts of depression over the last 7 years this makes sense but noone told me. NO ONE TOLD ME.gtIt can cause pancreatic damage and liver problems on it's own. My pyschiatric doctor the one who typically prescribes me this shit on a 3 monthly basis has been constantly drilling it into me that all the times I've gotten elevated liver enzyme readings from my 68 weekly blood tests has been because I drank alcohol whilst taking this fucking medication. Not once has she ever stopped to inform me that this stuff causes liver problems all by itself regardless of whether you drink or not let alone any mention of trouble involving the pancreas which is typically characterized by intense crampingpain in the abdomen due to organ damage and inflammation of the pancreas. This makes SO MUCH SENSE considering that all these years I've had neardaily cramping and aches in my abdomen that I always previously thought was due to IBS or my IUD being a dick.gtApparently it can increase the likelihood of polycystic ovary syndrome and something called hyperandrogenism which I have never heard of before now but is a condition to do with having too many androgens or male hormonestestosterone in the body along with uterine fibroids which also explains the agonizing cramps I often get regardless of what time of the month it is. Also I was at childbearing age 22 when they first started me on sodium valporate and whilst I have no desire to ever procreate the fact of the matter is that all these conditions lead to infertility so I feel incredibly deceived by the doctors who put me on this shit because again NOONE TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.gtI am absolutely steaming and yet I just know that ifwhen I raise these issues with my current psych doctor she will no doubt laugh off my concerns like she always fucking does and dismiss my worries as trivial.gtI know it's dangerous to quit cold turkey but I honestly feel so betrayed right now considering all that I've learned. I ended up writing a strongly worded but teethgrittingly polite letter outlining all these concerns so I can slap her in the face with it not literally but y'know and get my voice heard.gtI want to change my doctor and try to get one who will help me find an alternative course of treatment but giving that all this happened on public healthcare which is often laughably crap at times here it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being a long drawn out process.gtUrgh. I'm so angry I could spit fire!,Bipolar
46062,How did you know? Hi y'all I've been struggling a lot with my mental health. I'm currently seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist but I feel like I'm not getting better. I'm on medication for anxiety and depression I feel like it's not working and I'm just like I was before. it worked for about 3 weeks I was on a crazy high then I started feeling shitty againI have this gut feeling that there's something more going on that depression and anxiety. I was wondering if anyone could tell me how they were able to get proper help and what they were feeling? I feel like a lot of things in my head I'm too scared to tell my therapist for fear of being judged or called 'crazy'. Thanks in advanced for any help! ,Bipolar

I'm probably the closest I've ever been to being healthy and stable because I've finally found a doctor who listens to me and wants to help but I've also had lifelong sleep issues and when it gets to be 2 or 3 in the morning I just get so depressed and my impulse control goes straight to zero overeating impulsive spending etc.Does anyone else ever deal with nighttime loss of control? If so how have you dealt with it?

Even now when I miss my nightly dose Ill wake up so easily and positive and it makes me miss not waking up in a fog. I dont need advice just needed to vent a little. I used to be a morning person and now I cant be. I cant even be a night person because I have to take my meds and knock out at a certain time. I guess thats the price to pay for overall stability. ,Bipolar
45470,Dont know if I have Borderline Personality Disorder or Bipolar? Sorry if my this doesnt come out properly I feel sometimes as if I have so many Things to say but I dont know exactly what it is to say. This is mostly a venting. When I was a kid I was diagnosed with Depression. Ive mostly felt depressed my entire life due to emotional physical and sexual abuse growing up. I was always tired fatigued I could barely get up in the morning and do things as simple as brushing my hair taking a shower eating etc. After I got married whenever my husband and I would get into arguments I would feel so overwhelmed with emotions that I would scream and start to hit him it literally felt like my mind was going to burst and sometimes I would place my hands on my head to keep my thoughts from blowing up. But then when I would blow up I would start screaming and hitting things without any discernible purpose. We just thought I was just an overly emotional person because we never assumed anything was wrong other than my depression. So we went through several years of that until a few years ago I had an emotional affair with someone that literally seemed it came out of NOWHERE. At that time We started going to a doctor for depression where he also diagnosed me with bipolar depression? and anxiety. and then prescribed me vibryyd then lamictol trileptol Zoloft Gabpentin sorry for the spelling and then finally Wellbutrin. Not all at the same time just in a period of a year I also went to a therapist who told me to pretty much divorce my husband and at that time I felt like that was the greatest thing to do so I went through with it up until the paperwork and then suddenly decided I didnt want to go through with it. Around that time I also stopped my affair extremely abruptly it felt like I literally woke up one day and didnt want anything to do with that person and situation. Throughout all this time Ive had about 15 jobs either quitting or being fired. I would be really happy for months I would be excellent at my job then suddenly I felt like doing nothing I would lose complete interest and that showed in my quality of work. There was also a point where I drank heavily when I had the affair to the point where I would be drunk everyday. That feeling to get drunk did go away just as quickly as the feeling to have the affair did as well. Thankfully my husband and I got through it all he forgave me and Ive been extremely consistent with my medicine and trying to make things as easy as possible for my mental health. My doctor at that time prescribed me Xanax for my anxiety with did not help AT ALL. It made me feel like hell. If I took it and didnt fall asleep immediately after my body and bones would feel like they were shaking and my mind felt like everything was sped up even more. This caused me to jump in front of oncoming traffic to kill myself because the pain was just so bad. I wasnt harmed thankfully but I did get baker acted until I weaned my self off the Xanax which was an incredibly low dose if I remember correctly. I also put on 20 pound during this time which worsened my depression. After all this my doctor took me off Xanax and lamictol and just kept me on a new medicine Wellbutrin CL 300mg I felt GREAT. I suddenly had all the energy in the world and was able to get up and do things! I did have some depressive days but they went away fairly quickly. I was really happy I thought I found the medicine for me! But it stopped working I got more depressed and at the same time I found myself getting More and more irritable my emotions blew up again I couldnt have arguments without screaming in a rage and hitting myself or my husband and my anxiety was getting worse to the point of being angry and irritated all the time. Instead of going back to the doctor we found a new one and he pretty much told me that my old doctor was just treating my depression while my bipolar disorder was not in check. So he decreased my Wellbutrin to 150mg and gave me back my lamictol and added 25mg of seroquel as a sleep aid. Im happy that this doctor is really trying to fix what the last doctor messed up but my concern now is that what if I just have Borderline personality disorder instead? Someone told me that those people have REALLY intense emotions which is what I feel now but I dont want to diagnose myself when the doctor already told me I have bipolar disorder. I just have a lot of distrust if that makes sense. Also this seroquel makes me so drowsy I sleep 12 hours and all day I feel this grogginess like a zombie almost and Ive only been at 50 mg 25mg. I feel calm and relaxed but it feels like my body is so slow. So Im just worried that this medicine isnt really for me and just another med that will make me lose my mind. I just dont know what to feel or if Im bipolar or just depressed and all this makes my head spin and Feel even more hopeless. ,Bipolar
45454,Do you still get depressed even when stabilised? As bipolar is a degenerative disorder as much as I hate to believe it do you still get depression is your memory cognition getting worse even when you're stabilised. I can't even think for crap. Meds have made me crap. ,Bipolar
45678,Some tips to save on Latuda I keep seeing a ton of posts about how expensive Latuda is for people and of course many posts about how helpful it has been. I must say for myself it has been helpful with the depression but its certainly not a fix all for me. So with that I wanted to share some tips of what I have encountered along the way with trying to afford and stay on this medication. There are some options or relief available. Not sure I'd call them solutions but instead kind of bandaids. Ultimately it wont get better until generics come out but from what I have read it doesn't look like the patent will run out till like 2026 or thereabouts.When you get the script from the doc make sure to ask about samples if they are not provided first off. I got lucky and I have to say I was on this med for probably a good 3 months just on samples alone. Perhaps my practice is a bit more forgiving on that front. I told them I had problems with getting the cost which I did so they gave me more samples to hold me over till payday. There were also times I ran out before the pharmacy could get an order in and in which case they gave me samples to hold me over till I could get filled. Get the discount card!!! It says pay as little as 15 which for me brought my cost down to 150. Not great but far less than what it was. Latuda copay Assistanthttpssecure.latuda.comsecurelatudasavings.cfm. Check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. Unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. Some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. For me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about 1300US. Check if you have a prescription deductible. I did and at the beginning of every year it renews. So I was surprised to find that my drug I was getting for 150 was now ringing up at 400. Sadly the only way past this is to pay it. But once paid my cost was back down. McKesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost. That is right FREE. Just today I got my second free 14day supply of latuda. Call them up at 18555LATUDA and you can speak to a rep to get this. They will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card. Lastly I was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. I'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as I have not yet attempted to go this route. This will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. In order to do this you would call the same number above 18555LATUDA and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance costpay. I only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so I called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did before transferring me to another. Anwyays hope this helps some of you. The preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. Its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. Edit Looks like the patent does expire on July 2 2018. So perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.,Bipolar
45993,Medication Frustration Triiger warning mentions suicide and ED long I am new here 36 f and have commented some but this is my first post. I started a little over four years ago to try and find some relief from all the bad things going on in my mind. The only other time I had been to a Dr to help with my ongoing mental issues was when I was 22 and in college. A GP prescribed me Zoloft and up the dosage a couple times and then basically didn't schedule any follow up appointments. I basically went full out party mode and made terrible decisions lacked impulse control and was hyper sexual and engaged in a lot of risky behavior that I am still embarrassed about even today. I eventually stopped taking the zoloft after about a year because my ex found out I was taking it and he said I had no right to be depressed because my life wasn't that badhe was very emotionally abusive. My father was bipolar and we lost him to suicide and my sister is also bipolar. I had no idea that antidepressants alone could trigger a hypomanicmanic episode in some one with bipolar.I knew that there was always something not right with me I would have terrible bouts of depression. I attempted suicide at 14 luckily it didn't work I just screwed up my stomach and I never told my parents. My family never talked about emotions. I didn't even know my dad was bipolar until after his death. My mom said he never believed it and refused to take medication for bipolar. Fast forward to about four years ago I break down and tell my husband that I can't take it anymore and need help. I never admitted it to him but I had a plan for suicide and it scared the shit out of me. On the outside my life seemed great married to my husband who is amazing and the love of my life we have two healthy kidsI also have an older children from my previous relationship and I am a stay at home mom which is something I really wanted. I had extreme anxiety and depression though. I started seeing a therapist who eventually said I needed to see a psychiatrist because I most likely needed meds because my issues were not going to be resolved with therapy alone. I started meds and did an inpatient program for Eating Disorders because I had an existing ED and felt myself falling back into old bad habits in order to deal with my anxiety. The ED treatment was great but my depression and anxiety were still out of control. I told my psychiatrist back my past with zoloftI was finally realizing my behavior while taking it was probably caused by being on it alone. We tried a few antidepressants and they all made me feel irritable or angry. My Dr then starts adding mood stabilizers and antipsychotics to the mix. I look up more on bipolar disorder and start to think that maybe what's wrong with me especially with my family history. I ask my Dr if she thinks I am bipolar and she says no because I don't have any type of hypomanicmanic episode and says she changed my diagnosis to mood disorder. We try a bunch of different combos either they don't work or the side effects are so bad I can't handle them. All things she is prescribing me is medication for bipolar disorder. After three years she then starts prescribing me things I already tried and didn't work the first time. I got a new Dr. The new Dr asks right away if my old Dr thought I was bipolar after I give her the list of meds I have already tried. I see her a couple times and she says she thinks I am bipolar and my extreme attacks of anxiety that come along with not sleeping and being paranoid and suicidal are episodes of dsyphoric hypomania. I am now on my third med change with this Dr. All together I have been on 30 different meds in a little over 4 years. I am so frustrated. I am always med compliant I really want something to work. I was just on Fetzima and lamotrigine. I am so irritable and can't sleep. So my Dr took me off the Fetzima because she thought it was what was causing me problems I think it might be the lamotrigine. She said it was unlikely but I had the same trouble with Vraylar and Rexulti. I am now on the lamotrigine oxcarbazepine and mitrazapine. It's been a week off Fetzima and I am still extremely irritable and not sleeping well. Sorry about the life story. I am just so frustrated and want something to work but I feel like I am starting to run out of options.,Bipolar
45776,Saw a new psychiatrist and I am livid First sorry for formatting. Im on mobile. So today I went and saw a new doctor because I felt my last one wasnt listening to what I was saying and I left there feeling worse than when when I went in. I told her as much of my history as I could remember. Answered honestly all the questionnaires she handed me told her about my trip to the hospital even my recreational drug use. At the end she pretty much told me she didnt believe me. She asked that when I see her again to bring in a family member so she can verify my behavior in the past. I wouldnt mind that IF 1 I hadnt been on different medications for over 6 years 2 if I hadnt been diagnosed for over 4 years by 2 different doctors. She then took my regular prescription and said to take 13 of what I was taking and no mood stabilizer. I can see if she was suspicious if I came in looking for harder medication but she doesnt even prescribe any of that! I dont understand why she would completely invalidate my past history. Im sorry this is so long Im just in complete disbelief. ,Bipolar

46135,Sigh I have a pretty good life. I'm married to my amazing husband I have a wonderful daughter and I've been at my job for a long time over 15 years. So why is it that I am always looking for something bad to happen? I feel I don't deserve the good I have so when is the bad going to happen? Is this a symptom of my bipolar? It seems to be the one symptom my meds cannot control. Every day I worry my husband will wake up and see I'm not as wonderful as he says he is or my daughter will just hate me or my boss will fire me or even my pets won't want anything to do with me. Why can't I just accept all I have and not look for things that are or make things wrong? When I get like this I start fights so that I can say see bad things are happening. How lame is that?? Is this normal? Lots of things make me happy but the happiness is always replaced with fears of something going wrong and this makes me feel so guilty. I'm not looking for happiness. I have it. I'm looking for something to be wrong so things feel normal inside my head. ltSighgt,Bipolar
45909,Newly diagnosed need to vent. Any advice welcome My psychiatrist thinks Im bipolar II. I struggled with depression for over 5 years but it was always manageable. Ssris seemed to help. Then last summer they suddenly stopped working I had my first hypomanic episode and everything seems to have changed. This illness feels like such a heavy burden everyday and I have virtually no coping mechanisms. I had to give up alcohol and weed as I was becoming dependent on the former and the latter started bringing on paranoia and psychotic episodes. Im in my last semester of undergrad and seriously dont know how Ill make it to completion. I have to write a thesis which as you may imagine is like fighting the final boss in a video game that I dont even want to play. On top of my other schoolwork Im just not sure how to hang on. My psychiatrist has suggested inpatient care but if I dont finish school this semester I wont be able to afford to go back my financial aid will run out. This disease is new for me and Im scared. I feel that if I can somehow power through the last two months of this semester I can then truly seek proper help for my condition. Anyone have any words of advicestrategies to just power through the illness for a period of time? I started lithium about one month ago Im still on a small amount of citalopram and now on klonopin because I cant sleep. Sorry for the wall of text but Ive been lurking here for a while and this community seems pretty supportive and I just need to share with someone. My SO is good at listening and caring but shes also busy with her schoolthesis and I dont want to always burden her.

46387,Latuda? Thoughts? Ive been through abilify that caused anxiety seroquel which made me groggy and most recently zyprexa which made it impossible for me to wake up. Prior to all of these I was only on lamictal and Wellbutrin which had been working well until a hypomanic episode this summer. I begged my doctor to take me off of zyprexa which he did reluctantly. He mentioned Latuda. Has Latuda worked well for anyone. Your input is appreciated. ,Bipolar

45600,Anyone with bipolar disorder have family members that are Undiagnosed and in denial about being bipolar? I have Bipolar disorde type 2 with basically every anxiety disorder. My dad's side of the family basically all have anxiety disorders but have not acknowledged they may have a problem and need to be formally diagnosed as far as I know. My father for sure has a problem as he has been in the hospital many times throughout my life with Atrial Fribulation thats resulted when he's under a lot of stress.My mother is the one I'm not sure may have Bipolar disorder or some kind of disorder. Her mood is up and down where one day she'll be absolutely vicious and will find a way to be verbally vicious to anyone around her. Of course to her family she will be meaner but to friends she'll just make snarky remarks. And then maybe the next day she will be so sweet and just the best mother I could ever ask for. Her and I will get into pretty bad fights where we have even been violent and I'm not proud of it but she gets so mad over a mistake I've made and then I can't take it anymore and we will get into a fight of course it's 99 percent of the time just verbal abuse. I'm in my 20s and it's embarrassing that this is still happening but I've noticed a patters her and my grandma are the same way. What do you guys may think this is? Any help,Bipolar
46315,I lost my reason today. Whenever I'm in a deep depression with suicidal ideation I can always justify people moving on after I'm gone. My three main reasons I struggled to justify are my dogs and my cat. Recently I've been justifying the dogs too. They're a bonded pair they love my husband and he could care for them if I was no longer here. But there was one reason I couldn't justify. My cat Georgie. Georgie hates every person except me. He's also asthmatic and requires medication that he would only let me administer. If I left him behind how would he survive without his medication? He'd be alone. I took him to the vet this morning after he was still struggling to breathe even after his asthma meds. The vet came in and said heart failure. I decided the best option was to let him go. I held him as they administered the medication and until I felt him go limp. I get his ashes back in a couple of weeks. My reason is gone. And I want to go too.,Bipolar
45687,Im new Im new to this subreddit but Im very grateful to be here ! Im 21 I got diagnosed as manic depression type 2 in October. Previously I was missed diagnosed with depression and general anxiety. Ive been on and off the same medication since I was 16. Its currently not working so Ive had to take a break again to try something new. Im currently coming out of this depression part of my cycle. Usually the hypomania comes next because Im so stressed out about how hard I fucked up whatever happened in the 34 weeks of depression. I struggle a lot with trying to cope self harm. I use to cut for almost two years when I was in high school which was be main reason I got on medication to begin with. Throughout the years 1621 Ive gone on a few binders. When I was younger it was MDMA amp alcohol when I became older it was alcohol. But was all stopped by the fact that I was pregnant. My kids have been the only reason why I havent slipped back into drugs or alcohol. Im currently in outpatient treatment I guess you would call it that. I go see two doctors to talk and sort out my feelings and try and find a program fitting for me. This has been the hardest fight of my life. I thought this was over but after I had my son it creeped right back for revenge. I had him in 2016 and Ive basically missed half of his life because I dont remember from being so depressed or my anxiety. Im in this place in my life now where I dont even know where I am at everyday waking up. I feel like I dont have a path anymore. Ive lost focus in my career right now Im trying to pull myself back into this but I cant. Im mentally so exhausted I just feel useless. I fight so hard everyday to keep myself alive and calm and then my two kids all alone. I choose to put myself here and I constantly wish I didnt. I wish I could have given them a better start or a better life currently. I have a job interview Wednesday on Valentines Day. This is the first job Ive gone to since October when I tried to kill myself. I left a job after one orientation because it was a trigger to me basically. I had to hold myself back from saying things or doing things to this crazy woman who I found out lied about having cancer. I hold hope for this job I hope this can change my routine into something healthy and I can actually enjoy going to work again. I miss life I miss being able to enjoy life I just miss me. ,Bipolar
45531,That burning passion... I'm sitting here in my living room watching the log in my fireplace slowly burn. There's something oddly therapeutic about this and I'm not exactly sure what.I was an angry kid. Just... I was BAD. There was so obviously a problem but not one they could really do anything about. You can't really help a kid whose primary problem is thinks everyone wants to hurt him. Doctors tried to fit me into these neat little diagnostic labels even though nothing ever really fit. They tried to give me all these medications even though nothing ever really worked. And when I only got worse this only confirmed my original hypothesis.I'm still angry. At a society that doesn't believe victims of child abuse sexual assault violence... ANYTHING. I'm angry that I was given such a rough hand. Some might call this a sense of entitlement whatever that means Other people have it worse! said the betteroff person. But... fuck. I'm not demanding anything other than wanting to stay alive.I know what I need to do. I need to find a psychiatrist. A therapist. Probably a medication change. I've just been dealing with so much shit in my life that I've completely neglected my mental health. I've pretty much destroyed myself just trying to survive. Because I've been doing it all on my own and it's just... too much right now.A few years ago I heard someone describe anger as a motivating force. I never understood this. To me anger has only been a force of destruction... not unlike fire. If my anger is a small spark my brain's reaction to feeling it is the equivalent of dousing it with gasoline.Yet kept in a small confined area with a watchful eye a fire can keep you warm. It can be a light in the dark. It serves a purpose. Fuck sometimes it's just beautiful. And if I have a choice I'm not going to freeze to death or live my life in the dark.I didn't even know where I was going with this post when I started. Strange how you can find meaning in everything around you.,Bipolar
45744,Someone in my life's illness has got much worse. I'd like to know what to expect HiI was involved with someone's life for a long time. This person was diagnosed with Bipolar with serious manic episodes and treated for about 13 years. The meds were hard to take and she was a bit up and down with them. There were some serious manic episodes that led to dangerous situations. There was little I could do but I did help keep her on track and try to keep her honest with the meds.I realise that it must be so awful to have to take dulling medication and I'm really sympathetic to how these manic events and dropping off Lithium built up. I don't want to sound judgemental.Fast forward to now. As of three years ago I no longer have any influence or connection but have stepped in to help in a really bad episode. It's become clear that she has not really taken her medication seriously for three years. She's been totally freewheeling. The illness I saw in her recently was very different to what I knew from before. I had seen her as driven and worked up but her moods were cycling from extremes within minutes. It was frightening.I have read up as much as I can on bipolar and rapid cycling. I get the picture that some people advance towards this after every major episode and that it tends to be progressive and not go back to being a single flavour at a time so to speak.Can anyone who has experienced bipolar progressing like this in yourself or in a loved one give me a perspective? I'm concerned that she's progressed past some kind of horizon and things are going to be harder for her even on Lithium now. Just a gut feeling.I would appreciate hearing relevant experiences. Thank you. Keep up the fight guys you're all doing great in this forum.,Bipolar
46237,How much value do you place on having sex? I've been realizing that my hyper sexuality has affected how much value I put on having sex. When I was growing up I used to put so much priority on having sex. It would constantly be on my mind and I would feel like I was missing out on such a massive part of existence if I wasn't able to regularly have it. Haha that sounds so dramatic.The older I get though the more I realize that the importance I was putting on sex is mostly based on the emotions created by the maniahyper sexuality. When I step back for a moment and stop listening to my emotions and look at it logically I don't really care as much about it. I put more value on nonsexual intimacy like snugglingholding handssleeping together and the most value on having a verbal connection with someone where we can comfortably share our deepest fears and darkest secrets.Its confusing because my feelings and even my thoughts can be so drastically influencedmanipulated by the chemical reactions going on in my brainbody. So there are times where sex seems like the ultimate high. Then other times where I choose to not base my actions on achieving highs and chasing feelings and instead I do things that align with the values I have built over years based on logic and philosophy.How do you value sex do you base a lot of your actionsdecisions around it? Or maybe it just seems like a bonus to being alive but doesn't matter much? Do your feelings on it drastically change based on your mental state?,Bipolar

I didn't actually find out about my diagnosis until last year because my parents worked really hard to conceal it from me.

I don't really want to turn this into a nsfw thread unless it can't be helped but how do you ever cope with this? I'm a severe pornography addict to the point where I can't function if I don't get my daily fix I have painful shaking fits and the like. It's been like this since I was 11.

I turn 50 tomorrow. Half of my life is gone wasted...on being on disability sick unproductive contributing zero to this world. For 50 LONG years!Ive tried volunteering twice in the past year...neither ended up working out. I also have PMDD so I feel I hardly get any well time for any length of time! I have no friends. Ive either cut toxic folks out or have been very inappropriate during times of instability and never get forgiveness even after heartfelt apologies. I have two kids. One wont talk to me anymore though he has his own problems my daughter does talk through infrequently. So Im totally alone. My new AD is just starting to help a little. But 50 is hitting me so hard. I want to at least go back to school to learn a trade that doesnt involve being surrounded by several people. But I cannot think of anything Id like and that I can learn somewhat easily. 27 shock treatments later my memory is shot. So learning will be difficult no matter. Sorry for the negative introduction.

45981,How does lamictal help for you guys? Hi guys I've just recently discovered that I believe I have bipolar ii disorder and I've started the process of getting treated. I've made an appointment with a psychiatrist which I will be seeing next month and in the meantime I've been researching medications. One particular one I've been interested in is lamictal. It seems perfect for me since I suffer more from bipolar depression as opposed to mania plus it doesn't seem to have as worrisome side effects as lithium. For those of you on lamictal what kind of symptoms did you have in order for your doctor to prescribe it? And does it work well for you? ,Bipolar

46064,could i actually be bipolar? I've been diagnosed with OCD at 14 ADHD 19 Social Anxiety 19 and Depression 14ish though I had struggled with all of these since I was a kid but got worse at puberty. I was on Luvox from when I was 14 til 18 I'm 20 now just for OCD and it had a moderate effect on that sort of helped with my mood but barely touched my social anxiety but I was stableish. Anyways a year ago I went back after stopping the luvox because my symptoms all came back really bad with OCD and my depression and the doc pointed out the other issues too. And I was given a Zoloft prescription but I didn't take it for several months until everything became unbearable. I ended up stopping it after a week though because I think I became a little manic almost when I took it I had barely any sleep full of energy I was talking really fast which is an achievement when I already talk fast I felt amazing though my head felt like it was about to explode and then I started to worry that I was going to bite my tongue off that was OCD and then I became like scarily numb and I stopped taking it because I was freaking out.Point is the past year my OCD is much better and I have been in therapy for it but my depression has just gotten worse I had an episode at uni and then I dropped out and I got better when I started fixing my social anxiety and met a guy then after I broke up with a guy my depression came back worse than ever and when I was on Luvox I got depressed but these days I have a lot more suicidal thoughts and urges to hurt myself which are becoming more and more frequent so I'm going to ask for some antidepressants when I get my ADHD prescription refilled she has said several times she wants to prescribe Lexapro but I refused.Anyway I was remembering what happened when I started the zoloft and I had read that when people with diagnosed bipolar take antidepressants it can trigger an episode. My question is is it possible that I do have bipolar and I've just mainly been depressed or can meds trigger that even if you aren't bipolar? I'm just a little worried I don't want to fuck up my life any further than I have and I just needed to ramble a bit. Sorry it's so long and confusing to read,Bipolar
46351,Does your depression start similar to this Hi all so I think I have been misdiagnosed as just depression. I have a serious question can you be basically feeling okay and just one thing starts the downward spiral? I was good over the holidays and then my daughter canceled our New Years Days plansit seriously started me on a suicidal depression. Then I somehow pulled myself out and three days ago my son got annoyed with me asking him if he knew where his brother was...no fight or anythingjust annoyance in his answer to me. Then I went down again this time is worse. Actually have wondered about hospitalization. The ONLY THING I am functioning at is my jobcause I have to. If BP is chemical is it impossible to be set off by one little thing? Thanks ahead for your answers.,Bipolar
45929,Abilify is scaring me So recently I was 'diagnosed' by a psychiatrist. I see a psychologist these days we really just talk about things and I don't find that particularly helpful. I swing between horrible depression and even worse panic attacksspells of psychosis. I used to drink to 'level' myself out but in the past 4 years that really hasn't helped things and just made the psychosis worse. Also my current gf has a flat 'no drinking' policy.Anyway after 6 months being on the waiting list at the ONLY place my GP would refer me too I was given a 1 hour assessment and a script for abilify. I have a long LONG history of eating disorders along with the alcohol abuse. This past 13 months I have gone from being a happy 78kg I'm 6ft 2 to a huge 115Kg because I don't have my crutch of alcohol anymore.I'm scared of abilify. I just took my first dose. I'm terrified of the weight gain. When I was 16 I was put on seroquel and I blew up like a baloon which STARTED my crippling ED bullshit. I told all this to my psych and he assured me that Abilify was 'completely side effect free' and 'weight neutral' but my pharmacist was flabbergasted and told me I could expect a similar trail to Seroquel?So toss the meds and get a second opinion? Or is it not as scary as all that? Can anyone tell me they've had ANY positive experiences with atypical antipsychotics? ,Bipolar

45411,Partner struggling with depressive episodes Hi Everyone I have a partner who struggles with depressive episodes where he selfisolates and will completely disappear meaning will go to entirely different cities. He is on medication is very consistent with taking it and regularly attends counselling. He is so wonderful to actively work towards his goals and uses this isolation as a way to not subject anyone to any pain that he may cause them. Although I am well aware selfisolating is a way that he manages those experiences I was wondering if anyone else had this experience with their partner and if they were able to build that trust with them for them to get their space while also staying in the same location? In terms of longevity I am concerned that these spells of radio silence and disappearing acts are not conducive to a healthy dynamic regardless of his wellintentions. I've suggested going to counselling with him and he doesn't seem to have interest in it. Any advice is greatly appreciated! ,Bipolar
45817,Has anyone here had any experience with legally taking time off high school? Hello everyone! I'm a high school student who was a month ago diagnosed with Bipolar II. I'd been having depressive episodes for about a year and a month and a half ago started experiencing manic episodes as well which was the reason why I decided to see a doctor. I'm still very early in my treatment don't yet have a psychiatrist and won't for another month or two thanks American health insurance and I've been having a really hard time coping. I've always been a very high achieving student getting straight A's every semester and doing my best not to miss school. This year however has been different. Due to my Bipolar Disorder I've now missed a month of school have had to drop 3 classes and I really don't know what to do at this point. My mental health takes top priority so I am certainly not planning on sacrificing my health and safety for school. I'm feeling really hopeless and lost and balancing school work and my illness just isn't possible anymore. I plan on going to college next year but I'm afraid that my absences and now failing grades are going to affect my ability to get scholarships. I really just need to take this year off without droppingout so I can get the help I need. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice or similar experiences. I live in New York in case that matters. Sorry for the wall of text.,Bipolar
45948,Drunk on antipsychotics All antipsychotics mess with my vision. I feel like I'm drunk. I've been on 4 different ones so far and they all do the drunk vision thing which makes me feel like I'm going to topple over when I walk since I'm so wobbly. That is no exaggeration. Well my eyes move up uncontrollably and I get double vision sometimes. My psychiatrist insists that this is from being dehydrated but that's not true. My pee is clear and always has been. So I know I'm not dehydrated.I'm just so frustrated. It takes about 6 hours to wear off.I know this vision thing is due to antipsychotics because whenever I skip my antipsychotic I don't get double vision.,Bipolar
45527,Zoloft inducing hypomaniA Hi guys. ive recently 11 days ago started the antidepressant Zoloft and it caused a hypomanic episode that lasted about 4 days. Let me just say I have never felt so great in my life. It was such a relief from depression I just can't explain it.so on the last day of the hypomanic episode at night I smoked some weed and the next day it was gone. I don't know if the weed caused that or not. My question here is do you think it would be possible to come off the antidepressants for a week then start them again so I can experience that high again? or maybe try some other AD's?Yes I understand this isn't healthy as such but I would do just about anything to experience that again. Please if you have any knowledge or ideas with regard to this I would love you forever.Thankyou,Bipolar

46119,Went on 2mg Abilify exactly 7 days ago as of today. I've gained 7 pounds. I am a 32 year old woman who was RX'd Abilify 2mg last week and began taking it a week ago today. I take it with 30mg lexapro which i've taken for several years with no weight gain at all.I am naturally very thin and always have been under weight. I have never had to worry about my weight...until now being on an AAP. I don't even own a scale and borrowed my roommate's today to find out my weight today and last week. The day I began the meds 7 days ago I was 117lbs and am now 124.5. I am still within the healthy benchmark for my height at 5'6. However given that it's only been a week and its 7 pounds that's a lot isn't it? I am excited to be a bit curvier and filled out but I worry about how unhealthy this rapid increase could be as diabetes runs in my family and I worry this medication will affect my health and metabolism negatively.This now is the ultimate incentive to exercise as i was infrequent and eat few caloriescarbs than before. I used to be someone who could eat anything and be rail thin. I'm hoping the effects of Abilify will out weigh the bad. I found that on day 5 of taking it which was this Monday was the first day I really felt like it was beginning to make me feel better. So far I find myself in a happier mood and my coworkers today told me I seem happier and asked me if something good or different happened. I didn't have an answer! I am now not scowling or irritable like I was. I am able to smile at people in my building now at work when I wasn't able to before.I'm curious to find out from other women what their weight gain has been like on Abilify. Were you able to control your weight eventually while still taking it? Or did you have to stop taking it in order to loose weight? Has anyone been able to loose weight after stopping it?,Bipolar

He is going through a hard time at present so I didn't try to defend my mental health care plan to him apart from saying how dangerous it is to come off the drugs especially cold turkey. Yet he watches a lot of Yt videos about vaccines and psyche meds and how they are bad or so they say. He has fallen for it. It is as if taking a pill for your brain is unacceptable but if it was antibiotics he would say in the same sincere manner 'you must take the full course' etc. My brother is the same.

In person and in every interaction we clicked. I never thought about their disorder unless they were isolating themselves. In which case Id reach out to them with some positive message or offer that we go do something together or share how I had felt a similar way and maybe we can grow together. These times were awesome. But recently they sent some texts that were out of character. I asked if they were doing ok which is often what I do when I notice something wrong and they took offense. I asked if they had been drinking or smoking and that made it worse. This was all through text. I stopped responding only to say I understand how youre feeling and thats it. I guess they calmed down but now Im really nervous.I had never seen that type of behavior in my friend before.

46155,xpost from rbipolarWeird experience with latuda monotherapy? Advice? Throwaway account cause i don't really use reddit i just needed some adviceI was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a month ago and started taking latuda about 20 days ago. The initial 20mg dosage gradually killed my at the time current hypomanic episode within a week which was fantastic! I also noticed some but not all depressive feelings being held at bay which was nice if not quite optimal.However I bumped up to 30mg about a week ago and 2 days after that I had a psychotic episode until the next morningI felt incredibly debilitating dissociative symptoms and I felt like my body was acting seperately from my mind in a way that was trying to kill me. I couldnt really talk and mentally I felt completely void and couldnt form a coherent thought. my experience was a lot like that of this blog post httpsblogs.psychcentral.combipolarmom201203ihadamedicationinducedpsychoticepisode. Since I have bp2 mania with that much cognitive and physical impairment isn't really normal for me.Anyways after that experience my psychiatrist recommended that I cut back to 20mg latuda which seemed to help with hypomania to some degree until the end of the college semester and we planned to experiment with med cocktails after the summer. With all this in mind I'd like to have some sort of plan going forward. Is there a safe way I can continue to ramp up my latuda dose i.e. in conjunction with a stronger antimanic agent like lithium? Or should I quit latuda and try a different drug entirely?,Bipolar

46260,Struggling to stay medicated xpost from rbipolar2 I was diagnosed a few years ago bp2 after a long depressive stage and short hypomania. Basically I have a hard time staying medicated. I recognize that it helps make the depressive and hypomanic stages more manageable and my life more livable in some ways. However there are a few things counteracting thisI sometimes get this intense urge to cuthurt myself. It's so intense that I can't focus on anything else and it makes me very irritable and frustrated. All I can think about is ripping my veins open I want it more than anything. Theyve tossed around the idea that it could be harm OCD but no therapy ERP works on it. No idea if it's that or just another facet of bipolar but it seems to get more intense and unbearable when I'm slightly affected by but not consumed by depression. This plays into wanting to stop medicating because it gets so intense that I'd almost rather be severely depressed. It's like I can't win.In a sick way I like feeling extreme emotions. I really can't describe it. I don't enjoy being severely depressed or even hypomanic and yet I want it. Even the depression.I think I deserve it. I'm not sad about deserving it either. Rather I'm angry about it. Angry about not feeling extreme emotions and instead feeling dead all the time even though I'm still experiencing rapid cycling with only sometimes less intensity.Just. I'm fucking mad. All the time. I want to flay my veins and feel all the feelings. And yet I'm sick of it all Just can anyone relate? I don't know how to fix this or if I even want to feel okay anymore. I'm waiting for a new therapist in February and I'm not hopeful that it will help. Waiting for psychiatrists appt at the end of January and I dont even know what to say.

Aren't I a random smattering of continuously altered star manufactured material simply an unlikely accident which happens to be consumed with its own importance. Why does it make sense to believe that my very own particular microspeck of cosmic trash that happens to exist at this time in this place fits into some narrative that makes sense to try to tell? Perhaps a failed Seroquel dream is simply a more accurate reflection of being. And that's how I narrative myself back into a story of a legitimate human experience with a basic grasp of high school science. Take that Serorquel. ,Bipolar
45740,Boy did I screw up Wow. Did I mess up. A little background. Diagnosed as bipolar at 18 after a difficult junior high and high school experience. Struggled throughout my early 20s and finally got my life under control by my late 20s. Met an amazing woman and got married. Managed to find a meaningful career and had a few years of amazing success. Two wonderful kids. About 4 years ago my career started going south. There are several reasons one of which was a move to different state then most of my freelance work. My wife also got very sick when pregnant with our second child and I ended up getting into a bad pattern of care taking without taking care of myself. Especially when it came to sleep. As the money stopped coming in I started selling some stocks that I owned prior to our relationship. I ended up selling almost all of it and cashing out the majority of our small but important IRA over the course of 23 years. I never shared any of this with my wife and never reported any of the money as income. Fast forward to 2017. Almost all of the stock is gone and I still havent told anyone. We are practically broke and borrowing money from family members repeatedly. A few weeks ago my wife demanded access to my brokerage account. She decided the best way to fix our finances was for her to take complete control. The jig was up. My huge violation of trust was revealed. I truly believe that deep down I am a good person. I have a good heart and I am a very caring and loving father and husband. But with my terrible actions and hiding and lying about it it is clear that I am sick and need help. I dont know what caused this manic episode but I am sure the fact that I sleep 56 hours a night so she can get a full 810 hours of sleep every day didnt help. She says she loves me but hates my guts right now. She says she loves me but is terrified and feels like unsafe. She says she doesnt know if she can stand to have me in the house or will ever be able to see me as a romantic partner again. I havent been in therapy since my psych died in 2011. Ive been seeing a nurse practitioner once every three months to keep my prescriptions up. But clearly need to find a new doctor pronto and get intensive therapy. Not just medication management. If I didnt have children I cant imagine what Id do to myself. But I love them and I love her so much. I know I have a chronic illness and this is a major flare up. I just cant imagine how I can live without my family.We are seeing a couples therapist next week. I am so ashamed of my actions and my lying. Im not sure what to do. ,Bipolar
45887,Its 10am and I dont want to get out of bed The depressive hot yesterday. Hard and fast and vicious. That thought process unneeded unwanted unremembered I was laid off a month ago. I check the job boards and nothing is even interesting. Im 40 years old never been married and dont have kids. What I do is who I am I have nobody to share my life with nobody to make working worthwhile. I want to open my own business but I need to raid my 401k to do that. I dont see the point in having a 401k when its likely I will die in my sixties. But everyone thinks its a bad idea to use my life savings to do something that interests me. If I show people the statistics of reduced life span for bipolar and they disregard it. If I only have 25ish years left why shouldnt I make it the best 25 years doing something I love? Why should I get a job that is just a job with no purpose other than to buy another day. The funny thing about starting my own store is the people who would never shop there think its a horrible idea but the people who would shop there and owners of similar shops think its a great idea challenging but great. My father literally told me to get a job as a janitor at the hospital. I want to do my own thing but Im being blocked and told to do something safe. Is anything worth doing ever safe or easy? Hell no! I cant escape the working class playing it safe. If youre wondering this is the store I want to open it would be called The Basement if you think about the kids from Stranger Things and the basement they hang out in then roll that forward 56 years what do you have? A place with music and books and games all specifically tailored to what they enjoy. The store would be selling specific genre records growing at double digits dystopianspeculativescifihigh fantasy books and games like DampD and Magic and Catan and similar things. Stores that carry everything and try to cater to everyone struggle but boutique style stores serving specific markets do okay and can develop a solid customer base. But apparently having done tons of market research and knowing the product and knowing the area and what sells and having worked in retail management for years are all indicators that I should do something safe maybe I should be a get a job as a bus driver instead. ,Bipolar
46355,Finally done with Seroquel and Zoloft I know cold Turkey is so bad for you but I did it and successfully transferred to depakote and ritalin which has changed my days. I don't lay around wanting to die anymore. I don't want to eat everything in sight. And for the first time I'm organized. Seroquel 200mg is what I was taking until I started having chest pains and my clothes didn't fit anymore. 200mg zoloft fucked me up worse than anything. Especially the weird withdrawal. Seroquel made me sweat like a hoe in church quitting it. I'm so glad I stuck it out because I am definitely not a good candidate for seroquel or zoloft. I feel good. Not overly emotional or depressed. I feel like me again. ,Bipolar

I feel like I'm experiencing an completely different type of mania that is like no other... it's not super intense or anything but my risk taking behaviors are like whoa right now and I don't want to stop. It all started this weekend when I was partying which I almost never do either... drank way more than usual all weekend. Ended up experimenting with recreational drugs that I always swore I would never try. And I liked it! I also went crazy sexually and did some things I'm not very proud of but still want to do it again and the opportunity is 100 being presented to me on a gold platter. Im not having any of the normal mind racing heart beating out of my chest anxiety attack ridden mania than I usually have...wtf is this crap? Any words of advice?,Bipolar

46401,Is my therapist at fault or am I being paranoid? F25. I've been seeing my M66 psychiatrist for the past 2 years and everything has been great. He's always been a very good professional and never made me feel uncomfortable. Considering that I've known how he approaches therapy for 2 years now I find it very strange that he has suddenly changed our boundaries and without asking me. First thing is that one day instead of a good bye handshake he said I'm going to hug you today and he did so. I didn't mind goodbye hugging is very common in my culture but I don't like that he didn't ask first if that was ok instead of just announcing it and going for it. He proceeded with doing this again after every session since then. Then last time he kissed me on the cheek also common and nonsexual way to say goodbye in my culture but still strange as he's never done it before. He also called me once to check on me and ask how I was feeling I had just lost my dad so maybe that's fine but he's also never done that before all these years. Today I cancelled our next appointment because something came up and he said ok but I have to pay for it anyway which I know some therapists do but 1 mine never does and 2 I cancelled way earlier than the timespan that would require me to pay. What is going on here? Is this an approach I'm not aware of is something wrong?ampx200BTLDR My therapist of two years suddenly crossed some boundaries which he's never done before and I'm troubled. ,Bipolar
46377,feeling down trigger warning talks about grief and mourningHi everyone! I thought I'd check in though I haven't been all that active in this community recently. By all accounts I'm doing pretty well I'm successful in my job and have settled into the city I've moved to for about a year. Starting to form some social connections and am in therapy. It's been 1 year since my last hospital visit and my symptoms are really going down. I also started following one of my passions and started writing a book about my mental health experiences.what I want to chat about is how you all keep it together when life throws you some shitty stuff? My grandma passed away recently and my family is still dealing with stuff about her passing. We were very close and I hadn't seen her in about a year since I live on the other side of the country. I ended up not going to the funeral but shared some memories that my family read. I won't get into details here but we may also sell one of her properties that was very meaningful to me growing up. Her passing also caused some tension in our family which I'm not personally involved in but still feels stressful.Then totally out of the blue another person I didn't know well but who worked with me also passed away. I can't help feeling regret about not talking to this person more and wish that I had spent more time to do that. Actually I'm feeling that about my grandma as well. Looking for any suggestions about how to keep it positive when you're dealing with tough stuff like this? I feel a lot of regret and sadness about not spending more time with these people. I also feel a little bit of disillusionment and a little hopeless just generally thinking about how our time on earth is limited. It's also wintertime so I think that's contributing too. Has anyone been dealing with anything similar or gotten through something like this?,Bipolar

Mistakes that could directly harm living creatures. But I'm afraid to come off Lamictal. It's the only thing that's ever worked like this for me without massive side effects. I had to use a week of PTO with one days notice because I had a medicine change that triggered a mixed episode. I don't know what to do. I have to work. But I feel like I'm a terrible employee.

46437,A story going from manic to depressive Bipolar II explained My eyes open. WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE. Why was I so down yesterday? Maybe I should go to the gym. No no maybe I should get some work done. Yes work Ive been neglecting work. Actually maybe I should pay rent Im a couple of days overdue. I put on my favourite song. What a great fucking song my auditory cortex shoots out musical notes like buckets of cum for my vagina of a cerebral cortex to process and enjoy. First I need to make breakfast. Whats the most optimal amount of nutrients I can make in a meal for my body weight? I research this for a couple of hours I want to know anything and everything about how nutrients work from the macro to the micro level. I order an organic chemistry book. I order a vegetable juicer. I order 5 different multivitamins and 2 fish oils. I go for a run planning my ultimate breakfast. I am so excited. I get a few hours of work done life is so fucking great. Hell maybe Ill even find a girlfriend soon. Maybe I can share this with my friends. I havent spoken to them in a while but I think it would be really great to catch up. So I plan 3 coffee dates for tomorrow. Perfect that will scratch my social itch. I also want to get REALLY fucking high. Or maybe Im just craving affection. Peaking on MDMA and having my first kiss felt identical. So does the mdma comedown and breaking up. I dont deal with relationships very well. Im either careless or obsessive. Very rarely do I find a good fit in fact I havent yet. But Ive learned from my mistakes.My thoughts start racing. Maybe Ill never find someone to give this boundless love to. Maybe Im not attractive enough. Maybe Im too weird. Who spends 4 hours planning their breakfast? Sometimes I say things I dont mean. Sometimes I just want people to like me. Sometimes I wont shut up. Sometimes friends say they like me or click well with me but it doesnt feel genuine. Are all my relationships fake? Im definitely overthinking this. This cant be true. My dad comes into my room and asks how applying to work is going I tell him to fuck off. I cant believe I just said that. Im just mentally fucked up and waiting for my meds to work this must be the case. My friends like me right? I need to slow down my thoughts this is driving me mad. I order some ket havent eaten all day and decide to order pizza. I binge and fall asleep. I wake up. The greyness of the bleak sky reflects through my cold window. I gather all my strength to go take a shower. I made it to the bathroom and undress. Ive put on weight. My brutal acne medicine isnt working as promised in fact its made it worse. Ive ignored calls from my landlord for days now theres no way I can call him and sort it out. I dropped out of school Im a fucking failure. I put on my favourite song. My auditory cortex hits me cerebral cortex with notes like harpoons to Moby Dick. What trash how can anybody enjoy music?Oh fuck I have to meet up with my friends today. I try and get myself together and make a lazy breakfast. One friend calls me and says he cant make it. Im somewhat upset but also relieved. I meet up with my other friend. We have a seemingly normal conversation but I am fucking shattered. I cant tell if he can tell or not. I leave the conversation feeling defeated Ive had so much to say and nothing but small talk left my mouth. He must think Im boring I despise being boring. I return home to find my books vitamins and juicer waiting for me in a parcel at my doorstep. Im never gonna use this shit whats the point? Ah but yes my ket arrived Ill get a couple of hours of peace completely zombified. My dad calls me when Im all fucked up. He can tell Im fucked up and hes worried Im going to overdose. I try to pretend to be sober and he tries to pretend to believe that Im sober as to not upset me more its the saddest thing in the world. He drives me to the emergency unit and I get my vitals checked all is seemingly fine. My parents have been nothing but supportive and Im still like this. My phone dies and I cant get it to work my last friend completely ghosted and in my mind gone forever. Maybe some day Ill get better Im just waiting for the meds to work. I fall asleep.I wake up WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE.,Bipolar

Looking back on life I realize how bipolar has made me act towards certain aspects and has really turned my life upside down.

45897,Boyfriend 26m diagnosed bipolar when he was 10 but Im wary of his initial diagnosis. Hes going to go see someone to get reevaluated as soon as he gets insurance. TW Suicide The more I talk to my boyfriend about his past it seems like he was demonized for having any emotions as a child and his parents were emotionally abusive and neglectful. He acted out in elementary school and attempted suicide and was sent to a psych ward where he was diagnosed. Theyre not going to see that his parents were trash and used religion to mentally abuse him and shammed him for having normal human emotionsresponses to their behavior. In the year that Ive known him hes been severely depressed with racing thoughts. Hes like your typical person with severe major depression. He has thoughts of suicide almost constantly. He claims he felt normal when he moved out of his house and hes gotten worse since being back home. Can you go an entire year or two without mania with bipolar and only have depression? His description of mania is so hard to understand that Im unsure if thats just his normal mood of being pulled out of the depression or if its truly mania that hes describing. He said a happy event will trigger it and it might last 12 days. He also has anger issues with the depression. I know depression can make you agitated and so can mania. Can you have bipolar and not have manic episodes hardly ever? Like be depressed for a whole year with no indication of mania or hypomania? Im not certain how to identify mixed episodes but hes always depressed. I know he needs to go to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and treatment but its not an option at this exact moment due to financial issues so Im just trying to learn all that I can for right now. Im trying to get the money to take him as soon as I can. I just want to learn more about this stuff and more about him in the meantime. ,Bipolar

45540,UPDATE I have a 2nd job interview tomorrow Today was a heck of a day. I applied for this radio station job last week with the expectation that I would work parttime doing the news and some office work. It's not my ideal dream scenario but it's a job in radio which I love more than anything else.I walked into the interview today and knocked it out of the park. So much so that the owner is going a completely different direction with me. He offered me a morning drive show simulcast on two of their stations. They've never done a live local show on this radio station. Like...ever.I wrote this in my initial post but getting into radio was part of my therapy and mental wellbeing. The idea was that if I did something I loved that mentallycreatively stimulated me then I would be prone to having fewer episodes and just be in a better place overall.This proved to mostly work. I was able to be creative to a point but I was still restricted by someone else's parameters. This new job would offer me the chance to build something from the ground up. It's giving me the opportunity to build my own brand. I've always looked at radio as a form of art and I've just been given a blank canvas. My wife didn't know how to handle me when I came home today. She hasn't seen me like this in over a year. My moods haven't really cycled they've pretty much been low and lower. I feel higher than I've felt in a really long time. She couldn't stop smiling and hugging me.I just wanted to share this news with someone. I've been under this dark cloud for so long and it's nice to feel good about something for once. Thanks for reading.,Bipolar

46078,My therapist thinks I may be bipolar. So I just saw a new therapist and I was describing the symptoms I experience. Back when I wasn't on medications I used to have huge highs and devastating lows. During my highs I was more confident than usual my mood was highly elevated I was more energetic and I would be excessively talkative. Every time that happened though I would experience a crash. I would become desperately depressed with suicidal ideation worthlessness etc. With each crash worse than the last. This cycle probably occurred 20 times in a span of about a year. After telling him this he said that it sounds a lot like bipolar. He's a therapist not a doctor so obviously no diagnosis. My doctor put me on Latuda along with my Zoloft and Wellbutrin. One thing I noticed about my high periods is that sometimes I would get a little giddy in the day prior to the high. I also noticed that I still needed a full night's sleep. I just sleep more when in a depression. I've wanted to stop my Zoloft because my depression persists when I'm on it and I really miss the highs I used to have. ,Bipolar
46320,I don't have Bipolar! I have a neurological disorder called Kaksisuuntainen mielialahiri. It's usually treated with the same meds they use for epilepsy. The perfect way to not freak people out if you have to tell them you are bipolar. Kaksisuuntainen mielialahiri means Bipolar in Finnish. No one I know understands Finnish and no one gives a shit enough to actually look it up. So everything in the title is technically true but it doesn't immediately invoke fear and prejudice.

I'm going on a week's vacation there in a month from now my fam and I actually chose it partially due to being seasonally affected and it's my first time traveling abroad A since 10th grade so 19 years later and B on psych meds. I am on Lamictal Wellbutrin XL Ritalin and Lunesta and I'm not keen on the idea of avoiding the hassle by going off of them for the week. I looked at the State Department and Spanish Embassy websites and they talk about letters forms export and import licenses...all of which is SO not helping my anxiety. A good friend of mine traveled there post911 and when a friend visited her there who was on psych meds she said he got hung up at customs for hours.Even after surfing multiple websites I'm not able to get exact clarity about if Ritalin is considered narcotic or controlled over there I know it's Sched II here in the US some say I need my prescriptions and a letter some say just one or the other some say it must be in Spanish and others don't...I'm probably just overthinking it or freaking out more than I should but I really just don't want any nasty surprises because I really want to enjoy my trip.

46215,How FMT cured my Bipolar 1 Disorder fecal microbiota transplant Hi all. I experimented with home FMT under the guidance of my excellent psychiatrist. It was a phenomenal success. After 18 years of hell continuous unrelenting and completely debilitating depression interdispersed with frequent psychotic manic episodes. I had been hospitalised over a dozen times and had extremely low functionality. Then in November 2016 I started home FMT. No improvement for 3 months then I experienced an exponential decrease in all my symptoms. Within 6 months I was 100 symptom free and was so well my psychiatrist agreed to take me off all medication. That was 14 months ago and I'm still 100 symptom free. No depression in any level for 19 months no mania for 14 months. My intense anxiety and social phobia has completely disappeared. My stress tolerance is still increasing. I am now a highly functioning completely well person. It was miraculous. There is currently a clinical trial underway in Canada headed by Dr Valerie Taylor of the Womens College Hospital trialling FMT for bipolar depression. My psychiatrist is soon to write my case study up in the Australian New Zealand journal of psychiatry and ill soon be featured in a feature length documentary. Here is a link to my story on Australian National TV. since then June 2017 I've also been able to lose 18kgs. The weight was a side effect of the anti psychotics I was on which I am gratefully no longer on. Targeting the microbiome to treat mood disorders is the medicine of the future... the near future. httpsyoutu.beGMjy5yEhZ5Q,Bipolar

46277,Anguish For the last three months I've been doing what I can to keep my anger and anxiety down to a minimum. Long story short I was asked to help an aquaintence with a project and when I divulged personal stories to them about things that I had guilt or fears about they decided to tell me it was my fault and then rub salt in the would be telling me I was a burden on them. I came home crushed and filled with rage and anger but mostly a feeling of guilt. Like I had done something wrong. Like maybe there was truth in their words. Logically I know there isn't. They never took the time to even listen to me and interrupted me constantly while never giving me a chance to think to respond claiming that because I had to think I was about to lie and was unsure myself. Truth is I just don't think of certain things that often. I had opened up to these people just to be kicked down and for the last three months I've been filled with an uneasy rage and panic attacks whenever I think of them which has been daily. I've done everything I know to do to get them out of my head but it only serves to strengthen the memory. I know that by giving them so much real estate in my head I'm giving them the power over me but I can't control it. I feel so hurt and now it's starting to cause severe paranoia in my normal life making me laugh or at those I trust. I feel lost helpless useless and full of guilt but lost of all I feel like it is all my fault for not being able to cope. I have a history of trauma bipolar depression and autism. I'm terrified of people and I don't know what to do anymore. I've resigned the idea of ever getting a job or of ever having a meaningful relationship. But know I wonder if having a standards life is out of the question as well. I feel like my troubles are so insignificant compared to others and that I'm just whining but I also know that just because others have it worse it doesn't invalidate my pain but yet still I feel like a waste of breathe. I'm scared. I'm so scared for my future.,Bipolar

I'm diagnosed with bipolar but I've never experienced that. My downs are major depression and I have suicidal thoughts a lot but when I'm not depressed I'm angry. Like I'm so pissed off at everything and the slightest tiny thing could trigger it and make me so mad for an hour or so and then I'll be back to normal or back to being depressed. Or I'll have a couple days or a week where I'm really pissed off and snapping at everyone around me and then it'll go away and I'll be depressed again. I've never felt that on top of the world kind of feeling that I've read about on Reddit and in doing research about bipolar. It's always anger or depression for me. ,Bipolar
45721,Health effects of longterm gt6 years use of lamotrigine? Particularly related to chronic inflammation and lowgrade flulike symptoms Hi allI've been on 250mg lamotrigine for about 6 years now. It works fantastically. However during the same period I've slowly developed a kind of background inflammation that's basically the same as very minor flu. It's there almost all the time some days better than others and is sometimes accompanied by muscle achessprains and a slightly sore throat. I also feel like I'm extra warm to the touch.No doubt the timing is purely coincidental and I have some other problem but I figured it was worth researching. Unfortunately however I can't find much about longterm usage and the only articles that refer to those symptoms are acute allergic responses.Do any of you have viewsexperiences here?

45742,little pity party I don't want to be bipolar anymore. I don't want to be on meds. It's not fair that some people are able to just exist with a stable mood amp appropriately reactive ups amp downs. It's not fair amp it makes me feel angry sometimes. I don't want anymore med changes. I don't want to live the rest of my life this way.I am depressed. I am whiny. I am pathetic. My sincere apologies. I'm actually in the process of a med change to try amp get stable. I'm just feeling really sad amp angry right now. I don't want to live this way.,Bipolar
46447,Do you guys get stressed from reading? I think it's a form of irritation. It wasn't as bad as back in high school and primary as I was able to read and do my homework without being really stressed. Unless if it's something I'm really interested in. If I was given the same work again back from high school I wouldn't be able to do it. I thought long why and I think it's because of the newly bipolar diagnosis in late adolescent. Memory problems stressed from reading! ,Bipolar
45667,After 1 year with no job I finally got one only to quit this morning after working half a shift. Im so embarrassed. After over a year of hospital stays manic episodes and what not I finally felt well enough to apply for a job at a salon I have been going to and I was hired the same day! I was so proud and excited! I told my friends and family and my sister even took me out for drinks to celebrate.Then came Monday and it was just a training day. My anxiety got the best of me and didnt sleep at all Sunday night but I think I did well on Monday except for a few times I think I talked way more than I should have and possibly said some stupid shit. So then I was scheduled to work again today. I havent slept this entire time Im manic and have had 3 panic attacks. Im obviously not ready yet and I feel like such an asshole for even trying. I sent a stupid long text to the girl that hired me apologizing but basically saying I cant do it. So I sit here typing this and crying my eyeballs out because I failed again and feel like I really am letting people down. Again. Setting up a therapy appointment as soon as they open this morning...Edit I dont think you guys will ever know how much your words of encouragement mean to me. Im crying again but this time from thankfulness. ??,Bipolar

46442,Job interview tomorrow Been ununderemployed for a couple months now after an incredibly highstress and highreward contract ended side note it was an entire year and I managed to do it without taking a mental health day the entire time!. It opened a lot of doors for me including for the job that I'm interviewing for in the morning... But it's not a job that I necessarily want. It'll look good at a resume and will get me a step further in the direction I want to go but I'm worried it'll come around and bite me in the ass later too. I'm worried my mental health will flare up and shit'll go sideways like it usually does and I'll end up burning everything down and making it a flaming road block instead of a bridge to where I want to be. And if I get an offer they will want me to commit to 24 years there... and I've only managed to hold down a job for 2 years once before and it was a shitshow towards the end.I've been in a depressive episode for the last few weeks and I'm worried that the interview won't go well. And if it does go well I'm worried about the job. Sigh. I just need to get a good night's sleep and go into it with as good a frame of mind as I can. None of it matters right now and I don't need to make a decision until I have an offer anyway I just can't help but stress about it. Thanks for reading and supportive words are welcome. Please and thank you. ,Bipolar

My depression is persisting so on Monday my doctor is going to talk to me about adding something like Abiifity.Has anyone ever reached the therapeutic dose and have it not work?

I'm extra irritable and my mood has been kind of volatile. Last week my long distance bf and i broke up. He was cheating on me and I've been really upset. I can't tell if what I'm feeling is normal or if it's a side effect of this disorder. I don't know if i should go up on my medications or ride this out. Does anyone have any advice or have felt anything similar? ,Bipolar

The absolute nothingness of depression is the worst feeling a person can experience to not even be able to be sad is tragic. Sometimes I want to feel sad so I can feel something. I look at death and illness so I can try to feel something for someone. Every thing is pointless now. I want my purpose back. ,Bipolar

I'm constantly stressed I want to die just so I don't have to keep going to that hell hole just to survive. I've been looking for a new job and so far no call backs.I've taken to drinking to numb everything I'm so anxious all the time it feels like I'm on a never ending rollercoaster.I have diagnosed bipolar type 2 and general anxiety disorder that I am not currently medicated for but I can't get myself to just call around to get in to a doctorI promise I will not kill myself but I can't stop thinking about just dying to escape. I fantasize about natural disasters wiping out my town daily. I want a nearby volcano to blow or a meteor to hit me.My house is a disaster I can hardly bathe more than once a week pretty proud of myself for actually keeping my teeth brushed more often than not recently I just hope I hit a manic episode soon just for a break from this depression but I don't think that's going to happen until I get a new job.If you've made it this far thank you for reading my rambling.,Bipolar

My two good grades are artsy classes artpiano. I have to retake bio if I fail it and cant at least get it to a C so theres a bunch of money burnt that I dont have.

I have no plan for my life my meds aren't working and everyone keeps telling me to push on and keep fighting. I'm just so tired of fighting though. My mom tells me things will get better but I just don't see it happening. Anytime I pick myself up and get better and I eventually fall even lower than the last time. I tell her what happens when I'm 50? 60? I'll still have to get up in the morning and take medicines I hate and live my life as a lie to stop everyone around me from feeling bad. I know I should check into a hospital at some point but now isn't the right time so I'll just continue to be a sad loser. ,Bipolar
45505,New to Risperdal do side effects subside? I'm 27 years old and was just diagnosed with bipolar type II after Prozac treating what they thought was depression sent me into a psychotic episode. I was diagnosed with major depression amp generalized anxiety disorder at 12 years old and just coasted on Wellbutrin XL amp Celexa until college then cut back to just Wellbutrin XL in college until about a month ago. I haven't been depressed in at least a year but my anxiety has been out of control for many years. The psychiatrist at the hospital was convinced the anxiety is a manifestation of hypomania and put me in Risperdal 0.5mg twice a day. I started it 4 days ago and take it in additional to Wellbutrin.Anyway enough about that. My dose of Risperdal is very low at 1mg a day and I still feel like a metaphorical zombie. My brain is in a fog and I can barely stay awake. I'm terrified of driving or working like this. No general anxiety though! Thankfully I don't notice an increase in appetite either.If you took Risperdal did early symptoms go away after a while? I'm just a little disturbed because it's such a low dose and I'm already feeling like this. The psychiatrist eventually wants to maybe bump me up to 2mg a day but if that's gonna make me feel even more like this I don't know if I'd be able to function. I'm willing to stick with it if it'll make my outofcontrol anxiety manageable at some point but I'm a bit skeptical if these side effects will continue as long as I'm on it.,Bipolar

45734,As experts in psychiatry what do you think about my sex life? The last year has been chaotic but the next is looking stable and positive. The next priority is going to be repairing my bond with my husband. I basically shut down to emergency mode for a few months due to job loss and massive anxiety. Hubby took excellent care of me and the household during that time. Unfortunately as I was coming out of it he was heading into a pretty hefty depression. All of this on top of some asyetunresolved body image issues developed no pun intended from my wedding pictures. I've been worried and I think hubby too that we've wandered into platonic territory and I really want to reel that back. Hubby's depression is currently covering the fact that I'm having a hard time reengaging with him but I think the problem is mine because of my reaction to the wedding photos making me feel extremely unsexy rather than being createdcaused by him. Any ideas about how to feel sexy again? ,Bipolar

45592,Medication adjustments I'm frustrated . 22F Bipolar 2. I need a rant . I'm in college. I struggled with schooling my entire life I guess for the simple fact that things don't hold my attention or interests for long. Pair that with depression and random hypomania anxiety and well... nothing good. I dropped out of hignschool but got my vrade 12 and now I'm trying to better myself . While I'm doing better than before due to medication it's still a struggle. Back in February 2017 I made the hard choice to see my doctor and have a referal put in to see a psychiatrist . Since I live in a shitty area we have one fly in once every so often. So when I seen him he put me on lamotragine and said that was the issue at hand to be dealt with first then we would see what the next point of action would be ADHD depression anxiety. Since I've been doing well with anxiety he suspected ADHD would be next and seemed to think I would be able to notice after the dose was increased a few times. Fast forward to today. I'm on 150mg of lamotragine clonazepam as needed when I get aggressive panic attacks etc. I was leveled out for months at 125mgs but had a checkup for refills back in October where my family doctor increased them because the psychiatrist wanted to see about getting me up to 300mgs. Since it was what the psychiatrist wanted family doctor wanted to keep increasing to see what the differance is... I was hesitant because I'm in school I don't want to jeopardize anything and this dosage I was on was tried and true as far as I was concerned. After telling him how I felt he said your feeling good now maybe you could be feeling better so... benefit of the doubt I did as I was told. Yesterday I had another appointment. I went in figuring it was the usual routine. Told him I couldn't concentrate I was feeling distracted often and easily and my interests were shifting pretty often so I was concerned. I asked to see the psychiatrist again to talk about ADHD since that's what was suggested before and seems to be what I'm dealing with. I was told WE DONT HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.... BUT would very soon and I would have a referral put in to see himher for when we do and they visit. Awesome right? So now he wants to lower my dosage back to 125mgs to see the difference which is the same shit I was told when he increased it to 150mgs. I don't want to do that. I'm uncomfortable possibly distressed about the thought of it altogether since I'm so sensitive to these things. I can't afford a hypomanicdepressive spiral right now not while I'm in school... so I'm thinking I'll just keep my dosage until I see another psychiatrist.... FML,Bipolar
45668,Abilify Maintena So I'm currently on Abilify 30mg and I'm kind of interested in switching because I like the idea of just getting one shot every month instead of pills everyday.

Im teetering on the edge of a massive down at the moment while my pills even out just upped dosage and alongside the other crap I always get really bad problems with my hands and coordination. I feel like I cant close my hands properly as if all the heaviness goes into them and when I try to concentrate on them they just go shaky. My shrink says its a normal symptom of depression lack of coordination which is fine my problem is that Im a piano teacher and every time this happens it makes it almost impossible to demonstrate exercises for my students or convince them that good technique pays off. Not to mention I keep droppingbreaking things. Has anyone found a way to work around this? It doesnt help me to have proof that Im uselessbad at my jobclumsy when Im in a down and like I said Im definitely heading there this weekend. Thank you xxx Edit I should have said this is a symptom that I had before I started taking lamictal but I agree that it could have made it worse. ,Bipolar
46390,New Meds...and i'm nervous. Weening on Lithium. Long Well i've been on the Lithium train for almost 2 years now but unfortunately its started to give me painful cystic acne. I've never had acne problems before even in high school. i would get maybe one zit every once in awhile. So having this acne suddenly for no reason was affecting my self confidence a lot. Not only that Lithium was also severely affecting my short term memory so after much deliberation My pdoc has decided to ween me off.Here's where it gets scary to me. I haven't had a med change since February of 2017 besides a few Lithium tweaks here and there. I've been pretty stable for months and my blood tests have been alright. But...I'm terrified of going back on the roller coaster. This med change was somewhat needed. I have been hallucinating a lot. i hear voices see things that aren't there etc. I've also been so paranoid to the point i dont leave my house much other than work and back. I refuse to go to a store and i refuse to go out anywhere in public where there's people because i'm convinced they are going to kill me. sigh. anyways its gotten pretty bad so she's started me on Risperdone a.k.a Risperdal and something to help me sleep Restoril Temazepam.I'm mostly nervous to come off of Lithium and i would appreciate any advice from people that have. Will I need to watch my moods extra carefully? what were withdrawals like?and my next questions anyone have any experience with Risperdone and Temazepam? Thank you in advance lt3,Bipolar
45702,Can lithium stop working? I am currently on lithium and lamictal. Lithium changed my life and I would never stop taking it. Lately my mood has been dipping down and I've been thinking some troubling things. I don't want to end my life but it feels like my brain wants to. I have an amazing life with plenty of supportive family. I have two small children that I would never want to hurt by hurting myself. But the thoughts are there. Constantly now. I use all the DBT and CBT skills I have learned. Part of me just wants to die and I don't know why.How do you deal with this? I'm afraid to speak to anyone because it ends up in hospitalization. Has anyone else on lithium experienced this? It's been a god send of a drug and now I'm sad it'll stop working. I'm hoping it will just pass but it feels so deep.Anyone else have experience or advice? I feel so lost.,Bipolar
45969,Disengaging from my friends Fuck. Fuck man. I feel like shit. I feel like I'm pushing away the people who can help me the most because I feel like a drama queen and I feel like I am a burden to them and I feel embarrassed because I don't want to make a spectacle of myself.We have a weekly game night on Thursdays. Last night I really wanted to bail I left work half an hour late and the day started off shitty but my friend asked if I could bring him a sixer of something and I'm always there for my friends when they need me. So I snagged it and showed up. Felt flighty left an hour in when I realized I just couldn't people anymore.Cried the whole way home. Depressed as fuck.I don't want to change my meds right now. Last time I changed them I got real fucked up. I'm on Lamictal 150s. I close on a house in three weeks and I'll have a real bed instead of sleeping on a pull out couch. I won't be in direct contact with my family constantly. Gaslighting. Halfapologies. It's frustrating.I think I'm not sleeping enough. It's been this way for 8 months now. 9 months. I just need a good nights sleep maybe I should get a hotel for a couple of days just to get some fucking sleep finally. But honestly I don't want to spend the money when I'm close to getting the house. I'll need to buy out fuel pay for utilities amp cable 'installation' even tho I have my own modem and my first mortgage payment is 18 days after closing. It feels tiring.Like I'm not stressed about the house. At all. My mother is. She picks at it like 'I don't think you're going to like the commute' 'Are you picking out the shingles for the roof? No? That's a mistake.' 'You can't put a roof on in winter.' And she was stressed about it for me in the beginning because she thought it was a 2 bedroom house even though I sent her the listing that showed it was a 3 bedroom. And she was stressing ME out where I had all my shit in order.I've had all my shit in order so much that I haven't had to gather paperwork or do anything for the past 3 and a half weeks. I've been twiddling my thumbs just waiting.And I texted a couple people from game night who haven't texted me back. And I'm stressed about it. And I'm worried they all collectively decided I was crazy and to stop talking to me because that's what I tell myself when I'm depressed that I'm useless and a burden and everyone would be better off without me.Even my friend who I was supposed to babysit for on Saturday hasn't gotten back to me. I feel so alone and I feel like I'm doing it to myself. Because I am.Edit Heard back from one friend. Still on for babysitting at least. She's awesome. People don't hate me.But I still feel crappy.,Bipolar
46003,Bipolar with social anxiety Hello!I am new here and I figured I would find a chat board that I can relate to. I've been diagnosed bipolar for over 12 years as well as ADHD PTSD trichotillomania and social anxiety. My fiance and I just recently moved and what two friends I had turned out to only want me around because I finally got my disability and had income finally. Given that I'm back to having no friends again in my community. It's painfully hard for me to talk to new people as people see me as socially awkward and just not someone to fit in anywhere. With that said I was just hoping to make a friend or friends who know what my struggle is daily with these conditions.My fiance and my dad are my friends right now but I would like some females to hang out with and talk to. My fiance and I are getting married this year in October so I am under a lot of stress and my anxiety is really high. I don't bite much tend to have a good sense of humor but I'm way to good at seeing through people. If someone's fake I know it pretty quickly which also keeps me isolated. I just want a friend. ,Bipolar
45559,How to tell when it is time to call it quits and also when it is time to try again I've got a lot going on in my life having just gotten out of my second psychotic episodehospitalization of the new year moving to a new apartment transitioning from school to Real Adult TM 95 and other adult stuff etc.I am about to start a full time internshiptemp job at an engineering firm but I am concerned about my ability to perform given that I've only recently come out of an intense episode and am not even sure if I'm out of the woods fully yet and am unable to even read a novel atm. So when do I know if it's time to work something out with HR? Do I start and wait for a disaster?On the flip side I'm applying to full time jobs following the internship. I've put the applications on hold because I'm an engineer and because of the aforementioned problems I'm really not up to technical interviews right now.So for the former when do I bail out and for the latter when do I start trying again?I guess this question is more general than the precise scenarios I listed I'll of course listen to my supporters irl but I just wanted to get the internet's perspective.,Bipolar
46039,Nostalgy rules my life Hi could you please advise me what can I do? I'm very sensitive cyclothymic person and I have terrible problem with accept changes and tranzisions in life. I'm so attached to so many animals people and places... I worry about their health all the time. My imagination is so catastrophic. I have also thanatophobia. Because I'm sensitive and allergic to meds I am looking to some others ways to cope with that. I really think my most meaningful life is in the past. I love to write and my text are almost always about passing and are so depressive. I don't seem depressed maybe mildly but my huge triggers are connected with this vulnerability to change.

45666,Industrial Design for Bipolar stability Im a student studying industrial design and currently working on a research projectdesigning a product that will help people with mental illness specifically bipolar disorder. I came here to get some more insight!I was inspired by a severe manic episode my dad just experienced in December and also by my own diagnosis of Bipolar 2. Essentially I want to create a product that will maintain routine promote stability and possibly warn the user and their support group when intervention might be necessary. Ive been looking at wearable technology like Fitbit and smart watches and also at mental wellness apps that track mood sleep etc. Im moving towards creating a series of products one wearable one stationary lightclockpill dispenser and also an app.So I have some questions!Do you use any appstechnology to maintain routine or track your wellbeing? Sleep medication reminders mood logs Do you use it regularly? Why or why not? What is your daily routine around taking your medication?While manic or depressed how would you react to technology advising you to reach out to family your therapist or you psychiatrist? How would you feel if it alerted them directly? What is the most friendly way you could be reminded to take medication maintain a sleep schedule or reach out for help without feeling chastised?Any other comments and ideas would be much appreciated! Thank you!,Bipolar

45566,Getting bf committed How realistic is this? He's been unmedicated for 2 years and promised a month ago he'd get medicated because I said I won't stay if he doesn't it's been bad.He is currently out of work for going on 8mos and obviously also uninsured. He went to a psych on his sister's bill about 5mos ago was prescribed Abilify did not like the initial side effects so refuses to take it. I can't afford to send him to a new pdoc and a lot of his family is not speaking to him rn because along with losing his job her burned most of his bridges.How realistic is it that we could get him committed and maybe get a new prescription that way? Is this a horrible idea? Will it make him worse? I have not proposed it yet but his counselor did about a month ago. Please help wonderful people of this amazing community. EDIT not wanting to commit him involuntarily. I just want to understand how hospitals or inpatient treatment centers work in situations like this. How does one get medshelp with limited funds is probably more the question. I'm sorry for being such a noob.,Bipolar
46388,A sense of place Hi guys....this is a post I've been thinking of making for a while but I have a hard time wording it. It's one of the big things I struggle with and I think it contributes to my anxiety and depression but I don't know how to express it to others.Here it is I grew up in a rural area and I hated it. When I went away to college at age 18 I moved to a suburb outside of a major city met great new people from all over the world explored the city even though the college is about a 30 min drivesubway ride from it. Basically.....I had fun felt comfortable with the people around me explored new places and felt proud of where I was even though to others it was a bland suburb.Ever since finishing college I have been searching for that feeling again that feeling of just being in the right spot where I need to be. It's been almost 15 years since I left that area. Since then I've lived in 3 different places two suburbs of major cities and downtown in a midsize city.Everywhere I go I long for that feeling of knowing that where I am is a perfect fit....that feeling I only had for the six years Bachelors and Masters at the same college I lived in that suburb at my college.I now live in a suburb of another major city...basically the same distance about 30 min away from the city but with good public transportation so I can go to the city anytime I want...just like the suburb where I went to college. I have met a few great friends here. It is basically the same situation suburb of a large city good friends good public transit to put me in the city when I want to go there.......but I almost hate it here. It doesn't make any sense! My husband is obsessed with buying a house here which is a crazy fantasy bc there's no way we can afford a downpayment anytime soon but that's a whole other issue and I almost get panic attacks thinking about staying here for the rest of my life.And yet every time we move I'm dissatisfied there too. My husband says that if it were up to me we'd just keep moving from place to place for the rest of our lives because whenever we end up somewhere I immediately start talking about moving somewhere else.On paper these places are basically the same as the place where I felt the most comfortable but they don't feel right...in the three places I've lived since leaving that college I've felt like a puzzle piece that just doen't fit.I guess i'm just wondering if anyone else feels this way a sense of never being in the place where you belong....or is this just my own anxiety that's for some reason clinging to this particular issue?I hope this makes sense. I've been trying to explain it to my husband and a number of psychiatrists over the year and they just don't seem to get it.,Bipolar

It's just me and my brain and we're not doing so well right now.But that's not what I wanted to start out with...My head feels heavy. My brain feels like it's clogged and I've been less social lately. I can't concentrate. Too many thoughts are going around and seconds later I forget what I was just trying to remember dammit.

I do theatre so right now Im designing a show trying to do homework trying to balance my meds because the ones Im in now dont fucking work Im in charge of setting up a banquet for our department and EVERYONE keeps talking shit about it. I cant take it anymore. Why do people have to be so mean? Why cant they understand that I have feelings and I have a lot of problems right now?? Why do all these things have to pile up on me now?? Why cant I just be better now?? Sorry for the long rant but I just need to talk to people who kind of get it.

HOWEVER i do sing a lot all through the night. would this be the equivalent? can anxiety override hypomania? i find it pretty hard to figure out my symptoms given that i'm never around other people. it's like my symptoms never reach their full potential because there's no external stimulation. does that make sense? sorry if this has been asked before.,Bipolar

I'm not sure if that's even a quarter of a therapeutic dose. I can't find anything but some anecdotal evidence on the internet including one post here from a year ago.

I'm not bipolar but I am prescribed seroquel which I know is common for bipolar so maybe someone here has some advice or info I am on 150mgday of seroquel. Been on that dose i believe for about 8 months. I was also in a car crash around the same time I started on this dose prior to that I was taking 25mg every few days for sleep. I've noticed since then that I am having awful muscle aches and pains. I noticed it in my back first and got physio thinking it was from the car accident which wasn't a bad accident but I didn't know what else it could be. The physio helped some but I'm noticing other muscles are hurting a lot every day. My right arm will get numbness a fair amount and extreme pain. I'll also have random areas eg. Lower leg that will start hurting for a day then go away. Is this common? Could it be the seroquel? I want to come off it but not sure how fast I can do so. Any help would be very appreciated! ,Bipolar

46460,Am I bipolar? tldr got a diagnosis for bipolar as I was incredibly agitated and restless after a bad reaction to some medication and hospitalized as a manic episode. However I didn't feel elated and I was lucid. Is this bipolar or should I get a second opinion. I'm 31 years old and male.Apologies for the essay.Basically my story starts when I was very depressed and anxious for most of my adult life and medication and therapy didn't do anything to really help. I tried Zoloft one day after the recommendation of my Dr. I woke up in the middle of the night all the time in a panic and couldn't think straight and after a week I was so restless I had to go to hospital. The attending Dr at the hospital said that it is a common reaction to medication if you're bipolar and prescribed me Olanzapine.After 2 months I hated the medication as it made me so sleepy and gain weight. So I decided to stop as I didn't need this before for 31 years. I was also prescribed Klonopin. I stopped Olanzapine and became very restless but I could deal with it with the Klonopin and I took it for 2 weeks. I remember the first day I stopped and I felt amazing though like fully focused and full of positive energy to do things. However one day I forgot to take Klonopin and it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I spent the next month waking up in the middle of the night in panic feeling super restless in the morning and struggling to focus on anything.I came off the Klonopin after that bad experience but slowly tapered I learned my lesson from the Olanzapine not to come of medication too quickly. I also got some Trazadone for sleep since I couldn't sleep for the whole night and would wake up in a panic and also couldn't get back to sleep despite feeling tired. As time went on over the course of 3 months I stopped having the panic attacks in the night but would wake up super early really restless but exhausted. I also started to have depersonalization and had this spaced out feeling a lot of the time and I would sort of feel like I was looked at myself in the third person. This carried on and didn't get better with time over the course of a few months.Around thanksgiving I got really drunk and after then the restlessness became unbearable. I was also super emotional and couldn't focus. But I was fully aware of everything and I didn't do anything reckless and I didn't feel elated or anything. I basically tried to stick it out but couldn't take it and went to hospital and they put me in a psychiatric ward as I was so agitated and restless and it was then they told me they thought I was bipolar and put me on Olanzapine again.I've stuck it out for a few months and to be fair after two weeks of taking Olanzapine and Depakote I started to feel much less restless and I was able to sleep fully. Also the spaced out feeling subsided and started to feel myself again. However the medication has left me super sleepy and it's affecting my work. With my psychiatrist's help we're going to lower the medication dose but after that reduction I'm feeling a bit spaced out but less so than I was before. I'm still super sleepy though.Basically I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and I kind of feel like I've been put in a bipolar box in terms of a diagnosis but when I look at classic bipolar behavior I don't really see it in myself? Has anyone else experienced anything like me? Like severe agitation inability to sleep and depersonalization but also being lucid not engaging in reckless behavior and not having an elated mood?Also that was a massive post so thanks if you read it ,Bipolar

45474,Latuda Dose Increase? I've been taking 20mg of latuda since october 2016 with 1500mg of lithium.. the latuda definitely gave me the moodfunctioning boost i didn't even realize i needed and i feel like i'm back headed towards the rut where my medication could be more on point but nonetheless its working. my pdoc suggested i go from 20mg latuda to 40mg. i'm thinking about agreeing to it and increasing before i have an episode that forces me to switch up my meds.. i just have a few concerns about increasing... i haven't experienced any side effects from latuda. what are some of the things to be aware of that you guys have experienced when you started taking it or when you increased your dose? next do i need to eat even more before i take it? that may be a dumb question but the nausea is excruciating when not eating enough even after 20mg. and last did you guys like have any side effects after increasing? maybe being overtired or a major mood shift? idk i'll stop rambling just looking to hear some peoples thoughtsadviceexperience with increasing their dose.

45902,Not sure what it is... Hi everyone. I'm new here as I've recently been diagnosed I say it like that because its suspected that I have it with Bipolar 2. I was put on Lithium and built up to 900? mg over the course of 9 days i believe 300 for 2 days 600 for another 2 then 900 for 5 days followed by blood work after the 5th day. However after the second day of 900 I started feeling what I believe is hypomania? only to feel completely cluttered and confused after a few hours resulting in me feeling rather scared. A few days later I gradually became more and more agitated hostile and on edge for the most part. Brain zaps knowing what they are as I've experienced them minimally in the past are a constant thing now and are the most severe I've felt them. I go through moments where i feel like crying my eyes out because this whole thing feels so uncomfortable that its practically painful. The urge to cry also hits hard when I'm listening to music which I've been doing A LOT btw. Also with music I feel that its the only thing that calms me down somewhat. Yet it also hypes me up and makes me feel great. But that's somewhat besides the point I guess. I reached out to my doctor about this a few days ago and she wanted me to get off of the Lithium. Its been 2 days now maybe more and I'm not sure if Lithium was even the problem. As a matter of fact I have no clue as to what it could be seeing as I've never felt this way before. Yes I have been euphorically happy and hypomanic as well as severely depressed but I have no clue if its the Bipolar 2 or the Lithium. Anybody have any ideas as to what it could be?,Bipolar

It's sort of eating me alive and it feels like anxiety but I don't even know why I'm anxious and it doesn't go away. It just builds in me and I keep trying to distract myself. It's not as if it's triggered by something specific it's just there constantly in the background. I also have zero appetite and don't feel tired unless I take a lot of sedative supplements but that isn't so abnormal because my eating and sleeping can be all over the place at the best of times. Anyway it just feels bad and I want it to go away and it won't.,Bipolar

45823,Where and What next? Hi. I've had ongoing mental health problems for the past 20 years. For the bulk of it it was assumed to be depression. I went from Effexor to something else and then to Citalopram. Recently...well over the past 8 years really my behavior and moods have deteriorated. It destroyed two jobs and one long term relationship. I had a full psychotic breakdown complete with hallucinations over the weekend. That was my personal breaking point where I was able to finally admit it could be more than depression. I went to the doctor that day rather than wait til monday like I planned. I am now on antipsychotics and am waiting to hear back from a specialist but based on everything he's heard I most definitely have bipolar.My lover is no longer my lover. We had been together for many years. She says she still wants to be friends with me but I do not believe she will be able to do so as I worry she won't ever be able to see past my behaviors while being improperly treated. I did not cheat on her but I was verbally abusive absurdly egotistical and prone to addiction and believing positively bonkers things. Now we're trying to move to separate places. I still love her but I have to let go as I do not think she will ever feel positively towards me due to my actions or the fear that I might relapse while taking this new medication.My questions are as follows Work and Affording an apartment. How the heck do I do it? I'm working as a moving helper in Canada. That isn't exactly steady work here but I hadn't been able to concentrate well enough for better previously. Can I apply for disability or some form of assistance while I adjust to the meds and new diagnosis at least until I'm stable enough to work regularly to earn my rentbill money? Relationships. My family that I had previously abandoned have actually been quite supportive after coming to terms with what I am personally. My wife common law is no longer my wife. I do not think she will ever forgive me for the hurt I caused and I do not believe I may expect her to. How do I move on? Right now I'm trying hard to find answers and to stay busy as I can. I no longer drink been sober for 5 months now smoke or game online gambling on those stupid chance boxes in mobile games more addictive than you might suspect.. ,Bipolar

But then whenever Im not on this high Im so sad and bitter and lonely all the time. I dont wanna talk to anyone or go on social media or get out of my bed. And I just get so introverted and unmotivated to do anything. I also just constantly dwell on everything wrong with myself and my life and I often get suicidal thoughts and so much self hatred. Ive noticed a huge pattern and its getting more and more noticeable. Im 14 female. I do take vyvanse for ADHD which it really affects my mood when I am not on it but even when Im on it now it doesnt make me happy like it used to. Im also taking anti depressants but they havent done fuck all. Im wondering if any of these might be playing a part in it? I dont know. I feel like I dont have anyone. I dont have much friends and the friends I do have arent my ride or die by any means theyre just now friends if you know what I mean. maybe my loneliness is doing this?? Maybe bipolar???

45758,Fibromyalgia AND adhd AND BIPOLAR I Ive dealt with inconsistent mental health care most of my late teens and early 20s. Now that im independent of my mental illnessdenying family i see a good therapist and get consistent treatment.well recently i had a terrible manic episode that put me in a very dangerous situation that i luckily survived. its something i would never do otherwise. after speaking with my therapist she recommended a psychiatrist to me and ive been seeing her. i was tested and boom diagnosed bipolar i and adhd.i was somewhat surprised by the diagnosis but at the same time it explained my entire life.its like fibro is a lot already with three of the many symptoms being anxiety depression and brain fog. i dont want to deal with more. esp. since i really really need to be on a mood stabilizer.its just hard thinking about having to adjust all my medication including possibly my fibro meds. its just a headache to potentially deal with more symptoms side effects while i rework everything.but its really necessary. my manic brain is so sneaky and tricks me so easily. Edit sorry for the poor grammar. my thoughts are racing pretty bad and it makes it hard to type.,Bipolar

45664,Mind and body is broken. If I have to spend one more day at my job I'm afraid I may turn violent. I'm in a really bad place. My meds are out of wack due to switching some stuff..I really hate my office though. Even with a clear head if such a thing exists..I need something new to do but I have no idea what. I'm afraid I'm too broken and under educated to find a new career.I'm 40. My legs and knees are shot. I have loads of impractical experience.I'm deathly afraid I'll kill myself. I'm just as afraid I won't.No one can be this sad and agitated all the fucking time and im so tired of dealing with it alone.Thanks for listening. ,Bipolar
46230,Latuda side effects My doctor increased my Latuda to 80 mg. Since then I've been getting drowsiness spells. I'm not sleepy per se. It feels like I'm paralyzed. I get super anxious. Can't sleep but can't function either. I can't drive. It needs to be taken with food. Ive been trying to take it with dinner but then I'm useless at home. Does anyone else have this side effect or something like it? ,Bipolar
45432,I'm on klonopin but it doesn't seem to be very effective anymore... The background which can be skipped if you'd likeI've been on benzos for about 16 years. At one point when I was 2021 I was put on on Xanax 6mgday which is obscene. I think this increased my tolerance. At the time I was also very depressed maybe exasperated by the Xanax and drinking a liter of vodka a day.Needless to say after a bit of homelessness and finally moving to a different state I was slowly tapered down on Valium. I was relatively stable in that and then was forced to move again to another state where they refused to prescribe any benzos or any adequate medications for my bipolar disorder.I ended up staying in the house for about nine months because I was too anxious to leave. I would go to my psych appointments with no progress on getting them to put me on something that worked for the intense depression I was in. I was seeing a psychiatrist at the time who I really connected with and miss him but have never found another one who I don't feel is judging my life.I quit drinking cold turkey 5 years ago and have never had any more problems with that.However I was then forced to move to yet another state where I couldn't find any psychiatric treatment whatsoever as was unmediated and in a mixed episode for over a year. I did finally get into psychiatric treatment by going inpatient and was put back on klonopin 3mgday which I'm told is a high dose.Then my psychiatrist suddenly died and his clinic closed. Two months later I got an appointment with my wonderful new psychiatrist and was back on track. Unfortunately the klonopin doesn't seem to have much effect on me. I've taken 10mg at once with absolutely no effect I'm aware this is dangerous as fuck but apparently not for me.To the current situationI am looking for a change. My anxiety level is very high but vaping with nicotine I have never been an actual cigarette smoker seems to help quite a bit but not entirely. With the Klonopin not doing its job I feel like a different benzo might be a potential answer. I don't want to be back on Xanax and Valium didn't do much either. Has anyone been in a similar situation with tolerance and successfully switched to a more effective benzo? If so any suggestions?,Bipolar
46354,Distraught over symptoms and diagnosis I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 over summer after being hospitalised for a manic episode where I became acutely psychotic. Since then Ive experience a mixed episodeduring which I displayed psychotic symptoms and have been pretty stable for about two weeks. Last week I became really paranoid for a few days. I feel very suspicious of my parents who I live with and kept thinking they had been altered and werent their original selves. I also had several auditory hallucinations for just one day. This whole this is extremely worrying as I have been violent when psychotic before if I feel my lifes in danger Ill fight and have assaulted staff. I have a great MH team but Im hiding things from them I dont want to tell them about potential psychotic stuff because I cant face it I cant face them suggesting Im Schizoaffective or prone to psychosis or this is going to happen again. I just dont want to even think about it. I dont want this to be happening. Ive worked hard to get into university and want to get my degree and not be sick already been signed off for like two month drs orders. I think if they suggest I might be regularly psychotic or more than BP which Im already struggling with I might end it. I dont want to put people through episodes time and time again the last ones were hellish enough and its not fair. Im drinking to cope but am epileptic and constantly consumed by guilt. My parents are away for two weeks and Ive asked for them to be cut out Im my care updates whilst theyre away so they can enjoy their holiday. I dont know what to do. I dont want this. ,Bipolar
45422,My biggest struggle with BP is probably that I go into full fuck my boss mode sometimes Like when I get depressed I think Oh I can't keep a job I'm pathetic. but it's not that I couldn't keep a job it's that I had shitty bosses in shitty companies and hypomanic me has 0 tolerance for that,Bipolar

45639,I Found What I Was Looking For I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in April 2012. I've struggled with the illness since I was twelveyearsold and initially I was diagnosed with unipolar depression. I've been hospitalized more than ten times. I've been suicidal countless times. Without my medication I experience so many manic breakdownsbreakdowns that are terrifying. I came to terms with my illness in October 2016 after losing someone that I love with all my heart. When this person severed our relationship I realized that I needed my medication to make the paranoia the delusions and the recklessness go away. It was through this loss that I saw the light. But it was as of recently that I realized the way I treated people and myself and my perspective in life was also unacceptable. I have a strong support network but I disclosed everything under the sun to anyone who would listen which is not good for anyone's selfesteem. I was the proverbial empty barrel that made noiseall the contents of my barrel would spill out into the ocean that is life. I was unable to love myself so I sought that love in others. I revealed everything about myself in the hope that someone else could soothe my pain only to scare away people that just wanted a healthy relationship with me. I am sharing my story because medication saved me from the mania but it was mindfulness that saved me from myself. I realized all the love I need is within myself and that I don't need to turn to others to soothe my emotions when meditation coupled with medication can lead one to find the peace and bliss we are all looking for. ,Bipolar
45824,Lost alot of going crazy I lost alot of on the stock market last 2 months. about 260 k worth. I feel like complete shit. I have been sleeping in until noon and staying up until 9 so sleeping 1516 hours at a time. I have no energy. eating one meal. soups and frozen pizzas . ill drag myself out to grocery store tomorrow or next day i guess. havent shaved or showered in days.how do i get out of this i just want it all to end. ,Bipolar
45428,Getting a bit high... escalating quickly So my psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first then added Seroplex SSRI about two weeks ago. And two days ago I finally started getting better. Like a lot lot better. And I feel I'm getting higher and higher as the days pass. Today I'm missing work because all I want to do is to see some friends and climb a building. I wanted to watch a TV show but I can't since I just wanna dance and sing and do something. All my apartment's completely clean much thank's to high me so there's no much to do here.I feel like my chest is heavy as shit my arms and my legs need to move. I've been getting no more than 4 hours of sleep last days. I felt great... Now I feel just awesome.And I just can't get out of my head I should buy anything I think of like this TV which is around 2000 while I have an income of barely half that. It feels right and the right time. Don't know what to do. But guess what I'M GONNA CLIMB A BUILDING. No worry pretty safe though. edit by gt buy,Bipolar
46317,depression makes me feel so crazy and irrational im scared to even talk about it in real life I have spent the majority of the past three years depressed with a few periods of mania and normalcy interspersed here and there. A common pattern I will go into therapy of some kind talk about how I'm depressed I'm sad all the time feel like nothing ever helps me meds never work I want to kill myself and the only thing stopping me is fear it won't work. Get frustrated at all their suggestions walk out feeling worse than I did going in. Then my meds will get adjusted or I'll cycle back up again and feel absolutely fine and quit therapy until the next crisis. Because of this I'm sure my chart is covered with notes about how I'm a difficult patient irrational dramatic draining argumentative and I have have clinicians suggest I have borderline pd or at least traits of it. The thing is when I'm euthymic I'm not like this at all. I may be a little more sensitive than the average person but other than that I'm perfectly normal. Anyway my point is that I always get embarrassed by how melodramatic I get during depressive episodes and because of this I am scared to go back to therapy and repeat this pattern. I already have a lot of difficulty opening up to people and have always found therapy insanely difficult and this just makes it worse. I also know at this point I'm being irrational and I don't need anyone to point it out to me but I also don't know what to do when I feel like this that doesn't involve professional help. I'm not sure why I'm posting this just hoping to hear any advice anyone has or if anyone else feels the same way? I literally feel like depression turns me into a completely different person and I hate it.,Bipolar

46268,Abilify Withdrawal? I'm thinking of dropping my abilify 15mg to see if my lamictal is enough to hold my moods on its own. At the current dose lamictal has worked wonders for my depressionanxiety and if it's able to control my hypomania then that would be amazing so I feel like this is something worth trying to keep my meds as few as possible.

46289,Just about to start work and I feel terrible After months of job hunting I finally got the job that I want through connections. In the past year I've gotten accepted in certain jobs but I quit the moment I felt like the job wasn't what was stipulated in the contract. This new job I got is legal and legit. This is the job that i really really want.But throughout the process of passing job requirements my enthusiasm just dwindled and panic or maybe dread is a better term to express what I feel. I don't know how I will handle this job after just being able to handle my bipolar moods. I feel jittery and i don't feel that I deserve this. I play around with thoughts of overdosing to feel more balanced but of course that's stupid and counterproductive.I didn't know where to post this and even opening up to my family and SO I feel like they can't really understand what I mean when I say these things.I just want to make this job last and I just want to have the courage to stick with it even if challenges or events overwhelm me.,Bipolar
45825,Bad decisions. 32 M. BP1. I am in this viscous cycle of being depressed and wanting to alleviate those feelings. The easiest way is through deviant sexual stuff. Im happily married with a great family but its like I have to escape from the current situation of feeling horrible. Chatting w people online or attempting to chat w people is about the only thing that feels good. Then when Im manic I cant get enough and start doing the same stuff online. Then I feel super shitty about it a couple dayshours later and delete everything and stay away from it for a while. Only to be brought right back to the same place. Anyone else suffer from this sick circle?,Bipolar
45691,Happiness or Anxiety or Hypomania? Hey fellow bipolar people! I have a question...how can you tell if youre just in a really good mood or if you are going into hypomania? The two times I was manic I was having lots and lots of irritability and insomnia and a ton of anxiety. My doctor suggested those were manic episodes based on what I could remember. Now whenever Im feeling particularly good Im constantly worried that Im not actually happy but instead hypomanic. For example I had a good day at work. I got a project done and I got to socialize with my favorite people. Usually work can be a somewhat dramatic place but those people were out today. Im home now and Im feeling good as in not tired or socially exhausted which is funny because Im typically an introvert but mostly around people I dont know. I also have a tremor....which is usually a sign of anxiety or that Im really hungry. Big anxiety attacks have resulting in my legs shaking uncontrollably. Can happiness cause anxiety? I dont feel anxious that often around other people. Maybe I just have low blood sugar? Im on Lamotrigine and Effexor and I take Hydroxyzine at night to sleep if that makes a difference at all. Ive been sleeping throughout the night this week which I think is a good sign.Any thoughts? Im going to ask my therapist too next week. ,Bipolar
45907,Some Questions From a Newly Diagnosed Bipolar Person Hey I am 18 and male and diagnosed bipolar. Currently the only things I am taking for my bipolar disorder are NAC and fish oil. I am also diagnosed adhd so if some of this is irrelevant to Bipolar disorder I apologize in advance.Onwards with the questionsMy psychiatrist has tried to prescribe my mood stabilizers most recently lamotrigine and I have refused to take them. I really enjoy the high feelings I get and don't want to give them up. I also am deathly scared of putting any drugs into my body. I do not even drink. Has anyone tried this drug? What has your experience with mood stabilizers been?Some months I legitimately cannot focus. Like even reading for me is just not going to happen. I meditate every day and during some months getting my self to sit still is a near impossibility. I am a master level chess player but I have to play multiple games at once to properly stimulate myself. I have found that intense exercise especially weights and competition help a bit. I have also used audiobooks. Does any have any other coping strategies when they cannot focus?I am hypersexual. Like it is all I think about. If I wasn't so busy with sports academics and music I would probably sleep with a different girl at least every week. I don't even really enjoy it I just sleep with a girl within 30 mins of meeting her at a party or on a first date and then I feel like shit the next few days. Then I think I really like her for a sec. Then next week I decided I am bored with her and it's on to the next girl. The only girl I didn't get bored of was this other girl I slept with who had bipolar disorder too. She was just crazy enough to keep things interesting. She got a boyfriend though.I really want a stable relationship but my habits seem to prevent that. On top of that I have a horrible reputation because of the number of girls I have slept with and the way I have slept with them and used them mostly for sex although I have always had consent and never slept with even a tipsy girl.How do you guys hold down a stable relationship? It seems hopeless with hypersexuality boredom and mood instability. Speaking of which 4. How do you deal with loneliness? I have many friends but I still get lonely. I use sex to cope but that is clearly insufficient. A relationship would be ideal and I am working on it but is there anything else I can do? 5. How have you reconciled giving up these manic episodes when they are so appealing not just because of the emotions but also because you are better at everything confident and able to have life experiences you would never otherwise have. 6. How do you explain to your friends when they ask if you are on drugs right now or comment that it is like you are either marijuana your name or meth your name depending on the week. I don't want to tell them I am bipolar and I didn't even know for sure until recently.,Bipolar
45841,Having weird fever dreamsnightmares despite taking meds properly Im taking my lamictal rexulti Doxepin and vistaril every night and morning as directed. For months I had normal dreams and normal nightmares but for the past week Ive had fever dreams that are so intense I wake up feeling the emotions I felt in the dream. Im wondering if it has anything to do with the medications I take and I wont see my doctor for another 3 months. Ive been incredibly manic for the past few months and now Im dipping into a depressive episode maybe that has something to do with it. ,Bipolar
46081,When is it ok to tell someone about a psych ward visit if at all? Whenever I meet someone new I always wonder when its appropriate if at all to tell them what Im going through. Only because it is such a big life event and applies to my current position. Example Ive been out of work now for 3 months this was after a psych ward visit for 2 weeks and just help my family out and take time for myself time to get back to work but still nervous to. So Im talking to this guy whenever he asks me what Im up to or do I have any plans for the day or the next day you get what I mean I only have so many things to say you know. Finally I just responded yesterday with yep not really much planned and ugh I kinda just want to tell him about the psych visitso he can see where Im coming from and not like I just never have anything to do. Thoughts? Anyone else with similar experience? When is it appropriate if at all to explain this to someone. Im passed the idea that they will think Im crazy or different or judge me I guess but still worried about it. ,Bipolar
45408,Feel alienated and alone on NYE Every winter I get into a deep depression. It makes me focus on how I have no meaningful relationships and especially no significant other. Ive developed a resentment for couples. Its just jealousy but it becomes intrusive thoughts. Ill always be alone youll never find someone for you. Its sick thinking but I dont know how to make it stop.I want to be able to be happy without needing things outside myself. It feels pathological because on certain meds the obsession goes away unfortunately along with my sex drive. I would usually talk shit about people who need to be in a relationship really badly to feel okay. But goddamn I just want to cuddle and be next to someone. I hope this year is different and better than last year. Good luck guys. ,Bipolar
45688,My date told me I can't pursue this because I am not capable of handling mood disorder. So sorry. This was several days after a very nice meal was shared and it came up that one of her past boyfriends has bipolar and iswas an addict to a couple of things. I am not an addict and I felt that she unfairly lumped me in with him. It's no great loss as this was only the first date and I suppose I should be glad that it ended as swiftly as it did.

46021,Now What?? Looking back I can see this shift started when my best friend was diagnosed with brain cancer. Palliative. I work at his family physicians office. Managing the practice.I seemed to hang in there somewhat until about 3 weeks after he passed. I didn't see it coming. I didn't attribute what was happening to what I had experienced with him. And I didn't talk to anyone about what I felt at any point.Now I'm home trying to put the peices of my life together. Trying to keep what I still have in one peice simultaneously.It's not really going well.My thoughts are too scattered to follow. My feelings are overwhelming and fleeting.I'm sick of being sick. But it turns out working to avoid it doesn't help anymore than any other thing I've read about or attempted.Meds lol. Which ones??I managed to become more successful without them than I have managed to maintain with them.At what point do life experiences and there impact get added into the equation of medacting someone. That is not a question. Because psychiatry and psychology are two separate parts of a faulty medical system. Until they become one psychiatry is winging it. Treating train wreck trauma and cat scratches with fentanyl all the same. ,Bipolar
46029,I don't get this thing happening right now. Ok. There's a celebrity that I think is very hot and I'd love to go out on a date with him. So in my head I wrote an email to approach him fantasized on him coming to my house to pick me up what I would say during the date. And this is now stuck in my head. After 3 or 4 days of thinkingfeelinghaving this fantasy I've accepted that this is sooo impossible it's not funny. But why am I getting obsessive? i would check the mail every few hours in a day hoping he'd answer. I would cry a little bit knowing that he would reply that I'm not good enough in his circles too crazy.Logic says I want the impossible. My brain keeps going over this. I'm looking at all his pics on the net. I want to know what he smells like. This is all irrational. And it's not going away. WTF?,Bipolar

45987,Um is it me? So I finally got an appointment with a real psychiatrist two weeks ago and was diagnosed with bipolar II. However at the time I couldn't believe how the office was set up. You walked into a waiting room with two receptionist windows on the other side. The receptionists sat behind frosted glass windows that were closed and in front of each was one of those bells. There were no signs specifying which window to go to or even saying please ring bell for service. I must have stood there fidgeting for 3 or 4 minutes before finally knocking on the window lightly no way was I gonna ring a bell in a quiet office. Then while I was filling out my paperwork they decided to turn on music and it was the Braveheart soundtrack. So I'm sitting there listening to the sountrack to a film where someone gets disembowled and it occurs to me that they can't be THAT stupid and they must have hidden cameras or something to see what their patients do in such an uncomfortable situation. Now two weeks later I'm like um you totally thought someone was watching you on a hidden camera. So since I've never dealt with psychiatry before was that being delusional or is that honestly something plausible?,Bipolar
45873,Does Depakote give you anxiety? I started Depakote about two weeks ago. Zero side effects felt like taking nothing no drowsiness or anything. But the last two or three days have been the worst anxiety and panic attacks Ive had in years. Ones that last hours and involve extreme dissociation dysphoria. At 23 I can honestly say I havent had my panic attacks and OCD flare up this bad since childhood when I had no coping mechanisms . I almost checked myself into the damn hospital just because I wanted someone ELSE to deal with my crazy ass lol wishing to be sedated so the terror and intrusive thoughts and obsessions would go away and give me some peace. Lasted at least five hours. None of my usual mind tricks coping tricks were working just kept getting stuck in that OCDanxiety panic loop unable to break free or calm down. Scared for literally no reason and then scared wondering if that means Im going crazy because fear of insanity is one of my OCD obsessions.My sister finally talked me down over the phone but this is H E L L. Its like being a scared kid who doesnt know what to do about this feeling but all over again and Im an adult. Im wondering if anyone thinks it could be the Depakote? My anxiety and OCD were at high functioning levels for years until two weeks of Depakote. Cant see the doctor until the 23rd because hes on vacation so Im asking yall untilI can ask him.,Bipolar
45999,Does anyone else have the urge to stop taking their meds? I struggle with the urge to stop taking my meds all the time. I'm tired of the weight gain and the side effects. The antipsychotics seem to have the worst side effects. But I know if I stop taking them I'll turn into a crazy bitch. Yet even on medication I still also struggle with impulsive sex with strangers. Does anyone also still experience impulsive actions even on medication? This is something that makes me feel quite ashamed and is not healthy. ,Bipolar
45409,Question for older people does it really get better? So I'm almost 13 years in on this. I was diagnosed when I was 24 so I've been consciously dealing with it for a big chunk of my adult life and honestly while my episodes aren't as outwardly extreme it doesn't feel like I am getting better I'm just controlled and left with an uncomfortable anxiety and paranoia in place of the bigger feelings.And some of the more peripheral symptoms are definitely more pronounced and progressive. Every year it seems like I have more trouble with memory attention and verbal ability. I have ways to work around all of this but it's exhausting to keep myself on and not get lost in thought. My so sometimes doesn't understand me or has to remind me to answer someone if they've asked me a question and I'm just staring into space.It feels like I have a very slow drawn out terminal illness.How does this progress?

December was a very difficult month for me and this subreddit became a sanctuary during some especially hard moments. So first of all thank you to all of you.

But then responses of love and encouragement began pouring in. It was empowering and brought me a sense of hope I haven't had in a while.People from all parts of my life began private messaging me sharing their own stories of mental health challenges.I realized that talking openly about my challenges is very helpful to me in the start of the journey to management.

45708,Does lithium on its own relieve depression? Or is what I'm feeling the calm before the storm? I'm pretty scared I've been taking 900mg of lithium er daily since I was in the psych ward for a month April 2017. Pretty soon after I was discharged I was prescribed lithium but not er. I had diarrhea every day it felt like my body was rejecting it. I was still sorely depressed. Then in September I got to start extended release lithium. I gradually felt better I got a job I felt more like myself. Then this last week I feel like I went through a period of hypomania. Probably relatively mild hypomania. I couldn't sleep without taking Seroquel my head felt on edge it sucked. Nothing about it was enjoyable.Right now it seems to have stopped I feel something akin to normal. But I'm scared. Is this the calm before the storm? Is the lithium helping me? Or am I going to spiral back down into hell?,Bipolar
45503,Insights from over two years of custom mood tracking SO MUCH DATA Some background statistics are needed to understand these interpretations and I'll do the most basic explanation I can to make it most accessible while risking misrepresenting it if you want to get pedantic and explain it better in the comments go ahead. The explanations are in the footnotes below. my mood over the past two years has improved slightly but overall stayed about the same. an average mood of 64.76 for 2016 and 64.91 for 2017 that's something. 576 days out of 741 77 of days felt more good than bad. I spent 92 days in the last two years with a mood lower than 40 12 of the 741 days I spent 15 days severely depressed 2 I spent 8 days with strong suicidal feelings and 3 days actively pursuing suicide I spent 159 days with a mood above 80. 57 were in 2017 99 were in 2016 and the remainder were in either 2015 or 2018 for which few days have been recorded. I spent 24 days euphoric mood 90 I spent 8 days on top of the world euphoric moodgt92 my mood had a standard deviation of 18.86 percentage points for 2016 and 15.60 percentage points for 2017 I've gotten more stable. A full time job does that I guess. So does no longer having the tribulations of terminal cancer in your life. my happiest days of the last two years were all in 2016 lower standard deviation suggested as much an emphatic thank you to the redditor behind 81416 being one of them my custom manic rating scale suggests I spent 34 days in 2017 some kind of manic 9.3 and 51 days in 2016 some kind of manic 14 Getting off lowers my stress levels and increases my mood each orgasm reduces my perceived stress by 3 percentage points. with a p value of under .001. With mean stress levels of 35.7 that's about an 8.4 difference per orgasm. Each orgasm also raises my mood by about 3 percentage points for a typical increase of 4.7 per orgasm. each 1 out of 10 point increase in my stress levels increases my anxiety on average by 4 percentage points. With mean anxiety levels of 28 that's a 14 difference per point. the effects of alcohol on my mood are unclear. My mood tracker strongly suggests Plt.001 I drink more when I feel good but the direction of causality here is likely such that I drink because I feel good rather than because it makes me feel good. The data isn't of a nature that can tell me how it affects me during the duration of alcohol. It's clear there isn't sufficient evidence to strongly support the hypothesis that alcohol makes me in particular depressed. sleep plays a highly significant role in minimizing stress and anxiety with p values of .01 and .03 respectively and meaningful correlation coefficients. weed improves my mood by .624 percentage points per level of rtrees highness scale. with a p value of .019 and a mean mood of 64.84 that's about a 1 improvement per point of highness. At a total high that's a 10 increase in mood and a very high likelihood of experiencing some psychosis. At a moderate high that might be a 5 increase in mood. In other words weed definitely improves my mood overall but at level other factors are still very important. It's worth noting that the percentage increase in mood is different based on the baseline mood if I'm at a suicidal depression typical such mood around 15 1 is most suicidal ever on my scale a 10 point increase in mood is actually an increase in mood of 67. I actually used weed the last time I was suicidal to get out of those feelings and it helped me. Weed is risky and makes some of us psychotic and can make us depressed. Use it with caution if at all. weed increases my sleep. with an average night's sleep lasting 7.96 hours and an increase of .045 hours per point of the rtrees highness scale for a very strong high increasing my hours slept by a half hour this is probably weaker than it should be because of an alarm weed impairs my cognition. p value lt.002 weed causes me psychosis with a p value of less than .001. Typically the psychosis hasn't been severe so it's something I've continued. It's not helping me but that's why they call it a vice. I drank a bit more in 2017 than 2016 thanks to a bender around July where I learned to cope with boredom better 1.24 drinks per day vs 1.1 drinks per day but I've had two drinks in 2018 for an average of .18 drinks per day. I intend to drink again but I'm giving my liver a break for the time being.P value is most basically explained as the likelihood of occurring due to chance with 1 meaning 100 and 0 meaning couldn't randomly occur at all I know this isn't quite right but this is a simplification. R squared is how well an algorithm explains the data. a high r squared means a regression has high explanatory power. 1 is a perfect fit 0 is no fit. Beta is the strength of a correlation. If my mood is measured on a 100 point scale and one unit of sleep changes my mood by 6 points then sleep would have a beta of 6. Standard deviation is a descriptor for the amount of variation in a data set. If everything is close to average it's got a low standard deviation. If everything is very disparate it will have a high SD.Edit thought I had percent and percentage point confused somewhere but was wrong so I fixed it twice oops.Edit 2 I wanted to share it but was feeling too worn out to set up a new one for you guys but uglitterbeast reminded me I posted about it before and had a dropbox saved file for ithttpswww.reddit.comrBipolarRedditcomments6mmchnmakingamoodtrackerhowididitwhyyoumight. I updated the one I linked in the description there to make it more likely to output possible mania as it seemed to fail at this corrected an error that was getting in the way of accurate alcoholrelated depression results and changed the dates to be for 2018Edit 3 the biggest thing I might change for yourself if I was you would be the role of your sex drive in your manic rating. Most people don't keep the same baseline libido as I do and plenty of people don't have their libido as a very strong indicator of mania.,Bipolar
45433,What do you think? TW suicide self injury httpsnakedsecurity.sophos.com20180104artificialintelligencetolistenforsuicidalthoughtsonsocialmediaApparently it's being tested in Canada for artificial intelligence to catch behavior related to selfharm and suicide on social media. As a community in which these behaviors are discussed frequently I'm wondering what you all think of this.Part of me thinks it's a good idea. If we can prevent these behaviors isn't that a good thing? However part of me is taken aback. Would I be willing to discuss my suicidal thoughts or talk about self injury online if I knew that information might be used to single me out?

I'm coming out of a manic episode. Before and during the episode I had no problem getting up early because I didn't worry about what to do with my time and any extra time. Now I have overwhelming dread over time as if I had something very specific and difficult to worry about but its just simply the passage of time. It feels like I'm in jail although I don't know what that is actually like. Can anyone else relate to this?,Bipolar

I feel like I did when I was at my worst I've been on 100 mg lamictal and recently upped it to 150 eventually supposed to get to 200. I don't know for sure that what I'm feeling is because of the meds. I don't think lamictal is strong enough to get a reaction like this the impression I got is that it's mild or something but I also don't know anything about how meds actually work. It's like I have an electric current going through me I can't close my eyes and I can't sleep. I'm starting to get irritated like I did before and crying a lot and getting that bone deep sorrow for no real reason. Everything's turned up to eleven and I really do feel like I'm crazy like the way it felt before I got diagnosed. I'm scared because I'm feeling that zero inhibitions I can do anything kind of mood and this is when I feel most like I could go through with it,Bipolar

He recalled that when he was a child of 10 he had a pet rat whom he very much loved. A few days ago some extra money came our way and we decided to acquire two rats as pets for him and secondarily for me. Bust my buttons! He has been engaged taskoriented energized calmall since the rat adoption. Today we got a third becausewell how could we resist. He has been playing with the rats feeding them tending to them and just letting them ride in the hood of his sweatshirt.

I've been cancelling my therapy appointments because I have too much anxiety to talk about my problems but then as a drawback I don't get to talk about my problems. Now I actively want to die instead of just passively. Last night I stood outside in the cold until my fingers hurt so much I cried that wasn't the goal the goal was fresh air but that's what ended up happening.I'm thinking the most likely outcome is that getting out of the house for longer than 30 minutes for the first time in two weeks will improve my mood enough that I'll find some other reason to live past that. But right now all I've got figured out is I'm going to see the movie before I do any dangerous impulsive thing. Sound good?,Bipolar

45888,X posted manic safety plan with SO So. I'm a constant suicidal thoughts person. They're always there but I'm always too exhausted to do anything and love the people in my life way too much. EXCEPT for when I'm manic. Manic lows or highs give me so much energy and that tends to worry myself and my boyfriend. The only time I really consider hurting myself is when I am manic. Often needing my boyfriend to stop me.I'm going to Europe in June and want to work with my boyfriend to create a safety plan for when I'm feeling like this. One of those when I'm feeling like this I'll do this. If that doesn't work I'll do this. This isn't just for suicidal ideations but also other side effects to the mania.A big part of the reason I want to do this with my boyfriend is that he is far more concerned than I am that I'll do something I would regret doing or hurt myself. Biggest two concerns are me cheating on him or me hurting myself. Mostly this is to put his mind at ease when I'm away. He worries about me so much when I am here never mind my two months away from him.What are some good steps to have on the plan? And circumstances to account for? Also any good apps to put this plan into your phone? I want this to be in my phone and accessible when I am out.,Bipolar

The idea is that on Sundays you post a list of tasks or habits you want to work on during the week then the following Saturday we review how we got on.

45426,I feel like a failure because I've had to move home to deal with my mental illness I've been just fine living abroad for over a year but I came home for the holidays with the intent to move on to another country afterwards. But in the last week or so before I came home my mental health dropped off a cliff. And it has continued to fall. And now I'm having to change my entire life plan because I need to take care of this so badly that I need to stick around my hometown while I seek therapy. This is such a sudden change from everything that I'd had planned for MONTHS and now I feel like a failure because I have to move back and stick around to deal with my stupid mental illness. Like as it is I'm depressed as hell and feeling this sense of failure on top of that is only making it worse. I have an intake appointment with a local counseling center next week so I am actively working on getting help but everything still sucks. Now I have to find a car a job and an apartment I can't handle living with my parents for longer than a couple of weeks which are factors that I hadn't planned for at all. I have a lovehate relationship with my hometown I've fantasized about getting the fuck out of here ever since I was like 14 years old and it breaks my heart that when I finally made a huge move that I'd been wanting to make for years living abroad I now have to cut that plan short to deal with this mental illness shit. Which is why it feels like failure I tried something that I'd been wanting for SO long and just when I thought that I'd made it I ended up stuck back here to deal with factors beyond my control.So the point of this is part vent but part has anyone ever felt like this? and if the answer to that is yes any tips on what to do about it?,Bipolar

I been bit down lately since I lost my pet unexpectedly over the Christmas break I was riding the hyper train for a week and a half then until the day my pet died unexpectedly my mood drop and after the new years I forgot my meds a few times thus rare thing I do was my idiot fault I know...I wasn't sleeping well earlier in the week at 3 am in the dark I thought I saw a shadow person in the distance but it could of been just my imagination of being tired. The last time I saw shadowy people I wasn't sleeping well and sort of in the dumps since Christmas I have been on my period for 3 weeks due to the neximplanon I been on it only for 4 month still my body getting used to it.

Going to a doctor get that tested soon.Its been a few days since then so it hasn't happened since maybe I am paranoid but that's rare.

It's getting really hard to keep going when all I'm ever met with is disappointment.I'm caught in this stranglehold the manic side of me sees all this potential and what I can be if I put my mind to it but I always fall short and that just further verifies what the depressed side of me feelsthat I'm not worth much of anything and I have no real way of making my life better.It leaves me with no motivation to even try to do better because it's always ended the same way.I feel like I'm running out of time to get my life in order and I don't even really have a clue what to do with my life.I've been trying to just take the bad with the good but I just keep wondering when the good is going to come and it just makes me so damn disappointed with myself.Nobody has to reply or anything I think I just wanted to write all this down somewhere to try and get me to stop ruminating over my life,Bipolar
45535,My Current Battle with Employment Discrimination This is a long story so I'll try to keep it as brief as I can and only include pertinent details. For those that just want a brief summaryTLDR the Peace Corps rejected me because I admitted to having bipolar not thinking anything of it because I am high functioning and my doctor can clear me. I decided to fight this to the bitter end since I am not my mental illness and they can't reject me based on their discriminatory and outright archaic assumptions about the conditionI am a 23 year old college student that will graduate this spring with degrees in Biology and French. Three years back I was diagnosed BP II and as most of you know it was a wild ride. By communicating with my psychiatrist and by making the right lifestyle choices I have remained totally asymptomatic for more than a year.Being young and hoping to join Doctor's Without Borders someday I decided I would join the Peace Corps to gain the necessary public health program experience and to expand my French I'm looking at West Africa. I spent a large amount of time working on my resume and statement and kept in touch with my local Peace Corps recruiter. He gave me advice and assured me that I was a shoein for a position in Benin because of my health care experience and language experience I work as a fulltime Rec Therapist while finishing classes full time. Not easy but incorporating the right lifestyle choices has helped my time management.After I turned in my application I was informed that I would have to fill out a Health History form divulging any medical conditions that I had. Naturally I was honest my doctor said he'd provide a letter clearing me medically and my recruiter already said verbatim that I am extremely qualifiedWhat happened next blew me away. An automated email was sent to me after I turned in the Health History form informing me that my condition could not be supported in the country I chose. Not one person from the organization would speak to me further about the issue. I've been told dozens of times about how they're sorry but they simply don't make those decisions. What's really shocked me is that my resume and essay we're not even looked at because of admitting the condition.I have been hiding my mental health ever since my diagnosis. It has not affected my professional life or my work. I am high functioning and need no more accommodation than a healthy volunteer whatever that is. Having them reject me for checking the wrong box made me incredibly angry and hurt. But instead of accepting this I've been fighting it for the past 2 months. I've called senators lawyers mental health advocacy groups and have begun the informal resolution process with their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. When they asked what I hoped to get out of this process I told them that I want to be medically cleared and that I want them to put an end to this discriminatory process. Odds are they will not give me an inch so I am prepared to take this to District Court there was a case in 1996 where a volunteer was rejected because she admitted to taking antidepressants. The court ruled in her favor and this decision gives me hope.The most exciting development will come the end of this month. Patrick J. Kennedy nephew of John F. Kennedy who coincidentally founded the Peace Corps will be coming to my city to advocate for mental health rights. Patrick Kennedy was diagnosed with bipolar himself so I'm doing everything in my power to go to the conference and talk to him get him a letter anything if there's an offhand chance to get him to lobby the PC on my behalf I need to take it.I'm not giving up this fight until I receive my letter of acceptance or until they tell me stop calling us or we will contact the police. I will let you guys know the newest updates as they come up if you have any ideas for me on how to fight this archaic government process please throw your ideas here.As always never give up trying new things to get your condition under control. It is possible and things will get better if you try.,Bipolar

45739,Content Warning Florida and Media Representation of Mental Illness Reading of the news of another mass casualty in the US yesterday was first heartbreaking then infuriating. Every news outlet I saw pointed toward the focus on mental illness. POTUS went as far as saying that he wanted to tackle the complex problem of mental illness. WTF does that mean?Is he referring to ensuring that healthcare is readily available to Americans living with mental illnesses? Or that those who have mental illnesses will be receiving assistance in obtaining treatment?Why is it that the only time people speak to mental health as an issue as a priority is when a lot of people are dead? Why is the culpability always on mental illness and never on a negligent gun legislation? Here in Canada we have a make shift day of awareness that has its own set of problems because it is funded by a corporation that doesn't respect the mental health of its own employees. We're trying but we do have basic mental health coverage and care that isn't always afforded elsewhere. Folks outside of North America is this the same portrayal? ,Bipolar

45917,7 years later tales from an SO Hey all. A whiiiiiiile back I had a really rough week. And I wrote about it here.httpsnp.reddit.comrBipolarRedditcommentsfy8mxitsalongstorybutineedtotellitWell I just wanted to sayLIFE IS FUCKING GRAND.Yeah Chris has bipolar. Yeah his medications suck. But he's up again. He's doing again. This isn't a sudden thing either this has been slow and gradual and we wouldn't want it any other way as if we had it faster that's... bad news.But... our relationship is better than it's ever been. I stuck through the worst of things and honestly the worst was only about 12 years. Only. I know that's a long time but seriously compared to eternity it's nothing. During that 12 years time I basically had lost all hope and was only driven by my promise and loyalty to my husband. Promises that were hard to keep because he seemed like such a doppelganger.We kept adjusting medications. We lowered stress in our lives. I took over on all the hard stuff and I give Chris whatever latitude I can. I've lost my judgementality. Chis still judges himself very strongly and I am trying to help him be less critical. He's come a long way but he wants to help more and I think this is a good sign. He just needs to be more patient with himself.About 4 years ago he had another psychotic break. This was while he was medicated. But the problem was we were moving. The stress of this put him over it's something that happens. But the second time was much milder much easier. Firstly everything was set up so we had a pdoc The best thank you Madeline god thank you so god damned much and he had medication and he was able to recognize the discrepancies. The first time through he had no idea something had gone wrong in his head. But this time he DID and it made a HUGE difference. Here's where I wrote about ithttpwww.pushypixels.compost122389851999missingthemanwhoisthere at one point sorry the picture is missing my hosting screwed up I'll have to fix that later.Anyway that was much milder and cleared up in a few months.So all sounds pretty badish not GRAND like I claim but seriously let's step back and look at things specifically this statementgt During that 12 years time I basically had lost all hopeI. Had. Lost. All. Hope.I had lost the LOVE OF MY LIFE. He was gone. I was resigned to caring for his shell for the rest of my days. I even... god help me... I even wished for his death.

45968,Struggling with new medication and shame. I was diagnosed with bipolar ii three years ago. This is the first time I've been on mood stabilizers. I had a lot of shame when I was diagnosed and they started me on antidepressants. After awhile I stopped taking them. Stopped going to my CBT appointments. Essentially went MIA because I felt like everyone around me was treating me like I was crazy.My highs and lows have been out of control lately. After struggling with self harm when I was depressed and nearly quitting my job and deciding to move to another state I didn't. I decided I needed some help.So now I'm on 300mg of seroquel. I just started it so I need to give it some time but every fiber of my being says 'flush them.' I feel like I zombie and I'm wondering if maybe I can just learn to cope instead of being on medication. I smoke weed sometimes to help curb my anxiety and help me sleep. Sleep isn't an issue now. I know there is a good chance I'll gain weight and I'm already pretty overweight so that idea alone makes me feel really shitty. I'm ashamed to be on medication again so nobody in my family knows. Just this thread and one friend now...I feel alone in all of this so I suppose that's why I'm writing here. Thoughts? Suggestions?edit added a sentence and spelling correction,Bipolar
45555,Anyone ever experienced this on Latuda? I've been taking Latuda for about two weeks now first week at 40 then upped to 60. 40 seemed okay but 60 made me throw up the meds so my psych changed me to 20mg in the morning and 40 mg in the evening. I feel absolutely horrible. After taking the meds I feel this excrutiating restlessness like a constant surge of electricity running through my brain. Nothing helps. I can't focus on anything. It's so bad that when I feel it coming on I take antihistamines to slow my brain down and sleep it off. It's left me writing on my bed before trying to get it to go away.Obviously I'm not taking this again until my doc can prescribe me something new. Is this normal for Latuda? ,Bipolar
45961,300mg Lithium enough for BPII maintenance? My doctor started me on 300mg day in 2015 and in 2016 increased to 600mg at my request. It was my first time getting treatment for BP specifically and it helped me get to the stable place I am at now. However I am suffering side effects related to lithium weight gain acne diarrhea memoryfocus issues dry skin drowsinessslugishness and want to reduce my dose back to 300mg. I am now taking 400mg lamotrigine so I feel like that should be stable.However I can't find much research on levels that low. I'm meeting with my doctor next week but in the meantime just reduced it and feeling more alive. I asked my partner and a friend to let me know if it seems like I am starting to get hypomanic. I hope that this can be stable because it feels nice to lose the bogged down feeling. I want to be vigilant about distinguishing the feeling of a good mood from hypomania. Does anyone have experience with low dose lithium and or cultivating selfawareness about good stable moods vs hypomania?,Bipolar
45646,Anybody else unable to focus on thingsbored while depressed? I'm really frustrated with myself. I used to be able to focus on a book or a video game or a TV show for hours on end. I used to be able to finish long books in one sitting. But then my mood cycled right back into depression and I can barely do anything or focus on anything. If I'm watching TV I have to bounce from one thing to another on my phone can't focus on the TV show. If I read a book I can't even finish the chapter even if they are short. If I play a video game maybe I'm lucky and I play for an hour but mostly it's less than 15 minutes and I'm done.I was feeling so good a few weeks ago and I was able to pay attention to things but then my mood shifted again. Sometimes I wish for hypomania so I can get things done. Anybody else experience this? What helps you?,Bipolar
45524,For the ladies out there Bipolar and that time of the month? some stats i'm 23 diagnosed with BP 1 with psychotic features Major depressive disorder severe panic disorder PTSD amp mild ADD when i was 21 but have been dealing with BP symptoms since i was around 14 or 15. i'm also extremely sensitive to almost everything. So i notice when its that time of the month or whatever i've pretty much always noticed this My moods get a bit dangerous. i'll be mostly stable the rest of the month but since i'm already a sensitive person when i'm on my period i feel like my moods go to the extremes really quick. right now i keep having random extremely angry thoughts. i don't have anything to be mad about. but i just feel almost uncontrollably angry. its like literally my brain goes to polar opposites and its frustrating. I've been dealing with extreme moods while on my period for a really long time. i'm just not sure if its me or if Bipolar has an effect? Does anyone know if BP amps up the mood swings or am i just a moody bitch? lol. I currently am not on any medication due to some insurance problems. but i do smoke weed regularly indica only and it helps a LOT. more than the pills in my opinion but i know i need meds just need to figure out this whole insurance thing.In the past i've been on MANY medications amp honestly none of them helped while it was that time of the month. Some of them made me worse more depressedtriggered Mania. I've been told Birth Control helps but i don't notice a difference. I asked my doctor and she says its very possible but i just want to know from people who have BP.Sorry if this is an inappropriate question I'm just curious really. Side note being an adult is an inconvenience can i make a new character and start over? lol. Also i notice i ramble a lot. my thoughts are always like this amp they never really make sense. its even worse when i talk irl amp i'm actually probably the most awkward thing on this planet. It's gotten a bit worse over the years amp i think my brain kinda has lagged out on me. idk. Sorry about that. anyways hope everyone has a wonderful day!!!,Bipolar
46444,I think the best thing Ive realized is that I may not be able to walk my entire life I dont know where to share this so I thought Id share it here since its such a great community and its good to think about things youre grateful for.Im thankful Im able bodied. Im thankful for my medication. I may have 20 more years before I could possibly get MS. I might never get it but Im more likely than the average person.But Im still able bodied now. I can enjoy walking places. I can enjoy climbing and going up stairs upon stairs. I can enjoy the sand and water on my feet. I can enjoy having to stand all day.I might not be able to for my entire life but knowing that allows me to enjoy my legs my brain and my life right now. A lot of people dont get that until they suddenly dont have a limb or theyre old and their body becomes increasingly more frail.Enjoy the moment. Enjoy the little things. Even the fact youre under a ton of blankets cold or have to wait for your car to heat up.I hope we all have a lot more time to enjoy what we have. Sometimes weI take the time weI have for granted. 20 years sounds like a lot but thats only double my age.I hope you all are having a good day. Stay toasty.,Bipolar

45497,I'll never kill myself but I'll never live either. Not functioning. Live in isolation can't face the world or anything stressful. Mostly because there is nothing I want in it. I don't try. I do the absolute bare minimum to take care of myself. Thank God for my overprotective mother who never wants me to leave. But this also enables my avoidant behavior I won't push myself to overcome my anxiety and do things because I don't have to and don't want anything enough in the first place. So I stay in my comfort zone. I just exist. Every day the same in hiding really. I don't see suicide as an option however I'm getting desperate.I'm seeing a psychiatrist for the first time soon but I'm afraid it won't be enough. My family situation also isn't the healthiest but I feel really helpless on my own. Also have adhd and anxiety to the extent that nearly everything overwhelms me. I'm very childish and couldn't imagine handling the responsibilities of living alone. Is anyone else as pathetic as me? I have no friends no dreams no desires no motivation no stability inside my mind or outside of it. I need to bond with someone desperately but who would ever want such an empty person?

46363,I feel like bipolar is ignored. Anyone know any good mental health nonprofits that actually support bipolar? I've liked TWLOHA since I was in high school because of their dedication to preventing suicide and they were really connected to the music scene I was into but now as I'm older and diagnosed I'll listen to their podcasts and watch their social media and there's nothing that ever acknowledges bipolar. Just depression and anxiety. I feel like most organizations are this way. They support anxiety and depression because they're the trendy things to support while things like bipolar borderline and schizophrenia are still too scary and inappropriate to mention. I'd really like to see an organization that recognizes bipolar and supports more mental illnesses than just depression and anxiety. Anyone know of any good ones? In the US so ones available in the US preferred.,Bipolar

I have been extremely reluctant to start the medicine because of the dumbest reason ever the notorious weight gain. I take care of myself pretty well with the exception of a few beers every other weekend or so definitely nowhere near drunk. I go to the gym 45 days a week and eat relatively healthy. I just recently lost a few pounds and am still trying to lose more personal preference I'm a healthy weight. I drink probably around 10 glasses of water a day. Does anyone have experience with weight gain on the med? I read online that part of it can be attributed to an increase in sugary drinks to accommodate the extreme thirst but I only drink water with a cup or two of coffeetea in the mix. I'm pretty nervous I know that the good outweighs the bad 10 fold but weight gain is not something that I would take well.,Bipolar

But right now I am having an issue with a boss at work and it is really throwing me for a tail spin. At least before when I had crazy anxiety I was used to it but given how stable I've been the last few years it's SO overwhelming. It's a tough situation without a possible solution at the moment I'm basically just caught in the crossfire of my two bosses fighting with each other and it's so tense and uncomfortable here that I feel totally out of control.

45487,An Unquiet Mind There is a particular kind of pain elation loneliness and terror involved in this kind of madness. When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones. Shyness goes the right words and gestures are suddenly there the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease intensity power wellbeing financial omnipotence and euphoria pervade one's marrow. But somewhere this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast and there are far too many overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern.

I also think I have some bipolar symptoms although I'm not attempting a self diagnosis or asking for one I'm just curious if people here can relate to these experiences.I'm 21 now and when I was 14 while being hospitalized I went through a time for months years where I was convinced I would be some sort of Steve JobsElon Musk type figure. I'm pretty sure I was manicexperienced grandiose delusions. I can see this now but sometimes still have these kind of experiences it's like I'm looking for the ultimate purpose or meaning to my existence and it feels pretty great when I feel like I've found it for a bit but it doesn't stay that way consistently. Idk how to describe it exactly but kind of like there's a missing puzzle piece sometimes I think I've found it and feel very driven other times it feels like the puzzle is in disarray. Also I'm curious to hear from anyone who knows what it's like to dissociate sometimes when I dissociate I'm just completely numb but other times I think there's hints of mania... where I'm stuck in my headdissociated but planning and ruminating frantically at the same time.Also things like lack of sleepdrugsstress often give me extreme paranoia normally not lasting long but sometimes months. I was concerned at one point that I might have been part of a government mind controlilluminati thingand I'm still not completely sure I'm not.

45676,Psychosis triggerd by bodytherapy Hi GuysI have had a psychotic episode 2x. In between my recovering fases I noticed that massage therapy was a trigger for me too sliding back and loosing it. After I noticed it the second time I called up some masseuse therapists and came to find out They have a contraindication for massages. Meaning they dont do massage therapy on people who have psychiatric problems. The reason being that massaging the body does something to the mind. It can release emotions that are stuck in your body and these emotions can trigger you.That was really a bummer for me because whenever I was stressed and needed relaxation I would take a massage.I have been looking into things like Meditation Reiki Breath therapy and Bio energetica. But often their is a contra indication.I wanted to know if any of you also feel their is a body mind connection? And that things that happen to your body can be a trigger. Would love to hear experiences. I would do anything to stay stable amp healthy. But I need to find a way how to cope with stress and how to relax my body in a way it wont be triggered.,Bipolar

46089,I need some advice My boyfriend has bipolar 2. Lately I've been noticing that his episodes of depression have been getting progressively worse. He's been missing work and sleeping most of the day away lately. I tried to encourage him to go to work this morning. I even told him to take it one step at a time and I would be there encouraging him throughout. He immediately said no. I tried telling him the same thing but with a different approach and he still said no. He started to get aggravated with me so I backed off. I've noticed that he's been getting slightly aggravated with me lately when I try to be encouraging so I'll back off and let him do his own thing once I detect it. The only reason why I try to encourage him so much is because I'm so used to doing it whenever I'm dealing with my own depression. I love him so much but I don't know how to fully get through to him without seeming to aggravated him. Can someone please give me some advice on what to do. Thank you in advance,Bipolar
45501,The fog has lifted but I can't tell if it's stability or hypomania After my meds stopped working about a month ago I returned to another awful mixed episode. It was my first period of stability since I first had symptoms two years ago and I've been so afraid of how long before it would come back. How long I would be useless and unable to function in mixed state hell. I had some med changes last week but I thought I would never be stable again. But this afternoon something changed. It's like my eyes opened wider my senses were heightened my energy levels quadrupled and I now desire to do things. I finally took that shower I couldn't take all week. I was joking around with my family all day and having deep laughs that actually hurt. It felt oh so genuine too. It's not all better my paranoia's still there and I was a bit delusional today. Feel a little antsy. My flashbacks of my mania have continued at about the same intensity as well. The thing is the first time I was stable it felt a lot more subtle and not as sudden. It was great since it was the first time I had felt like a person in so long but this is something else. I feel so disconnected to how I felt just yesterday it's like it never happened. Like I've been feeling this good forever and I just woke up from a bad dream. The recent med change was increasing my lithium from 900mg0.6 level to 1200mg0.9 level. When I was first put on Lithium at only 300mg I had the same high I'm experiencing now is that typical? Also added on 50mg seroquel but can a dose that low really do anything yet? It might seem overwhelmingly obvious that I'm hypomanic right now but idk. For one I haven't been hypomanic in so long recently it's either been manic or mixed manic. Also I feel more in control compared to when I was last hypomanic. More selfaware and hopefully less annoying. Then again maybe that's because I have more experience with this hell now. Idk I really want to just savor how good I feel but I'm kinda worried ,Bipolar

46031,Recently diagnosed I never really thought that I had anything other than depression that came and went but after something happened a few months ago I figured I would talk to a professional. After talking for a while she diagnosed me with bi polar disorder.I always just thought that the periods between depression were just that but she pointed out some things that I never really noticed occurring during the times that I didnt feel depressed. like extremely high energy not sleeping really really obsessive behavior. I get super into one thing or another and thats the only thing I can focus on for like a week and after that Ive lost all interest in it. Like a while ago I started researching how to brew better coffee. Next thing I know Ive spent nearly a grand on coffee makers and different coffee beans and am making like 10 cups a day its all I could think about. About a week later I have no interest in touching any of it and I start feeling depressed again. Sorry if that sounds weird that was just an example. She asked me to do research on my own to see if I think that fits but Im not sure. I figured I could talk to other people who are also diagnosed. ,Bipolar

I was going to switch to another Rescue drug until I read that. Ive just realized I could be bipolar recently. Doc prescribed an antidepressant and I havent come down yet. I am now 72 hours without sleep. But in all fairness when I was revving up I decided to binge drink for two days. Im not freaking out. Im just completely unable to close my eyes. I am also full of anxiety. Im sure this is what smoking crack meth cocaine would feel like. I also have been unable to eat or drink. Im going to see the doctor tomorrow. What can I try in the mean time? Ive been watching documentaries. Reading. Ive been getting rushes of feel goods that make my hair tingle. Adrenaline? Maybe?

I have experience in none of these things whatsoever Im a psychology major Ive been listening to as much new music as possible to try to be inspired and be able to have an adequate soundtrack Ive decided that I need to completely overhaul my life. I need to read more write more be around people more which means quitting my usually very isolating job in order to gain material for my screenplay. I even went as far as to drive 30 minutes to to look for a homeless man that I met two weeks prior outside a bar because I had an interesting conversation with him about Arthur C Clarke . And as far as my screenplay goes Im obsessed I think about it constantly but I cant think of a plot or characters or setting my mind just goes around in circles and runs into walls but its very important that I get it done. I started bidding on film equipment on eBay. I spent an hour crying in my car yesterday because I miss my friends and none of them are available to see me and I feel isolated. I keep forgetting to do important things I have major brain fog. I get distracted by everything. Its becoming sort of a hazard at my job at this point Im trying to judge whether I should take some time off. It happens in April without fail I dont know why Im surprised.

You can read the article here httpwww.bbc.comnewshealth37166293From the articlegtInflammation is part of the immune system's response to danger. It is a hugely complicated process to prepare our body to fight off hostile forces.If inflammation is too low then an infection can get out of hand. If it is too high it causes damage.gtgtAnd for some reason about onethird of depressed patients have consistently high levels of inflammation. Hayley is one of them I do have raised inflammation markers I think normal is under 0.7 and mine is 40 it's coming up regularly in blood tests.gtgtThere is now a patchwork quilt of evidence suggesting inflammation is more than something you simply find in some depressed patients but is actually the cause of their disease.

Made 200k at 19 years old and then I just... stopped explored other avenues particularly women.A hypomanic episode occurs about every 2 years and everytime it's like an 'upgrade'. It lasts about 5 months and everytime I shift my focus onto something new. I'm 26 now survived 6 episodes and the current focus is management... I am now an ENTP previously an INFP and originally an INTP. Bipolar is a doubleedged sword the best and worst thing.My job has helped a lot paid for therapy and etc. They're used to it a lot of people in logistics go nuts. But I'd really like to control this better.,Bipolar
45498,Can your mood change in a day not rapid cycling Is it just me or do you find you can be normal one day and depressed the next and stay in that depression for months on end. I'm not talking rapid cycling through mood. Just it takes a few days to change from depression to mania and you stay there.,Bipolar
45859,My brother is manic how do I help Hi guys using a throwaway. Recently my brother got into a fight with his girlfriend and I feel like he's super manic right now. He just bought a 20000 BMW after trading in his volkswagon bought 1000 of gucci stuff traded in his phone for an iPhone X and is just acting strangely. He's being rude to my mom saying really hurtful things for no reason to her I just want to see how I can help get him back to baseline. He planned a trip with his gf to leave to Florida which had been planned back before he started acting like this and my mom and I feel nervous about him going. It's not like we can force him to stay because he's 21 he's an adult but still. All of this is really stressful for everyone involved so I wanted to see how some of you have coped with this in the past or if anyone has advice for how to help him through this. Thanks,Bipolar

45806,The Lithium struggle bus I have fluctuweighted many times in my life but I was by far the fattest towards the end of 2017. I've been steadily shedding pounds but a couple of weeks ago I started taking Lithium again. And while it's helped the mania as of yesterday I've entered a new world of despair about my bodySo this past weekend I suddenly put on at least 10 pounds of water weight after binge eating socially and consuming hella sodium I wish I could sue myself. I was also dehydrated because I'd been vomiting from the startup. My body quickly blew up like a balloon my favorite sweatpants even became tight. I was uncomfortably bloated all over I think the more fat you have the more water you retain. Including my face which felt heavy amp the bags under my eyes were dark as hell.So last night I drank a LOT of water thinking that would fix it. But it only made everything worse. I peed 10000 times then went to bed. This morning I woke up and was pleasantly surprised with how tiny I looked. However then I realized that my boobs looked different. They're still heavy but squishier and hang a little lower. And my stomach is squishier. I can barely feel fingers against my skin now. My face has more wrinkles my neckchin curve feels loose. I feel like I've aged years overnight.I fluctuated a net amount of at least 20 pounds in 2 short days quickly up then back down. And now my skin is stretched too big for my body!?? If it is this loose already I'm terrified to keep losing weight. I know it happened so fast. Freshman sophomore year I was so thin and beautiful and taut. Im a senior now so I was already feeling shitty before this happened. Feels like I've lost myself. Who is this bitch in the mirror with the body of a postpartum mother of quintuplets....???? I've never come close to having a kid let alone 5. Yet here I am. And I don't know if I should try to fill back out a lil or what?Or does anyone have experience like this? I'm in despair.,Bipolar
45682,roommate possible BP with Manic episodes? Long Story short good friend of mine we were friendsroommates for 4 years on and off while we were in different states. He always seemed san while like everyone had his bugs. During few weeks when he used quiet a bit of LSD some DMT he changed...First couple days he was hyped up with some grandiose ideas.....from whats you would explain with ambitions up to thinking can control internet has allergy for wifi and stuff like that.... After couple days of bad sleep some weed it would get worse and come back again. At some point he would come up to me fell asleep at tv as says you and your dog have to go.... and one time i was able to explain him thats is was delusion... Another time he became violent and almost attacked me with a knife which is another story. It seemed to calm down after that and even he acknowledged the irrationality of his behavior. Today i was on the edge. He txted me and asked whether i saw hi wallet? Is looking in kitchen replied no not here. To which he demanded that i look better and then said that i should go for a walk and find his wallet. I was tired of this shit and started getting dog for a walk and putting shoes on. He became violent saying everything here is his and shit like that. Started grabbing dog who started to bite him to which he went manic saying see he bites me ill sue you for 1 mil and again tries to take my shit away. I fought him off and went for a walk with dog he followed me and started grabbing attacking me to take my dog or what not. At that point we were 500 yards from house on street... he was saying like stop resisting you know what im capable off there are cars driving beside somebody can die.... at that point a moto cop drove by and stopped long story short they let us go. I didn't try to press charges.... but what can i do? Lately his sleep is better but in 1 minute there can be a change in mood and sometimes with delusional thought and all kind of stuff going on. I myself have been sleep depraved last 14 days... trying to manage my life... and his.... and im not a nanny. I can't move out for another month or two? He himself doesn't have family here in states but basically isn't self sustainable and im afraid of him being so unstable....Anything i can do? Do you think it sounds like he could be BP? Im thinking of contacting his parents for any advice... but as i said they are overseas.,Bipolar
45896,Disability with Bipolar Disorder I have a general question about being Bipolar in the work place. I was diagnosed with Bipolar type II about a year ago and I currently have a job but am looking for a new position. While filling out my apps there is a mandatory question where they ask if you have an kind of disability and Bipolar Disorder is on the list. I'm very hesitant about identifying myself with a disability. I was able to stay on my dad's insurance with a letter from my doctor but I'm not sure what applies for this. I'm really nervous about letting any of my employers know I am Bipolar. I'm pretty good at hiding my illness but I have depressive dips that last for a few months and they affect my work. I'm on medication but currently I've been having hormonal issues that I'm dealing with my gyno. I get very antisocial and irritable but I am afraid of my work trying to get rid of me if they knew. I know they technically they're not allowed to but I work in the Biotech industry and they can be very cutthroat. I don't want to not be hired for a job if I was upfront with being bipolar. I also do value my privacy and I don't want the whole world knowing about my illness. I was hoping someone out there has been dealing with this issue and can offer some advice. Thanks guys! ,Bipolar
46049,Psych doc put me on Buspirone. Thoughts? Experiences? I've been in the midst of a serious depressiveanxiety ridden phase for weeks now. Rather than increase my Cymbalta and risk a manic episode the doc put me on Buspirone 15 mg 2xs a day. This shit sure works. And by works I mean I'm too damn tired to do anything. You can't have panic attacks when you're dizzy and laying in bed 18 hours a day. I called up my therapist and told her I'm discontinuing the Buspirone. The psych doc will be calling me tomorrow. Has anyone had experience with this medication? How much did it effect you? I feel like I'm back on seroquel and that's NOT a good thing.,Bipolar
45834,Looking for resources on being supportive Coming from nba after viewing a mental health post there.I'm looking for knowledgeresources on how to help and be a support system for my girlfriend.She let me know beforehand that she was bipolar and gave me opportunities to not pursue a relationship with her. I really care about her so I let her know I appreciate it but that I'd really like to build something with her.Most recently she lost her meds when I was visiting and it totally shook her. One night she started to have a manic episode Idk what the correct term is and she was crying and laughing and rolling around on the bed.I tried to comfort her but honestly I had no clue what to do. She couldn't talk after a point and was texting me saying it felt like if she talked that she'd completely lose it. She needed me to leave so I left but I felt scared and awful that I couldn't do anything for her. I didn't want to leave also because I was worried about possible suicidal tendencies.I feel like this is something I'll have to talk to her more about but atm she isn't ready to open up about the topic and I don't want to force the issue just yet.I'm stuck in between wanting to give her the space she needs and wanting to do everything I can to become the support system she needs. I don't feel her family provides her with it.Sorry this got longer than I wanted but what are some things that I can do to help? What helps those here that go through this?Apologies if anything I said was politically incorrect I'm here to learn and soak up the knowledge. ,Bipolar

46142,It's not all in my head Along with bipolar BPD PTSD and panic disorder one of the big things I've been struggling with the past few years is chronic pain. My old PCP wouldn't take me seriously and kept telling me to take Tylenol and lose weight.I had an appointment with my new PCP yesterday and my blood test results came back. My vitamin D is very low and I also tested positive on a blood marker for autoimmune disorders. So bad news is I probably have something like fibromialga. Good news is it's not all in my head! I've struggled with pain so much that I really thought it was psychosomatic at this point.I cried yesterday after taking gabbapentin. Even marijuana does not take away the pain like this drug does. For the first time in many years my joints don't hurt I don't have aches all over my body. I feel like a huge weight is lifted and I just wanted to share with you guys. I woke up today at a normal hour I've been sleeping upwards of 14 hours a day for months due to paindepression and wasn't in pain for the first time in as long as I can remember.I feel like this is going to have a huge impact on my mental health. I've been in a depressive slump for a good year or so with little blips of happiness. I feel like I can do things and be happy again. ,Bipolar
45958,What to do? I'm on an upswing and I think I'm way too high into the swing now. I got pretty much zero sleep yesterday and I've just been gogogo since yesterday morning. Like super intense in everybody else's faces passive aggressive get the fck outta my way on a freakin' mission. I feel like I'm going to explode at the first person who opposes me but I'm also super excited and happy about everything and I just have so many great awesome ideas on how to improve my business and diversify my market to I really am going to change my industry if I could only grasp and hold on to some of these ideas for more than a god damned second. But man they're going way too fast I cant even write them down but I can feel that they're great ideas! Everything is just speaking to me so clearly and everything makes sense now and everyone knows I have these great ideas and wants to hear them.But I know I'm manic and I know some of this is exaggerated but I don't know where that line is. I don't know if I want to know where that line is. Why should I stop? Why should I filter myself or slow myself down just for the rest of them? But I can hear it in my hubby's voice that I need to dial it back a bit at least. I don't know if I can though. I don't even remember what I was going to ask anymore so I don't know if anyone could make sense of this and figure it out and read between the lines but I feel like I have a deep connection with all of you so I think you guys know what I'm saying. I totally love you guys like love love. Like I'm pretty sure I would be jumping all of you guys LOL. Cool beans good talk. Have fun tip your waitress,Bipolar
45681,The Calm After the Storm A year and a half ago I had a long pyschotic episode followed by a BP diagnosis and several months of depression. I had to take a year off of college but Ive now been back at school for almost a year. With everything thats happened the medications the extreme emotion levels the social isolation for an extended time Ive found myself at an interesting place. Anyone else find themselves constantly having to maneuver through conversation just to avoid a long intense topic about your past? Specifically related to your bipolar?CH,Bipolar
46148,How can I best support my mom? My mom has bipolar disorder. She can be stable for long periods of time but when she gets sick she gets very sick. My parents did a good job of shielding me and my little brother from her illness. Now that I'm older how can I best be there for her?,Bipolar
46166,Hey Im new here! I just wanted to ask some questions. Does anyone go through the whole range within a few weeks? Ie a I presume brief period of hypomania to the depressive stage to anxious to eventually normal to then swing back round to it all? Im in denial and dont want anything to be wrong. Ive had from what I remember in the past two massive depressive periods the childhood one I cant remember too much about it. The last one I was physically ill with it. My mil likes to remind me of how my body was here I most definitely was not. Any manic episodes I have managed to keep myself in check but this is I presume the anxietys doing. I have an irrational fear of repercussions that and a poor credit rating and normally contain it to getting new pets or some other thing that is a huge distraction. If I had access to money I dread to think. Drinking I can go where I literally want to drink ALL the time to never wanting to touch it I also get suicidal after drinking a bit like how you feel after a manic episode where you just think what a dk youve made of yourself and the shame over what youve done well what you remember anyway I still dont know a lot about this illness only recently been referred I see the mental health team every week but I kept fobbing them off when bipolar was mentioned Im not bipolar! And for anyone from the UK we pretty much only have Stacey from eastenders as point of reference facepalm . I never act out on suicidal thoughts health anxiety there too.Also does anyone forget a lot? Eg I literally washed and changed my daughter shes 1 12 and literally 5 mins after I couldnt remember what all I did.. did I change her nappy? Did I wash her? Did I brush her hair for that one I can see her hair has been brushed but I can remember doing it I forget if I have eaten went to the toilet. Work I struggle so much. I get anxious over it I cant face them when I go back after being off sick. The looks Im given the questions as to why I was off and if Im feeling better all in good heart but I get so ashamed I cant manage. I struggle to get up and ready to go in. When Im there I struggle with deadlines and adherence everything is timed. I accidentally got a new job in a completely different sector where Im looking after people with dementia. How Can I actually look after people when I can barely manage to look after myself? Im treading water and poorly. Ive four kids the elder three are teens and theyve to help me so much as my partner. Im terrified of another massive depressive episode as before as I CANNOT spend another year or more not here I struggle talking to doctors about this so will be glad when I finally meet the clinical psychologist whos been assigned to me.Also cbt doesnt seem to work anymore i cant take hold of my thoughts which in turn make dealing with them impossible..Whoops sorry for the dissertation here! ,Bipolar
46197,Slowly getting worse idk what to do Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this I just need advice on what to do my mental health is rapidly declining even with medication most likely due to the severe toxic environmentrelationship I'm in with my partner. I'm 26 and I dont know how to leave we are on a lease together or where to go. My parents live in town and say I can come live with them again but they are toxic in their own way as much as I love them. I dont have any close friends who I could get a place with and I'm pretty much broke even though I'm on disability for mental health reasons. I wouldn't be able to afford my own place unless I went the sect 8 route which I dont think I can due to the waiting list in my area being over a 2 year wait. I've spoken to my therapist about all this and she never really has any solid advice other than you have to do what's best for you and I'm at the end of my fucking rope I just need some direction on what to do anything would be helpful. I'm trying my best but damn.,Bipolar
45858,Father was BiPolar Manic worried. Hi so my Dad was diagnosed as bipolar manic a few years ago and has spent his time in and out of hospitals for the past few years It's always been in the back of my head that I could have received it too. Sometimes I feel at the top of the world and splurge on very useless things and spend a lot of my money other days I feel the exact opposite and just want to curl up and stay in my room all night. Is the disease genetic? just worried I don't know if im just sad at the time or if what im experiencing isn't bad compared to what being bipolar is.,Bipolar
45757,Scared to Start Meds Hey all. Ive been in therapy since age 6 Baker Acted at 15 sent to inpatient treatment at age 17 stayed for a year for self harm depression and substance abuse.In inpatient they just said I needed to find god and quit smoking pot and life would be dandy. Then the inpatient program took me off my depression and ADHD meds because I traded adderall for a cigarette. Life was miserable.So I went straight to university after inpatient treatment genius move and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I think that the diagnosis is fitting but I dont trust it completely what if its BPD or Cyclothymia? Fast forward a year I dropped my therapist. School is tough because Im either so hyped up I think that I dont need school because Im a genius and a god among men and can do anything I want with my life. Other times Ill miss a week of classes and do no work because I hate myself and want to die. All in all Im so used to dealing with the symptoms that I dont want to take meds or go back to therapy because Im scared of the side effects. I dont want to lose my sex drive or get fat or be lazy. I dont want to give up drugs and alcohol. And Im really distrustful of doctors because not a one has helped me in the past. Tldr Im fucked up probably bipolar barely passing my classes but dont want to experience side effects from meds. What do I do ,Bipolar
45784,Am i bipolar? ive got a doctors appointment booked but im so nervous im thinking about cancelling Ive recently been experiencing moods which could suggest i may be bipolar even getting to the point where i almost ended a 13 year relationship with my BF in which we have 3 children together because I felt i didn't love him anymore only to now fall madly and deeply back in love with him this all happened in a matter of 2 months and i have had this cycling feeling for almost about 2 years now but its seems like the moods are getting stronger and i am now acting on them. Ive been hiding my depressive moods from people so no one really knows whats going on only my BF i now tell him everything im feeling which i think has helped massively so far and he is so supportive.I also have rushing thoughts daily but ive just always put that down to that just being me i just thought it was normal.i can also have obsessive thoughts and this could be on a certain hobby or person my BF i will think about it all day long and my brain is hard to shut off at night sometimes. i always have to have the tv on to fall asleep to distract my brain.i get rushes of creativity and productivity. i can be super excited and obsessive about a projects only forget about them and almost never finish what i plan to do or have started. i end up losing all interest.I find it hard to concentrate for too long and i get easily distracted and im very forgetful. My BF made a doctors appointment for me because i was to nervous that the receptionist might ask me what the problem was and i know i would have freaked out if she had asked me and i don't know why Now im really anxious about this appointment just incase i tell the doctor everything and hes gonna tell me im being too dramatic or maybe not even believe me. im having my BF come with me for support but i know im gonna get so nervous im not gonna be able to speak because i know im gonna forget all of this.Any insight or advice i would be so grateful for. I have been doing some research on bipolar in one respect i would feel really relieved if it is bipolar but then on the other hand its super scary to think i could have a mental disorder as i have been completely healthy all my life and never thought i would ever have something like this. Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer some words of wisdom.,Bipolar
46382,Is feeling like someone or something isn't quite real to me a sign of something? If so what? I started lithium 450mg a week ago today. On Sunday night I wrotegtGood. But I've noticed all day and a little bit yesterday that it's weird that other creaturespeople are alive. I have looked at my dog a few times and my brain is confused that she is real. That's probably not good? The feelingthought fades and doesn't worry me. I'm not getting manic about it. Like I don't gaf that it happened. Whatever. I believe she's real. I'm taking my meds. So I'm confused as to why that would happen.Nothing else weird had happened. I was with my husband all day and he didn't notice anything strange. Is that a normal feeling to have or is it something that comes along with having bipolar? Im sure if it is it will continue to fade as I level out my lithium levels.,Bipolar
45967,Random extreme passions is it a bipolar thing? urenagadethrowaway recently made a post about extreme passions to things that evaporate very quickly and I was wondering if that is actually caused by the bipolar disorder as it seems some people in this community share the issue or is it just a personality trait that has nothing to do with the disorder. I havent found any research on it what do you think?,Bipolar
46291,Is it bipolar So heres the deal. Im grappling with the variation of depressionanxiety to elation and feeling great. Ive pinpointed that its about a 67 month cycle and I figured Id put it out here to see if anybody else has similar storiessituations. For the last 5 years Ive had 67 months straight of feeling depressed high anxiety suicidal thoughts with plans isolation and a general urge to just shut myself off from the world. One time I went without talking to my parents for like 6 months. Then all of a sudden Ill wake up elated and happy and itll last for about 4 months. Then the cycle starts again. Right now I feel the depression starting back up. There was a trigger to my depression this time around but its really suck for the last few days making me afraid Im heading into another cycle. Im so tired of it. And Im in a position where I cant get professional help. So I cant figure out if this is a depression thing suicide thing or bipolar thing. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks. ,Bipolar
45748,Lamictal literally saved my life but one side effect is.... Within ten months I tried to end my life twice. After seeking treatment I finally got lucky and a new doctor diagnosed me correctly as Bipolar Type 2. I've been on Lamictal for about two years now and I can't begin to describe how it saved me.I'm now an advocate for mental health in my day job fighting to protect what little protection our healthcare system provides I'm an American clearly.Anyway about four months ago I started noticing a very small and slight downgrade in my vision. It doesn't effect my driving ability but it does mean I have trouble tracking fast movements on my television.Action scenes are generally fine if a bit hard to track but 2d sidescrollers like Mario are a MESS let alone Sonic lol. Its almost like I see objects trail behind me. I'm worried that the symptoms will get worse. I take about 250MG daily so a relatively low dose from what I gather.How can I treat my loss of vision if indeed it is the Lamictal? I went to an optometrist and he confirme that my eyesight is largely fine so its not that.,Bipolar
46365,Discussion of Suicide Trigger Rant Those wellmeaning but ignorant people who repeat anecdotes about people who survived jumping off the bridge realized all their problems could be solved except gravity ed. And the trite majority of people who attempt suicide are glad they didn't suicide. And any other platitudes from Chicken Soup for Suicsplainer's Soul shut up shut up shut up.I'm not even suicidal right now but it pisses me off to no end to hear people reciting 4th hand wrong shit in an attempt to shut down conversation about this. Some of it doesn't even make sense. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem? Last I checked bipolar disorder is a permanent problem. ,Bipolar
46191,Happy New Year! Here's my Resolution I want to notice the times when I am alright. Really notice them stop to think hey my mood is okay right now I'm not anxious and I'm safe. Taking a moment to just feel my body and appreciate my surroundings. This has been so helpful to me lately. I'm climbing out of a small depression caused by a medication problem lithium level got a bit low while tapering off another med. I'm also kind of stressed out by some life stuff outside of my control it's not terrible more just annoying but I don't like it. I kind of have to realize something always comes up. There are no perfect stretches of time where work isn't stressful a social situation isn't stressful etc. But I have a roof over my head food in my pantry and love ones around me. I want to notice that it's okay right now.There are three times when a potentially bad thing can hurt you. You can get anxious before it happens if it happens. You can have it happen. And then you can ruminate and dwell on it. I know I can't always control what happens to me but I do want to get better at reducing anxiety and rumination. When I think back on events I want to tell myself a story that is neutral not one that makes it worse. I don't want to invent problems or spin existing problems out of control. It's hard but these two things are my mental health resolutions for 2019. I want to appreciate the good moments and I want to do my best to ensure that bad ones only hurt me once.Disclaimer I'm talking about my own anxiety and rumination over small problems this isn't meant to dismiss traumatic events that you will naturally feel a lot of anxiety around and ruminate about. Terrible and traumatic things happen. This is more about not spending the entire day worrying about something inconsequential. ,Bipolar

46024,Doubting my BPII Diagnosis Apprehensive About Meds Feeling Like a Fake TLDR Im afraid that I was never hypomanic in the first place and it was all in my head Labelling Theory my current medication while effective is dulling my moodscognitionmemory and could be dangerous to keep taking in the longterm if Im not really bipolar and I dont know what to do.Ill preface this by saying that Im not seeking medical advice or rediagnosis just venting and looking for general advice or shared experiences from people who know they have bipolar. I dont feel comfortable opening up to my therapist about this because she doesnt believe me and I have a strainedweird relationship with my psych. Apologies in advance for the wall of text.So history. I was initially diagnosed with MDD in late high school but had recurring episodes since age 13 put on Zoloft and once I titrated up on a higher dose I started to feel restless and hyper to the point where I wondered if those were side effects. So I googled and found out what hypomania was. Even though a lot of the symptoms were similar what I was experiencing wasnt as harmful or destructive. I also did not experience the two suspected episodes for very long maybe 45 days TOPS. In fact I was very productive and somehow ended up doing paid work for this relatively wellknown animatorillustrator on the internet that I wouldve otherwise never dared to message out of the blue. So I wasnt too concerned. It was psychomotor agitation and racing thoughts that made me uncomfortable but those arent exclusive to hypomania. Other stuff happened but I dont want to write a laundry list of symptomsactions.But then I saw things like Even if you have the slightest concern it can turn into fullblown mania!! Especially if you have a bipolar relative!! and my anxiety kicked in. I stopped seeing my psych for unrelated reasons and cut off my meds. Then something traumatic happened which triggered a year long depression. So I got a new psych that diagnosed me as BP2.However in retrospect Im wondering if I exaggerated my hypomanic symptoms and made myself believe I experienced it after researching it. What if that euphoria was really just the happiness from getting out of a depression and accomplishing new things in life? I got second opinions from other professionals who disagree with my psych and suggested ADHD dysthymia or even a vague personality disorder big NO for the latter. So Im confused.Its been a year since Ive been on medication Lamictal and Klonopin and Ive been tracking my moods on Daylio. Aside from good days bad days and occasional daylong blips of intense moods its so purple. Neutral. But Im functioning well! Im so glad that I have not been suicidal for so long but it feels as though my emotions have been dulled or flattened. Happiness is just mild contentment. Seeing other people cry at a funeral without being able to feel their pain feels so uncomfortable. If I were truly bipolar I would have definitely had at least one hypomanic episode by now but it hasnt happened. With these meds I also get brain fog every once in a while and I feel that my memory is much poorer.I was actually thinking of switching to another psych I live far from my current one and my mother hates her so that I can explain my situation and try something different. But if my current medications are working to an extent is it worth it? If Im not actually bipolar staying on this medication for the longterm might do more harm to my body than good. No matter how you look at it all of this is risky.Does anyone have any personal experience that is similar to this? Thoughts or advice?,Bipolar
45932,Trigger heavy i guessDepression is back again. And i'm scared. I was doing so well. I got back to school. Life was going fine.I wasted 6 years doing nothing because my mental health always gets in the way and DESTROYS everything.But out of nowhere it all comes back again. School is getting harder day by day. The first hint of melancholy has transformed into a cold apathy and desire of self destruction.I cannot handle failure this time. Not again.I usually don't self harm because i really dislike self inflicted pain even though i am a masochistic by nature but i still managed to stab straight into my cephalic vein just so i could bleed.This is not me. But i never know at what state my mood is in before it is all too late. I feel the same as always. But all the signs are there.The spark happiness and light is gone and now i just feel this disgust. This is the darkest and most ominous my depression has ever felt even if it isn't the most severe it has been.I want to rip out my guts. Bleed out all my blood. Set myself on fire. Just purely destroy myself.This can't go on. I can still prevent this from getting worse but i don't know who to reach out to or even that should i. Everyone is too scary. I feel like i just need to hide and wait for this to pass instead of getting into trouble by talking to people.Sorry if my text is a bit incoherent or rambly. I don't even want to think about these things much less write about them and it makes my brain go fucking haywire. I just need something external to tell me this is not okay because i never feel that anything is wrong even if it is hitting me in the face. Be it escalated moods or bedridden depression. I just never feel my own moods.,Bipolar
46343,My sleep is dwindling I dont get much sleep but the past few weeks I sleep an average of five hours and ten minutes. Im just not tired at night. Im taking my meds. How can I sleep more?

45489,Maybe I should throw up my meds more often! s When I was last at the hospital 2 months ago the docs increased my Latuda from 60 mg to 80 mg. I immediately started experiencing nausea as soon as I took it so my nurse gave me that minty Maalox stuff that you drink out of a little cup. They said that my body would adjust to the higher dose and to just give it some time. Well the nausea didnt go away and Ive thrown up my meds twice last night was the second time and experienced nausea andor stomach pain every day or almost every day. They said to take it with food and I did but it didnt make a difference.I also got a phone charger that lights up for Christmas and its brightness was preventing me from getting good sleep. I thought I could put it as far away from my bed as possible and not have it affect me but it was still too bright. Throwing up meds ? days of unrestful sleep due to too much light from the charger waking up at 4am and completing 5 of my Chinese lessons restlessly pacing the house for an hour straight and then doing 200 crunches nonstop. Mind you I am someone who barely exercises so this was pretty out of character for me! My parents were concerned at first but then we all joked around about how Id get a 6 pack and I should start my own fitness plan manic state recommended but not required ??. I admire them a lot for their strength and composure in situations like these. Feeling restless and like you cant sit still even for a moment without screaming is pretty uncomfortable but at least I was able to get that energy out in a positive and productive way. I ended up getting in 5000 steps this morning so thats pretty good! Only another 5000 to go So Im going to put the charger in a different room even though I dont want to because its really cute and talk to my psychiatrist about lowering my Latuda so I dont have as many stomachrelated side effects. I also need to make a commitment to myself to exercise on a more regular basis. I was going to the gym every day for a few days but then I got sick and couldnt do anything for almost a week. Im feeling better now so Im going to get back on the bandwagon. Thanks for reading! ,Bipolar
46469,not wanting to take meds? i want to get better! i really do! there's no excuse for me not taking vraylar at allall i have are two days of community college a week. i impulsively quit my job hi mania so i don't have to worry about being excessively tired while in retail. im just over being drowsy amp needing to nap every day. everything seems overwhelming too. i hate feeling that way. tbh there's a part of me that wants to stop seeing a psychiatrist amp just use weedalcohol to help out. i daydream about getting high a lot. it's detrimental i know! i know drugs aren't worth it and hurt instead of help! but that's where i'm at rnanyone else have that feeling during the trial process?? is there something wrong with me??,Bipolar
46058,Questioning Medication? This probably isn't a universal experience but since I've been on meds things have gotten a lot better. I still have the swings but I can manage to get through them without hospitalization now. But... I really just want to go off my meds. I feel like I might have been making up how bad it is. I want to see if I can survive without them I hate the idea of being medicated for the rest of my life.,Bipolar
45451,Can you be manic with low selfesteem? tw suicide Hey everyoneI just spent a night in a psychiatric assessment unit. Before admitting myself I hadnt slept in 90 hours not because I couldnt but because I didnt feel like I should. I wanted to keep being productive which is interesting because I was also too anxious to do things that I actually need to do reply to emails and texts do work selfcare and hygiene. This resulted in three terrible nights of organizing parts of my room drinking cutting exercising writing and beating my Tetris high score. I created more art and wrote more than I ever have in such short period of time. I kept making plans with friends setting goals etc while fully conscious that I would be too emotionally drained to do any of them the next day which just lead to disappointment. The whole time I was awake I was surging with adrenaline and didnt feel tired. I wasnt getting hallucinations or feeling sluggish like most people report after not sleeping for 3 days. This was especially strange because I usually feel tired after a normal 8 hours of sleep due to low iron plus I was only eating 500 cal a day. Instead I felt alert and was able to do math homework write go to work etc. One weird thing was that my train of thought was totally off..one second I would think Im getting out of the bath in two minutes and immediately follow that with what am I doing in two minutes? or Id be surfing reddit see a recommended website open a new tab then forget what I was doing. The second night I was awake I had this really strong urge to kill myself for about two hours very different from my normal passive I want to die thoughts this was like a primal irrational urge and I then spent the rest of the day totally out of it like my brain was in a different place. I immediately forgot the details of those two hours after they happened so I cant even really describe it in detail. This whole notsleeping episode came right after a few months of feeling extremely depressed unable to perform basic activities or care for myself too anxious to go out or go to classes.Anyways all that to say that I met with a psychiatrist while I was in the unit and she was considering the possibility of bipolar disorder I am already diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Bipolar disorder is not something I have ever considered before. She was worried about putting me back on antidepressants in case it triggered more mania. What held her back was that generally you should feel an inflated selfesteem during manic episodes but I didnt feel that at all. I hated myself and felt more suicidal than ever before. So my question is is anyone here bipolar and feels low selfesteem during manic episodes? Is this possible? As a 17 year old going off to uni next year GAD and depression are already enough to deal withI truly hope I do not have BD. But if I do Id like to figure it out ASAP so I can start getting it under control. Thanks for any help!,Bipolar
45689,My college is keeping tabs on me and it's making me anxious... I'm a business student at a local college. Last semester I found out that one of my classmates or professors had anonymously reported me to the school for strange behavior of some kind my meds give me hypoglycemia which can make me slur words or seem tired.Since getting that email I've never had social anxiety so badly. It feels like I'm one careless comment away from a hospital stay. I dont know who reported me or even why. I suspect everyone but simultaneously feel like it's all in my imagination. I had to leave class today because I felt everybody's eyes on me. It feels like the well is poisoned. I'm not sure exactly what to do at this point.,Bipolar

45584,Trying an alternative route to recovery in case meds don't work out I've been on a bit of a rollercoaster for the past couple of months being switched on and off various medications I posted in here a while back about going on quetiapine and immediately having to be taken off it because it gave me hallucinations and battling through referral systems to try and get therapy and a diagnosis. I've finally been referred to a neurologist and a psychiatrist but the psychiatry appointment isn't til May 31st my doc's pretty pissed off he'd requested it as an 'urgent appointment' UU so until then it's basically up to me to keep myself stable. i've started keeping a bullet journal where i can track my moods am using dbt self help books every day meditating every night have quit alcohol and this morning started at a yoga class i'm trying literally everything that mentallywell people have been telling me to do for years. do any of you have any lifestyle changesnatural remedies i haven't mentioned that work for you? i wish i could rely on meds and therapy to get me through but the healthcare system is so slowmoving in the UK that i feel i should have a backup plan and also it doesn't hurt to fill my life with things other than antidepressants sometimes. i don't wanna turn into one of those 'you don't need drugs nature is the real antidepressant' kinda people but if it turns out those people are correct then i'm frankly quite happy to be wrong if it means an easier way to recover lol. i hope all this makes sense i'm a rambly person when i'm not in a depressive phase,Bipolar
45469,I'm so broken right now TW TW suicidal thoughtsI'm stuck and scared guys. You know that first question they always ask you any thoughts of hurting yourself or others? well I always answer no with the addendum of thoughts however I would never want my family to find me like that or deal with the pain. But recently the thoughts are getting worse my mind won't stop racing heart pounding I'm crying one minute then angry I'm getting little to no sleep my paranoia of being watched by my neighbor and others is getting worse ya stupid I know can't help it. My psych doc I saw just last week and told him I'm really really struggling and don't think the meds have been working I'm so depressed and anxious and I've been waiting for them to kick in fully for almost six months. He did not address my anxiety I brought up my meds not working three goddamn times and finally he said let's wait another month and see if it gets better. I can't wait another month I'm in pain so bad mentally and physically. I'm tired of this I cut my hair super short again so I would stop pulling it now but now my skin picking has doubled and that gives me anxiety about getting help because I'm worried they will think I'm on drugs cause the picking. I went to a inpatient facility in July last year and it didn't help at all I have been so scared of them doing nothing while I sit in a strange place for another ten days not getting better. Last time the psych doc took me off my anxiety meds as soon as I got checked in because he didn't like them and despite many freak out the clinic left me to cry hidden in the corner of my room for hours multiple days. Psych doc kept trying to put me back on seroquel even though I told him it makes me freak out he wanted me to try it anyways I did it did nothing but make me panic cry and my heart felt like it would burst my BPM was 168 thought I was dying. I want to go hide for the rest of my life I want this misery to end. But I'm kinda stuck right now and it's making me panic more out of indecision. My mother is very ill can't walk well and I help her my brother is also mentally sick and I keep him together when he gets nuts. My mom is struggling right now goes to court regarding disability soon so she's nuts and we were talking and I'm saying it's getting very hard for me daily to even live. She said she knows and is very sorry and shed suggest more but she's crazy right now and can't deal with the added stress and I told her OK. But I don't know if I can. I'm so tired of fixing everything else besides myself I feel guilty about needing help feeling suicidal feel like a failure. I want help but I'm scared they won't do anything or flat out ignore me again. I'm very scared and unstable but I feel so fucking guilty if I leave to get help because my family needs me to take care of things they are like little children if I am not around I am in my mid 20s now they can't do shit it seems. Sorry I'm frustrated and rambling but at my wits end and could really use some advice. Thanks.,Bipolar

46023,I feel like this is killing me but still no one listens..? I am convinced that I have been suffering from bipolar since the age of 19 I am now 21. I don't think I'll make it to 30 I just can't see it happening. I've been cycling between manic episodes which start off fun and then end up making me irritable paranoid and delusional and then crippling depression where I lie in bed all day feeling like I'm burning in the fiery pits of hell and each year it seems to get more intense. I can't hold down a job or maintain a relationship for more than a couple weeks. I can't afford to feed myself a lot of the time. After waiting for months I got to see a psychiatrist who discharged me after I told her I had been smoking weed saying I had a substance abuse problem but not addressing the underlying issue which I believe to be bipolar. Luckily I live in New Zealand where we have sweet welfare benefits which are just enough to put a roof over my head. I basically feel like when I kill myself it won't be because I had mental health problems it will be because no one would help me. People willl say at my funeral oh if you were struggling with depression why didn't you tell someone even tho in actual fact it's basically all I ever fucking talk about and no one listens. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so confused and just feel stuck. ,Bipolar

45783,UK Just been referred for assessment by my doctor as possibly bipolar. Does anyone know what will happen now? Will I have a telephone consultation then a meeting for an actual assessment. What is it like to live with bipolar disorder? Or bipolar 2 disorder?I'm currently being treated for depression and anxiety and have previous alcohol issues. I don't think I am depressed though although I have periods of depression. On reading about bipolar disorder I think it makes SO much sense as an explanation of my behaviour and feelings and my doctor agrees. To make things much harder we are leaving the area in 6 weeks or so and my referral will have to be transferred to the new place we're living which might delay things. My doctor warned me that a diagnosis isn't a quick fix 'medication sorted now you're fine' sort of thing and I have to make changes to my life also to make myself happier and well but this feels like a weird sort of relief.,Bipolar
45870,Hypomanic and leaving the country I have been stable for a long period of time without medication.My doctor has been wondering if I really am bipolar or if it has always been my ADHD that has been the problemLyrica basically saved my life I was in a constant state of anxiety and it really helped me but after 2 years things started to go so fats in my head I lost a lot of weight excelled at work and college and took on to many responsibilities and I crashed a couple of weeks ago.They put me on concerta and it seems so calm my head but I'm still feeling tingly inside and I'm horny as fucksorry i sleep around 78 hours I don't feel I'm better than anybody else and I can listen in a conversation but I'm wondering if the lyrica and concerta are pushing me into a hypomanic episodeI get these intrusive thoughts but ofc I don't act on themI am leaving the country in 2 days for a school trip to Girona and I'm afraid I won't be able to goDoes anybody have any advice on what I should do can I do something to calm myself down before the trip?

45574,Bipolar and Shift Work...thoughts please Hi i understand that its not the best idea to work shifts like a 2 day then 2 over night then 4 days off. But i need to do this for my job. If i stay on my lithium and use other drugs as needed like sleeping pills or antipsychotics to make sure i sleep after backshifts i think ill be fine. Keep in mind i will be very carful of getting the rest is need and that after the 2 backshift i will have 4 days off. So in total of 8 days only 2 of them i will be working overnight.Also keep in mind that i have been working a 6am start shift every second week and 10am the next week for 5 years and get up at 5am for that somtimes after only 4 or 5 hours sleep and have done fine.It seems to be mostly getting stressed and not taking meds drinking too much coffee or drinks that has cause me problems in the pastThoughts please,Bipolar

45861,Does anyone else diagnosed with BiPolar feel that your doctor essentially treats you like having emotions is a privilege you are no longer fit for? They always give meds that basically zombify you. Joymania sadnessdepression. They act like youre just not allowed to feel anything anymore because youre a danger to yourself. It really makes me feel that theres no way out of this constant cycle and I really just dont want to do it anymore. Euthanasia would be so much more favorable of an option to me at this point but if you talk like that you just get sent away to be around people that make you feel even worse about yourself.

45400,Family question diagnosis vent Start with the stuff that isnt as bad.Mom and sister have asked what makes me bipolar. I hide basically everything because nothing good has really came out from opening up. Planning on talking to my sister about it as I trust her more. I beat around the bush uhhh... Bipolar symptoms.... I think they just want to know whats wrong but Im anything but comfortable talking about it especially with more than one person.And then theres my dad!I accidentally told him because I said something about my antidepressants while I was on a high. He asked who told me and I told him a psychiatrist. Didnt go too much farther. Whatever cool. I asked him a bunch if he was upset because he didnt look very happy he said he wasnt.Two days ago he said something like Ive never seen you have a mood swing. Took me off guard really irritated me. You dont need to see me have a mood swing for me to have them. You dont need to see me hitting my legs and crying because I feel Im awful and no one loves me for me to have an actual problem. Hes seen my self harm before do you think that magically goes away? Oh I act fine but that doesnt mean I am. And he has definitely seen me in my highs. When its night and all I do is talk and talk more than normal? Bipolar isnt necessarily severe mood swings and acting off of them anyways.Then last night he decided to turn it up a notch. I said something that must have riled him up. His response was that I was making him tripolar.What the fuck???I told him thats not how it works and its not in the DSM and hid in my room.Seriously. What the fuck? Do you not even care how your daughter feels? Do you not even care bipolar is characterized in part with depression that was obvious when I was 1215 and you did nothing? Even when I had cuts all over my damn arm? Do you not care that I was in enough pain to go to a psychiatrist? That I have low self esteem that you say upsets you but if I do anything about it suddenly my issues dont exist? Do you even think bipolar exists?Thanks Dad.You really made me feel loved.I want to break things ,Bipolar
45567,I FEEL GREAT worked out changes in my routine So I stopped seeing a doctor for a while. When I was with her she kept me on Lamotrigine the generic one got me up to 200something mg. I also was prescribed some Stilnox which was totally awesome if not for my shitty depressive episodes where I would try to sleep all the time and all the mania where I just wanted to hallucinate all the time. Anyway! The Lamotrigine made me feel so fucking awful. I was a zombie for the longest time. Felt no emotions no sex drive I was pretty absent as a girlfriend which led to the demise of a really great relationship no motivation to do anything from work to studies et cetera. It wasn't working so she kept uping the dose and also asked me to take some Inderal to calm down the increasing anxiety I had.I stopped seeing her as I've mentioned. It wasn't just the medicine but it was also because I just didn't feel comfortable speaking to her anymore. She wasn't super awful or anything. There were just subtle instances where I would feel shitty about some things she'd say. Since the break up I realized I needed to get help because I was so not mentally healthy at all. I stopped seeing her in the middle of my relationship because of reasons listed above but also because I refused to believe that there was something wrong with my brain. I just wanted it to all go away and convince myself I was normal. Currently trying some different doctors looking for The One. Meanwhile This is probably not advisable but because I can't wait between appointments I started self medicating. Went totally sober. No alcohol no cigarettes no weed which apparently turns BPD people schizophrenic or something? Which sucks because it was so great for the anxiety no popping benzos or any other drug. Started working out more consistently. Controlled my eating. I went back on the Lamotrigine BUT this time I started taking the branded GSK Lamictal. Started with 50mg. I paired it with 10mg of Inderal. I FELT SO GREAT!!!! I was having episodes all the time but this calmed me down in a nonzombie way. I started building a tolerance to it though I think? My anxiety would come back worse. Weeks into this routine I went up gradually to 250mg of Lamictal and 40mg of Inderal. I'm feeling really great. I know it's not mania. I just feel healthy and normal. I think it's helping me keep to my routine cope with my break up be more productive. I'm on my way to becoming a better person I think. Someone who won't let the big bad BPD monster win.,Bipolar
46409,The mixture I have bipolar type II schizzoeffective disorder adhd and severe anxiety. I take depakote lamotrigene geodon for this and hydroxizone for sleep. The hydroxizone does not work for sleep. Serequel and amatriptileye are too sedating the next morning. I am looking for suggestions on what to ask my psych. nurse for sleep. Do people recommend a psychiatrist as opposed to a nurse practitioner? I have not had much luck with nurse practitioners. I have been struggling with mania symptoms and panic attacks for a year now and have not found solutions. After my brother died in august I had a severe depressive episode that lasted from August until December and they would not put me on an antidepressant to pull me out. I was out of work from October to present because of this and panic attacks that have been out of control along with higher than normal blood pressure. This occurred when they put me on the lamotrigene. Higher anxiety and higher blood pressures. Any suggestions for all this mess?,Bipolar
46448,Reminded by earlier post I have Bipolar and also ADHD. Is there any hope for ADHD treatment? I have Bipolar I was diagnosed as BP2 but after an illness earlier in the year I feel like I may have had a manic episode over the summer but we'll see what the doctor thinks as well as ADHD. The mood stabilizers help but don't do a whole lot for concentration while the ADHD meds work for concentration but make me you know manic. I'm totally open for another medication besides the standard AdderallRitalin.

46123,Have you ended a relationship while manic and later regretted it? My now ex fiance isn't diagnosed as bipolar so I may be completely off. In fact it never occurred to me to think that our relationship which would be going so well for months and the would have a sudden two week period of intensely angry fights was the result of bipolar disorder. We had broken up about 4 times in 3 years always for just a few days but this time I was tired of fighting his moods. On our last day together while doing a last sweep after packing up our apartment he casually mentioned that his mum is manic. He had never told me that before.I was really caught off guard by the breakup we had just gone to a romantic dinner the night before and his temper seemed out of nowhere so after giving him a few days to 'cool off' tried to fix it and that's when I found out about his new girlfriend. He was screwing her in the bed that We were still sharing at night Awful.Since we split I found out he's cycled through that girlfriend and now has 3 casual ones. He's bought a car a new computer 2 TVs. This despite being really tight on money generally and having a bunch of new expenses since we're not splitting them anymore I can't think of how he could possibly be affording this besides maxing out credit cards. He's deleted all his social media sent angry ranting texts to his friends cutting off their friendship. Right before the breakup he applied for a bunch of jobs in exotic places he's normally sort of boring about where he'll go and was coming up with two totally separate outofnowhere plans to start businesses in fields he's not skilled in. Now I'm wondering if he could be undiagnosed bipolar. It might explain the sudden promiscuity reckless spending maybe even the bursts of anger out of nowhere We're in our mid 30s so it would be late to be diagnosed.Now that I have this thought in my head I'm obsessed with the idea that maybe he is sick rather than cruel and that he might come down from his mania and want to reconcile. I could forgive everything with a genuine apology and obviously a promise to seek treatment. It's been about 3 months since we broke it off. We split our stuff moved to seperate places and after getting sick of getting angry texts out of he blue I blocked his number. I'm not going to contact him he'd have to come to me. I guess I'm not looking for redditers to armchair diagnose but wondering do people who dump someone during a manic spell come to regret it when they've come down? I'm wondering if my hope for reconciliation is actually plausible or if Im just grasping at straws?,Bipolar

45453,Could I be bipolar? For years I've been dealing with what feels like cycles of depression. I'll descend into a deep depression over the course of 23 weeks and then immediately feel great but not manic for a few days before the cycle starts again. In the past year the depressions have gotten worse to the point of me attempting suicide twice and selfharming frequently. I now see a therapist and psychiatrist and they've put me on lamictal wellbutrin and abilify. I've tried several meds and lamictal has by far been the most helpful in keeping me emotionally stable without significant side effects.My psychiatrist has diagnosed me as having major depressive disorder. He claims I'm not bipolar because I haven't experienced any manic episodes but I don't feel like MDD fully describes my symptoms.Could I be bipolar or do I just have recurrent depression with mood swings?,Bipolar
45950,Looking for insight. My dad has struggled with bipolar since his teens. He's 60 now and I'm 36. I have some trauma from my childhood because of his manic episodes in which he became violent. I can remember at least 3 episodes where he had psychosis. My parents divorced but lived together on and off for years. Apparently my dad's doctor released him and said he was cured and didn't need any more treatment 10 years ago or so my mom tells me.Well fast forward to this past Thursday my dad had an episode of psychosis following days of mania and there was a lot of alcohol involved. He apparently hallucinated that my mom was screaming at him and being horrible to him and he's hospitalized right now. The police found him wandering the streets at 5am. I saw him Friday morning in the emergency room and he was still babbling on and on rocking back and forth and seemed to be scared of something I think demons possibly from what he was babbling about. Well he was given a shot and moved to the crisis center in the local hospital. I visited him today and finally got him to sign a release stating his doctors can talk to me. But he still believes that my mother was screaming at him and doing horrible things to him which are not true.I let him tell me all of this and my mom was there visiting too. I didn't say much because I needed him to trust me. He thinks there is nothing wrong with him and claims the doctors told him that he is fine and not bipolar at all and they've given him pills to calm him down. My mom said he can't come home and she wants nothing to do with him ever again and all of his care is in my hands now.Mostly I'm just venting here. I want to tell him he was hallucinating but he still isn't well so I'm guessing that's not a great idea. I feel he will come around and realize he was hallucinating but I don't know how bipolar works. I don't know what's going to happen to him now. ,Bipolar
46214,How did you know it was time to seek inpatient care? CW suicidal ideation Im in the pits. This has been the hardest month Ive had in years. The intrusive thoughts are occurring regularly and Ive started disassociating occasionally. But I dont want to take someone elses space in the hospital if my case isnt as bad. I dont know. Im all over the fucking place. ,Bipolar
45452,How long did it take to be diagnosed uk I am starting to write a mood diary before I go to my GP and beg to be looked at.I have throughout my life had what I think is bipolar. I'll have wonderful drive for a month or two and then over a day sometimws I'll go into a deep depression for months. It just happens and then I'll go back to feeling like I can take on the world etc. Rinse and repeat.During my highs I have enrolled on courses which I've paid for 1k and I'll do them and then I'll get into my depressive episode and that's the end of the course. I am hard to live with during my lows and fun but irritable when I am high.I should add though I do have some reprieve sometimes I just feel fine but that's few and far between.,Bipolar
45779,i think this might be mania again and i'm scared i've been very stable for the last months and i'm on my medication but in the past few days i've been sleeping for 23 hours per night and even though it's not time enough to guarantee i'm having a manic episode i'm sure that it's not normal. this just can't be normal. i keep feeling a weird rush my heart is racing all the time and i'm breathing fast even when i'm laying down. my head hurts a lot but when i drink coke it stops. today at my spanish class i thought my book was an ipad and started touching as if there were buttons and i was hearing the professor talking in french. i can barely talk coherently because there's too much in my mind and i forget things almost immediately. i've been studying obsessively lately to distract myself from how miserable my current life is and well it's been working so far but i also feel like i'm developing dementia as if my brain is not capable of storing so much information. holy shit this must be mania again.,Bipolar
45802,I'm an idiot and I am pretty sure I've become a burden Long story short at the beginning of this year I went inpatient I didn't know I was bipolar because I wanted to kill myself. Over the course of the past two months I have been forced to resign from my work. I wasn't stable and did not have enough FMLA time. I broke it off with my boyfriend I realized after four years he was mildly emotionally abusive and I am currently cat sitting for a friend but I have been here since midJanuary. I feel like I have way overstayed my welcome here. I was going to go a couple of hours back to my original city and stay with a friend. I think I got confused and she got upset and felt her boundaries were broken about me staying too much. I feel like an asshole. I feel like I probably just lost a friend and I didn't mean to overstep. I let her know I meant no harm and I thanked her for her help and wished her a good night. I hate this illness. I am going to be flying out to my brother's on the 12th to be with his family that isn't triggering stabilize and get ready to come back and move in with my best friend once I find work. I have a couple of friends I am staying with a couple of days before I fly out but for that first two days I think I will just sleep in my car. I feel like a complete loser. I feel worthless. I don't want people to think I am using them. I'd rather curl up in my car than lose my friends. Sometimes it feels like it would just be easier to be dead.,Bipolar

46424,Content with the idea of suicide. Here's why Content with the decision?Hi everyoneFirst time poster and visitor. And suicidal. But not in a sad angry sort of way. Let me explain. I have a myriad of uncomfortable growing and lifelong genetic disorders that aren't obviously visible. I have lumps everywhere that may be cancerous and I'm currently in the process of finding out. I also have type 2 bipolar disorder. My teeth lips mouth tonsil and throat structures are all shades of fucked meaning I'll need multiple surgeries braces and apnea machines in my future. My family has a history of a few kinds of cancer heart problems liver problems balding and Alzheimer's. I'm freshly in my twenties so thinking about how ugly this can get for me is seriously worrying and a complete drain on any vision I have of the future. But that's not really the primary reason I want to leave this world. I just feel complete finished done. Not in a depressive way at least not all the time but in a closure final chapter sort of way. I have felt nothing but love from family and friends have had many successful relationships have had a super privileged life and have set myself up for a decent future after Uni. However I just don't care. I'm content with the time I have spent here and would rather burn out than fade away. My medical issues will surely put myself and my family into debt. My studies feel worthless even though I am excelling and they have always felt that way. I never thought I'd make it past 18 and have no real vision of myself past 21.Every day feels like unnecessary time to be spending. I feel like I should close my book and leave while I am content with my life up to now. Have any of you felt this way? Any suggestions or comments? ,Bipolar
45686,I'm new to Seroquel. What can I expect? Hello I am seeking some insight into the short and longterm affects of Seroquel. I'm being treated for anxiety depression and mood swings following a traumatic brain injury to the front right forehead. Anyway I saw for the first time a new doctor and she prescribed 50mg Seroquel to take at night for bipolar and to help me sleep. Well I cant say what its doing for bipolar but it is making me sleep like a rock. I mean knocks me completely out 0.51hr after taking it and then I'm sleeping for 1012hrs before waking up or coming to at all. Is this a normal reaction to the early stages of starting this medicine or what? Thanks for taking the time to read this and double thanks for any replies. Life is Great.,Bipolar
45751,I had to quit my job Rant incoming. I just need to get this out and share. I'm medicated and pretty well stable for the last 5 years. My job was so incredibly stressful the last few months. I was coming home every day with no energy to cook dinner or clean and mostly just spending my evenings watching tv and or crying. I didn't know what to do. There's an extra element of stress to a stressful job when you're bipolar as I don't know if the job is really the problem or if I'm going into an episode. My 1up manager was away on a Friday so I spoke to my 2up manager and said I wasn't coping with the stress and would like to hand in my resignation. I didn't ask for any special treatment just offered my resignation. He asked me to just think about it for the weekend and we'd discuss it again on the Monday. On the Monday he brought my 1up into the discussion. They offered me some leniencies and said they'd figured the job might actually be a 2 person job back when they hired me and they'd reassess the business plan and asked if I'd be happy to stay if the job was cut in half. I said I couldn't offer a commitment but I'd be willing to try. At the end of that week I heard from one of my colleagues that my 1 up had told him that I spat the dummy and didn't want to do the hard work anymore. I was furious. I was humiliated. Not only was my supposedly confidential conversation with management not confidential but it was totally changed to make me look like a whiner. I spoke to my partner and he agreed this was not on and that I need to get out of that place. So I took a week of stress leave sick leave officially. During my week off sick I received 47 not a typo! calls from work from people expecting me to do things and make decisions. While I was sick! I realised the only time I was badly stressed during that week was when I woke up and had that instant dread of thinking I had to go to work and when I received a call. Otherwise I felt ok. I called up on the last day and resigned. Today is my 5th day of unemployment and I am so so happy. I feel almost back to normal again. I still get stressed if I think about having to apply for jobs but that's ok because I've decided to give myself at least 6 weeks off to decompress from that stressful job before I start looking again. The point of this message no job is worth more than your mental health. Save money! Be prepared to be unemployed for a while if you need to because shitty jobs will come along and you need to be able to get out. I've never in my life been so happy to have some savings and I don't mind if I blow through it all over the next 6 months. I'm just happy to be out.,Bipolar
46092,Bipolar Parents are your kids Bipolar as well? Whats that like? Ive always said I never wanted to have bio kids because Im afraid of passing along my lessthanideal illnesses to them fibromyalgia ADHD amp Bipolar I its a tough combo to deal with. Also I had an emotionally abusive and neglectful childhood growing up so all of my coping skills and all of the help I got I had to do myself.However my Sister In Law is pregnant and Im so emotional and excited for her that Im starting to reconsider. What is it like to parent while bipolar? How do you cope while cycling? What measures do you take to make sure youre raising your kids in a healthy environment i.e. not villanizing them not losing your temper with them when you dont deserve it etc.?Also do any Bipolar Parents have Bipolar Children?

45557,Citalopram for Bipolar 2 intense Depression? Have you tried it? Hey friendsSo I've had a BP 2 diagnosis for many many years. I was extremely badly depressed towards the beginning I suppose you could call it. At the time Lamictal helped me beyond my wildest expectations. It gave me many years of being able to live and work productively.Fast forward to the present. I have been ultradian cycling for a few months. Basically my illness has progressed and is keeping me from working or even doing basic things. So I turned to my pdoc for help. Despite the chance that an antidepressant may have to flip me into hypomania the risk is worth it right now. I've started Celexa Citalopram which lists its purposes as intended for Major Depressive Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder PTSD maybe another thing or two.Has anyone had experience with Citalopram alongside a mood stabilizer? I'm extremely down and hoping for any help here.,Bipolar
45972,I gave up my old career in return for a happier healthier life. I went to medical school as a healthy bright 18 year old but within the first year I had my first major depressive episode and suicide attempt. At 19 I had my first manic phase a month long binge with multiple sexual partners drug use and irrepressible urges to study all night. Spontaneous and irresponsible acts were my forte I decided that Morocco was my spirit country and whisked myself off the next day. I gained a reputation amongst my friends as mercurial and fun but inside I was imploding my second suicide attempt followed the month after.In my mind the problem was Medicine. This stressful hypercompetitive environment was obviously causing my mood swings no way was this an organic health problem. So I left med school at the beginning of 4th year and began teaching Maths and I was great at it! This career change had solved all of my problems and I was tippety top flying high fantastic! Life couldn't get better right?Wrong. The depression came back harder than ever sending me spiralling down into a deep dark chasm. I was admitted to hospital and diagnosed properly treated and sent on my way a month later armed with mood stabilisers CBT worksheets and a new found passion for yoga. I thought I could just ride the wave surfing with the sun on my face when times were good and paddling against the tide when times got bad. I never imagined I'd be dragged under again.But I was. The stress of teaching caught up. The long hours the constant need to be 'on' and engaging the marking the data tracking the free time spent planning the expectations the meetings they slowly pulled me down until I was drowning exhausted from fighting the tide and ready to accept defeat.But three months ago I stopped fighting. I left teaching and I felt the wave pull me up lifting me toward the surface. Each day that I got up was a victory that brought me closer to sunlight. I chose to leave behind the stress that was threatening my survival and anchoring me to the ocean floor and I put myself first. In a few weeks time I start a job working part time as an activities coordinator for the same psychiatric hospital group that I was admitted as an inpatient to. I tutor for an online company and I'm happy.I'm not dipping and diving on the surf with the wind rushing past but I'm not inhaling salty foam beneath the surface either. I'm just sitting on my board content to be.,Bipolar
45860,Do any other women impulsively cut off their hair during episodes? I've done this a couple of good times but I'm so upset with the most recent incident which was in October of past year. It took me so long to grow my hair out and then in a mixed episode aggravated by Klonopin withdrawal I chopped it all off. ??During manic episodes I typically will bleach my hair you see and in my mixed state I felt like I should not be a blonde my hair should be it's natural dark color to reflect my depression or whatever. A rational person would have dyed their goddamn hair but no I cut it down to the roots. WHY AM I LIKE THIS? ??,Bipolar

And right now Im feeling depressed after an episode of non stop energy and I know its going to take a while for me to come out of this spell. Anyone have any tips. I was seeing a therapist but stopped going when after I was leveled for a while. Im on medication as well. Although Im on medication I went through a manic phase of high energy through the month of December. I didnt really notice. Im bad at spotting my moods.

45713,My ex boyfriend is bipolar. asking for opinion We broke up 3 months ago. I knew form the start about his state and I tried to inform myself about his disorder so I could better reach to him. At first we met he was in relathionship and I didn't knew that. We were just acquaintances but we liked each other. He had that conversation with me that he likes me and that he is in relathionship with that girl for one year and I told him that he shouldn't reconsider breaking up a serious relathinship just because he likes someone in that case me and after that it passed one month. We didn't had contact. Suddenly he showed up and it looked like he broke up. He told me that he is free and that he felt nothing for that girl so we started dating. He looked really really in love with me and I sstarted to love him. We had a great relathionship and everything went just perfect. but for one year. Than he had that cold waves we called that state like that. As he told me he had for a very long time a big problem with retrospective jelosy. Sometimes it affected on us. And sometimes he had a periods when he as he said felt nothing to me but that he cared for me. I gave him space and tried to understand and wanted him to be free to make decision if he wants to be with me. And our relathionship lasted one year like that. He never had a relathionship longer than one year. In our case we lasted for two years. But the second one was filled with all those cold waves he felt. And the last wave when we broke up I gave him a freedom again but it seems like now that he really choose to move on and it looks like he really don't love me. He made an instangram page and now after 3 months of break up he posted a photo with a new girlfriend. I can guess he behave a little bit strange and that he is just in his mood swing. But we were perfect match in everything else. We got along very well. I feel like he is my true soulmate despite his strange behaviour. Now I just reconsider if he ever really loved me? And maybe I supposed to be more dedicated and try harder to keep us together? Maybe I could do something to keep him close? But I was affraid to be intrusive with him and insisting to be together. I choose to give him freedom. Did I done the right thing? What do you think?,Bipolar
46149,Best friend needs me and Im not there long post My best friend recently moved to a new city and doesnt know anyone. Its ruining his mental health and Ive been getting midnight and 1 am texts and calls from him. My boyfriend doesnt understand that there is nothing going on and he needs someone to be there for him. I understand he doesnt want me talking to other guys at that hour but Im so conflicted on helping a friend or making my boyfriend happy. No matter what I do its the wrong decision. When I drink and fall asleep my boyfriend will wake me up saying I got a call or text and I will be in such a confused state I will state a ridiculous lie that doesnt even make sense. I dont even realize what Ive said until he starts yelling at me that I just lied to him. Last night my best friend called me twice and my boyfriend tried to wake me up and I told him some recruiter called me. Its so outrageous and I dont even remember saying it. This led to another fight about me lying and our relationship being put on the line. I cant keep fighting and being the bad guy thats ruining our relationship. No matter what I am always the one at fault. I dont think I can survive another fight with him threatening our relationship only to wake up and get told that he still wants this. Last night I got multiple texts and calls from my best friend begging for me to talk to him and he needs someone there. My boyfriend grabbed the iPad and FaceTimed him and told him to stop calling me and hung up. I was a wreck crying my heart out in our bedroom. I wanted to lock myself in the closet and call my friend and be there for him but we were in the middle of battling out whether Im lying or he wants this and how I was the one who needed to fix it. I woke up this morning and had a text from my friend telling me he had been cutting himself all night thanks to me. Why do I tell people Ill be there for them when clearly I cant keep the promise? Ive let yet another close friend down. I cant keep letting people get close to me. I ruin every relationship Ive formed with people because I cant keep my own life in check. I feel like the scum of the earth who doesnt deserve a damn thing. I want to make everyone happy at what ever cost and dont think about the reality of it. I want to rewind time and start everything over again and make it right. At this point I get to keep riding the spiral farther and father down. I could really use a high right now because this low keeps getting worse and worse. ,Bipolar
45561,I think Seroquel makes me manic Hi guys. Posted here awhile back about switching to Seroquel from Abilify bc I was so tired I couldnt function. Ive been on just 100mg of Seroquel for 2 months and holy shit..I went almost THIRTY percent over budget last month constantly picked fights with my now ex boyfriend etc. So all of that to say anyone have a similar experience? Im so fucking depressed too but not sure if I would be if pretty much my whole life hadnt completely gone off the rails lately. TIA yall ??,Bipolar

45475,Trying to fight through with no help. Failing miserably. I've always struggled with depression but this is the worst it's ever been. I can't really open up to my family because they aren't the best support. My boyfriend has been going through lots of stress and just spends his time in video games. I don't blame him. It's been tough I do not have health insurance at the moment although I should have it within a few months. The timing could not be worse and I'm trying.. so.. hard to remain positive. Despite having the worst depression of my life I've managed to stay interested in the things I enjoy. Recently I've grown more and more uninterested and numb. Today I don't feel like doing anything. I stayed in bed all day I barely ate and haven't had any water. I barely want to move. I'm thinking about suicide every chance I get and breathing feels like a chore. I don't know what I'm trying to get out of posting I just needed to tell someone. I need to go to a hospital or something but I can not. This is the worst feeling ever. Knowing you need help but can't receive any and being completely alone on top of that. Honestly my cats are keeping me going at this point. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy depression is a terrible terrible thing. I don't think I can even talk without feeling like I'm going to cry yet I feel so numb? It's hard to explain it. ,Bipolar
45797,Getting out of the house while feeling like shit Had grocery shopping to do..one of my least favorite things when I'm depressed. I pulled into a dollar store parking lot spot and noticed a car behind me wanting me to pull forward into the spot ahead of me making my car backwards so they could pull in and have my primo spot. I was parked correctly already parked and I wasn't going to pull forward. The lady sat there for 4 mins waiting for me. She finally sped off and went around the parking lot to the other side to pull into the spot she wanted me to go in and gave me the meanest glare. At this point my adrenaline kicked in and I gave her a thumbs up with a huge grin. I don't have time for weird shit and I'm not going to let someone bully out of my spot. But anyway she waited in her car for me to get out. She was twice my size and looked like she was going to kill me. Needless to I stayed in the car and ended up leaving because I didn't need a scene in front of my kids or harm done. The adrenaline on the other hand has kicked off a good sensation and for the time today I don't feel sad. Thank you scary lady for the uplift. ,Bipolar

45807,Back to the psychiatrist... I sat in the parking lot outside of work today and finally made another appointment with my psychiatrist after three months of quitting medication. I'm so tired of feeling depressed and angry and nauseous and paranoid. I'm in a mixed episode and my method of keeping my head down and waiting it out isn't working well for me.Music sounds strange. Voices and lights are overwhelming. Road rage spills out of me and I'm horrified but unable to stop...and when I'm not behind the wheel my feet drag I have trouble focusing every small task a huge ordeal. I haven't cooked in weeks I'm either overeating or not eating at all and I'm spending way too much money on delivery and drivethru's. I'm anxious and irritable and bitter and hopeless and yet I know logically that I have no reason to feel this way.I was on medication for six months before I stopped taking everything cold turkey. The lamotragine and wellbutrin had helped a lot at first when I was in a similar state last spring but I wasn't convinced that I needed them anymore or that my bipolar diagnosis was even accurate and I was a couple of weeks away from losing my insurance indefinitely.It's been a whirlwind of a winter. I went through it allEuphoric hypomania around the holidays. Huge spending not sleeping or eating hanging out with everybody falling in love lots of drinking and partying and being merry. I could so easily sink karaoke in front of hundreds of my coworkers at the holiday party or confess my love for my best friend or be curiously spontaneous. Followed by a crash. Depression. Self medicating. Waking up with a feeling of dread. Not wanting to leave the house go to work get out of bed. I quit my food industry job stopped hanging out with friends stopped replying to texts and calls.Started feeling better for a week or two before bam here we are. Mixed episode.I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want to be on medication or accept that I have bipolar but I'm willing to try if it gets me out of this horribly distressing mess. I don't know where to start except to post here and not be in the dark about what I've been going through these past few months as well as the past decade. And I'm fortunate to have a wonderful psychiatrist. It helps with going back.Words of encouragement needed.,Bipolar

45698,My 21f Doctors Keep Suggesting Lithium Hello everyone. This is my first time posting on here but I just wanted to say I really love the support community in this subreddit.Before I go into my questions here's a bit about my symptomsmeds I'm diagnosed as Bipolar 1 with rapid cycling. My current doctor has me on a very high dose of Lamictal Wellbutrin and Seroquel. Nothing seems to be helping right now the episodes are staying just as intense and quick and I feel like I can't get any relief.I wanted to ask all of you about your opinions on Lithium. I was seeing one psychiatrist for years that had asked about my opinion on Lithium and I said I didn't want to go on it. She dropped it after that and decided to raise my Lamictal. It helped temporarily. I ended up relocating kind of far away from her so I decided to see a new doctor. She also asked me about going on Lithium but I'm still really apprehensive. My concerns are centered around the fact that my grandmother actually suffered a Lithium overdose and she's never been the same since then. I'm so paranoid that that will happen. Has anyone with rapid cycling had success on Lithium? Does it really do the zombifying thing people talk about? The event with my grandma happened a few years ago are doctors more cautious with the blood testing and everything now? TLDR my doctors keep prescribing Lithium but I'm very apprehensive has it been successful for other people with rapid cycling?,Bipolar
46102,Can I just enjoy my hypomania? Havent slept in over 30 hours but I feel amazing. I had a really great day at work Ive been spending time with a pretty awesome guy and I just had a very liberating conversation with my ex at least at the moment...who knows if Ill regret what I said.For the last few months Ive been in a pretty dark depression. I didnt get out of bed shower or take care of myself at all. My life kinda went to shit and I felt like giving up. But today right now I feel on top of the world. I havent taken my meds and I know thats not a good thing but god I havent felt this alive in so long. The last thing I want is to be numbed. Can I just enjoy this for just a bit?

45425,Happy Event caused Depression? Okay so I'm kind of weirded out by this and not sure how to take it. I went to my psych doctor yesterday after having months of depression and we realized my depression started when I got engaged. She said major life events can trigger mood changes. I am NOT depressed about being engaged I am super excited and was waiting very impatiently for the day and couldn't be happier to spend the rest of my life with my fiance. She said maybe the wedding planning is what's stressing me out and causing the depression. I do tend to get depressive when I have to deal with my family a lot which wedding planning has definitely entailed but idk. I feel guilty for being depressed during what's supposed to be such a happy time in my life. ,Bipolar
46125,BPII dx as of today after 5yrs of unhelpful MDD treatment! Well I've been half expecting this for awhile and wondering how I'd handle it if things went this way. I'm actually relieved. This partial hospital program I'm in has really hammered it home that no matter what I'd be dealing with a chronic episodic illness whether MDD or BP so the only real difference for me outlookwise is I might actually get some effective treatment now. I might not be treatment resistant now. I might not have to do ECT. I could cry. I'm getting up there on Lamictal with a bit of Vyvanse and I feel just... normal! Or what I imagined it would be like. Here's to hoping it's only up from here. I was already fighting for my life so I know it won't be easy by any stretch of the imagination but maybe now I'll have better help. This community is something special. Thanks for everything thus far.,Bipolar
46201,Vivid Nightmares Ive had bad dreams since I can remember. I have journals from when I was 8 describing my nightmares. Consistently 5 nights out of the week. They flare and will be worse sometimes. Lately the past few weeks theyve become unbearable. Screaming in my sleep waking up crying or hyperventilating. More concerning I often have 35 min upon waking where I do not realize Im awake and I feel that it is very real and absolutely what is happening. I had a bout of post partum depression early in the year but have adjusted my meds and my day to day has been overall much better. Obviously the holidays are stressful for most but I feel that I handled it normally. I am terrified to fall asleep at night. I usually take sleeping medicine and have found they are absolutely worse when I do not take it. I figured out its not as bad when I take my lamictal in the morning but never the less they come every night. Obviously this is part of my life that I cant seem to shake but I cant understand why its been SO much worse lately. My question do you have constant nightmares? Does this just come with the illness? Is it my anxiety dragging into the night? Is there ANYTHING I can do?Meds Lamictal 13 yrs Xanax 10 yrs as needed havent taken in a month Ambien 10 yrs Vyvanse 5 months,Bipolar

46140,First time taking Lamotriginequestions I have bipolar not sure which type yetnewly diagnosed and I have been cycling rapidly lately. I just started taking lamotrigine and I feel like it made my depression and anxiety worse on the second day of taking 25mg. I'm not sure if this is just my mood swings or if it's the medicine. Anyone else have experience with this medication? Ultimately I'm going to ask my doctor when I go back soon. Just curious and impatient I suppose.,Bipolar
46046,My boyfriend is suicidal over Tinitus Hey peeps. I was wondering if any of you have had these same side affects. My bf has Bipolar type one and for a long time he was on ... mirtazopine? He was taking it for years. Back then they said that he was scitzo affect. Last summer he had a manic break I had to hospitalize him and he was finally diagnosed with Bipolar type one. They then took him off that and put him on abilify and Klonopin. The abilify was giving him akathasia so they gave him the klonopin. After a while as all mental health people seem to do is he went off his medication. This apparently by the doc was ok. Since hes type one if he leads a healthy lifestyle he wont get manic again and wouldnt need an anti psychotic. Great. Thats what he wanted anyways. So after a while after being off medications he get a ringing in his ears. Apparently this is a somewhat common side affect. He figured if he could just tough it out his brain would fix itself.He stayed off EVERYTHING for 4 months apart from his blood pressure meds but he finally broke and became upset suicidal and started drinking. He then took a Klonopin and it made the T's go away. Looking into it its a Glutamate inhibitor to level out with his Gaba.This would then make me think maybe hes addicted to Klonopin but he goes off it for months and then breaks down to take more again. 2mg makes it go away completely and .5 makes in bearable. I feel so lost. He now wants to seek medically asisted euthenasia and refuses to go see the psychiatrist because he thinks they caused his T's.Has anyone else here gone through this?,Bipolar
46019,After years of struggling with my own mind I finally decided to go see a doctor the other day. As we were talking he asked a bunch of question about my insecurities and anxiety my hundred of ups and downs. And by the end of my appointment he just told me that there was a lot of chances I may be bipolar. For now he gave me some pills for my insomnia he said that it could just be caused by the lack of sleep. A part of me wishes it does but deep down I know its more than that. And now Im just scared scared cause all I wanted was the doc to tell me everything will be normal but it wont it never is and I dont know what to do with that. Im just fucking scared,Bipolar

45862,I hate myself So I know this has been written on before but honestly just typing shit is a better outlet than anything else. Ive been bipolar I for pretty much my whole life crazy black out fits of anger when i was like 4 suspend from school till I was misdiagnosed and placed on adhd meds. Football helped the most just a pure outlet for all my rage. But now that im a married adult with kids I can barley function in the world anymore. My wife hates me and looks and treats me like im some sort of broken child. We havent had sex in months im 24 and buff as shit!!! She chastises me whenever I try to discipline our kid and questions every choice I make. AND I mean for anything like asking my kid not to stand on the counter. I cant fucking do this shit anymore Im suspicious of everyone arround me I day dream of just beating peoples skulls in for fun or anything to make my life have some kind of excitement. Pretty much just smoke pot all day for a chance to feel something like anything. But I live in the most conservative state in the country and pot is keeping me from holding a job. Im fucking bored of living not suicidal just bored to the point of depression taking Lamotrigine 100 mg does nothing but make me go to sleep and antipsychotics make me feel like im dazed and loopy but their great at night when my thoughts are racing so fast that i wont sleep at all. Does anyone else just feel like there is really nothing wrong with us and we are just meant to do way more with our lives maybe that is just the grandiose shit they talk about but I honestly feel like im capable of doing anything I want in the world and its other people that get in my way? Every person ive met that is bipolar is usually super rational in their choices but that could just be because we see the world as black and white and have almost no concept of grey. Anything can be rationalized to a right and wrong choice. Anyways I dont want anyones fucking pitty I like myself I just Hate that I cant trust myself to be a functioning human anymore. ,Bipolar
45662,Teeny tiny white lies? As a rule I dont lie to my girlfriend as I dont think thats a healthy thing for a relationship. However shes going to be awake soon its an LDR and is going to message me asking how I slept and if I tell her the truth that Ive been up all night and havent taken my meds or eaten shes just going to make a big deal out of it when it really isnt. I feel the best Ive felt in months today and Im kinda scared shell ruin it shes a very clever lady and always knows how to get to me if Im being noncompliant with meds or food. Is it really selfish of me to think like that when I would never lie to her about anything else? ,Bipolar
45465,Don't know who to believe.. I was diagnosed BP2 about 2 months ago after a very scary breakdown. I have always had highs and lows but sometimes reading about Mania is just not what I've ever felt. Maybe its hypomania but can't that just mean I'm energetic and feeling good? I know I struggle with depression and have all my life. After I got my diagnosis I got really up up up and dyed my hair pink and went out drinking a lot. Is that mania? Or just me? I always have had suicidal thoughts and my imagination is just really strong. Now the more I read about BP I am learning that some of what I thought was just normal are my own delusions or hallucinations. Like not everyone feels like this. Which also makes me question everything. Which makes me feel weird. I feel like I don't know who to believe. My psych definitely thinks I have bipolar. My SO also thinks I have it. However some friends I have told say that I am fine. That I am in a toxic relationship that is making me question my sanity. Now I've got all this lithium cursing through my body that is probably also contributing to me questioning my diagnosis. Is this just another one of those times I am trying to get myself off meds so in 6 months I can just start all over again because I actually need them? ,Bipolar

The noise of the world has died down and all i hear is my own breathing. I'm winding down like a machine falling apart. I forget what I'm doing and suddenly realise that I've been standing still just looking at nothing for god knows how long.The day before yesterday i almost got hit by a car and I didn't even flinch. I barely registered other people's shocked expressions and just kept going.I think that if the car had hit me I would've flown through the air and crashed to the ground with that detached look on my face still.I usually ride my bike bicycle with my 9 year old in traffic but i think I'd better take the bus for now.I know this is cause for alarm but i really have to force myself to care and take care.

I thought I was stable for a day or so because I was getting shit done but not going as crazy as usual on a hypo episode. But today... oy! I got like zero sleep and am currently wideawake writing this at 3am got up and ran some errands that i ususally do with my husband alone because I was annoyed that he was still tired. Like I wanted to kick him in the head because he was still asleep. And in the car I randomly started crying and couldn't stop until i started screaming. When i stopped screaming I began to cry again this went on for some time. My chest feels like it's going to burst open and every other thought I have is either God I just want to die please let me die or I should go buy some new razors. I haven't showered in...awhile?... and my room is absolutely disgusting which I would usually clean obsessively on a normal hypo episode but I just have zero energy. I can feel myself getting fatter and grosser but the thought of going to the gym make me want to throw up. Maybe it's just a light depressive episode? I just got out of one though man I would hate for another to start so soon! Love you guys hope you're all coping well and having a good new year lt3,Bipolar

I am in the process of getting in to see a psychiatrist in the new state but I have to see a case worker first and that is over a month away. I have been to the ERthey refused to help me and basically kicked me out saying they wouldn't touch my meds and said Benadryl would help me sleep and that would make me better.I have been experiencing severe mixed episodes mania and anxiety to the point of it crippling my life.

46165,Journaling Advice I've been journaling as a routine for a while now and I feel I need a little more structure. My typical entry is food caffeine nicotine water exercise sleep and how I feel.The static items regarding diet are fine I don't want to get granular there but for tracking the emotions I feel I need to better standardize what I am trying to say. Has anyone encountered this?For instance I can have entries that range from feeling scattered feeling lost feeling confused. Well really this is me saying I am confused. So I was thinking of focusing on Robert Plutchik's theory of 8 basic emotions and sort of seeing how that works for a while.The reason for this is so I can trend the states over time and see if that uncovers anything.Essentially instead of figuring out how I feel I have a list of ways I could feel then I just check the box.Any thoughts?,Bipolar

I'm diagnosed Bipolar 1 and two years ago I had a pretty severe psychotic episode. I've been on a various cocktail of antipsychotics and other drugs since. I'm not planning on stopping my meds anytime soon if I can help it but I was wondering if the drugs are the only thing keeping me normal. If I for whatever reason couldn't take or get my meds would I revert back to a psychotic state again as soon as the drugs were out of my system or just be more at risk of going psychotic again if something triggered it? ,Bipolar
45804,Bipolar II weaning off of Klonopin. Hi all. I was diagnosed with BP II disorder in August of 2013. My doctor initially put me on a regimen of Trileptal 300mg 2x a day. This did nothing to help my depression but helped me avoid instances of hypomanic.After a very failed experiment with Zoloft in late 2016 we settled on Wellbutrin SR 150mg which while it has helped my depression supposedly had the tendency to increase my anxiety. I would not have initially known however because I was also taking 1mg of Klonopin per day.Fast forward to October of 2017 at which time my doctor told me that he wanted to wean me off the Klonopin because extended use can cause cognitive impairment...which I was initially unaware of.After weaning myself down over many months to a quarter pill in the morning and a quarter pill at night I have found this dosage to be completely ineffective as to my anxiety. I have a very stressful job which does not help matters at all. To make matters worse my psychiatrist has effectively retired and I have to begin seeing a new but from what I hear very competent psychiatrist in midMarch.I dont know if this is relevant but I have also been sober for six years.I know that every person is different but what nonbenzodiazepine based medication have you taken to assist with your anxiety? Bear in mind that experiments with SSRIs have been a complete failure in the past. I am home from work today for the second day in a row which is causing me to feel extreme guilt for a variety of reasons.Thanks in advance for your help and I hope that youre all having a good day.,Bipolar
45550,My Checkup Was A Success Long Post The background story Since I was diagnosed over 10 years ago I've needed continuousongoing treatment and consultation. Changing dosages trying new medication talking through the most current triggers how to recognize avoid cope and foster healthy decisions. Gone through 4 doctors... when I was able to get an appointment and afford the treatment. I've gone some years withdrawing some entirely unmedicated new medication lower dosehigher dose self medicating at times. Having bipolar is truly debilitating and scary. Emotional Mood symptom wise last year was not as intense as I've experienced before. But last year was indeed the shittiest fucking year I have lived through in my entire life thus far. I won't list everything that was shitty. You guys know last year was horrible. My Mom almost dying before her liver transplant probably topped my list though. And my bipolar mania has decided to manifest entirely through my secondary symptoms of OCD. Chronic anxiety has taken over my usual depression and has crash landed directly on one main symptom. Self Excoriationdermatillomaniacompulsive skin picking.httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiExcoriationdisorder No exaggeration I look like the picture in that Wikipedia link just add breasts and some curves. I'm not looking for advice or guidance. I've been receiving the professional version steadily over a year and a half now. I just know that CSP is not common in this sub is often not associated with bipolar and is still considered co morbid along with symptoms of OCD.The point of my post. I saw my psychiatrist today. And he agreed that I have had very significant improvements since I last saw him. My episodes have been less frequent less intense and my depression has also eased up. My mania still keeps me awake throughout the week I get 34 hrs sleep at a time around 47am. and I literally sleep all weekend. But my job hasn't been suffering I've made three trips from the west coast to Texas for some extremely intense circumstances I've lost 30lbs and reduced my skin picking from my legs and lower arms to just my upper arms back and face although my face has had dramatic improvements as well. My checkup Achievement For the first time since I can remember my doctor isn't changing my medication and has said that I don't need to schedule a follow up appointment at this time. I will continue to have a steady supply of my personal med cocktail without worrying about running out. I'm under no obligation to pay for schedule drive to or stress about coordinating my life around another psych appointment until I feel it's necessary.TLDR Some yearssome decades are worse than others. If you can't remember the last time you caught a break don't give up. We all deserve peace and stability. Today was my day.,Bipolar
45655,A Letter to Me The following is a letter I have written to myself to help me battle intense depression. I write this and add to it when I'm coming from a much better place. If there is one positive thing that has come from this illness it is that the wild variance in mood has helped me gain perspective.Dear Here you are again. You've been dragged kicking and screaming into the darkness the abyss the place where there is only one way out. You barely eat lie in bed all day but hardly sleep. Ordinary tasks have become insurmountable. Even your bed to which you have been bound is no safe haven. Ideation and contemplation have reared their ugly heads. Clear your mind of these terrible thoughts for now. Remember that you have been here before. Don't forget what you have learned. Depression is not your enemy! You are mistaken. This immense weight you carry with you though debilitating now is a blessing in disguise. It is a badge of honor a shield that covers you from head to toe. Take comfort in the fact that you can persevere and survive this as you have done before. And when you leave this place don't forget to take the shield with you. With it you will find peace in knowing that you withstand anything because you have been to the worst place imaginable... and survived to write this.,Bipolar

46296,Reasonable Accommodation Frustration. To start off with I have a few different mental health disabilities. I am fortune that I am employed full time! I am also out about having a severe and persistent mental illness at work.However being in my office causes me some issues in being easily distracted by things going on around me. My disability causes some executive function deficits along with hyper arosal awareness... Not the sexy kind This summer my 5 year old was diagnosed with two chronic incurable autoimmune diseases. This of course has made mental health stuff worse. I was lucky to be in a DBT program when it happened or I'd be in a horrible spiral right now. I knew it would effect my performance and I asked my direct supervisor and manager about working from home 8 to 16 hours a week as an accommodation. At previous jobs this has been heart for keeping me up to date in notes. I was told that as an orginzation we do not have a policy for this.I said fuck it and worked from home anyways making sure I didn't go over my hours and got caught up. Woo! Over the fall we had a lot of staffing changes and I wound up with double the work load for 3 months. I have stopped working from home becuse I was worried in would get caught and get sacked. My performance has suffered and my new supervisor has noticed.I again went to my supervisor and director and was told the same thing about their being no policy allowing us to work from home. So I went to HR with documentation from my care provider. HR just now got back to me after a month. Again they implied they where but didn't out right denying the request. I've been in contact with an ADA specialist in my state along with AskJAN about this and it's super frustrating. The bestworst and most ironic part of all of this? Our orginzation serves people with disabilities. This is what we do for them and teach them what to do. How to obtain and maintain emoloyment. My caseload is only people like me who have a serious or sevre and persistent mental illness. Ain't that some shit? I love the people I serve and what I do and this is really leaving a sour taste in my mouth about the orgization. If you read this whole thing... THANK YOU for listening. I am so frustrated with the situation and I'm not gonna give up this fight. ,Bipolar

Recently I have changed jobs and spend the majority of my day alone in a car which has seemed to make things worse. I have unlimited time to criticize and berate myself. I don't really know why I am posting. I lurk a lot but am not very vocal on Reddit due mainly to my insecurity. I guess I just need the anonymous internet to hear me since I can't get myself to talk to anyone else about it. I spend massive amounts of time with the one person I hate the most me.

Doc didn't specify what type Now I've heard this before but since the meds never worked it couldn't have been true right? Wrong. New doc insisted I keep changing drugs until I found one and I did. BAM! Smacked in the face with reality. Coinciding with some late bills and my husband seeing that I had maxed out a 5k credit card in 2yrs frankly it became the week from hell.I've been depressed all my life and I've been on pristiq for years. My earliest memory is sobbing alone on the swing set at 3yrs old bc the Puff the Magic Dragon song just made me so sad. I never made the connection when my grandmother said my uncle's were manic depressive. My mother clearly is too and my mom would argue that my grandmother is a hypocondriact. Beyond that my mother is a person who should have never had kids. I was up for adoption but she changed her mind last min. Bad idea My childhood was badly bizarre to say the least.The above matters because I never wanted to be like my mother. Selfish. Reckless. Embarrassing. I made it my life mission to be kind polite and together someone dependable. But I now realize that I too am a terrible horrible person. I've been married 15yrs and he's no saint but I don't know how my husband has put up with me? Sudden remodeling projects I'd do while he was at work. Minimalism now! or Collect all the things! Thinking I can suddenly learn new careers amp then land a job immediately. Suggesting I off myself bc I bought too much cereal at the store and that alone is gonna throw us in bankruptcy surely. So here I am. Having a bad week at work. Wondering if my anger at other people's actions is warranted or if they notice my moods. Not trusting anything I think. Wondering when the Lamictal will start working and wondering at what point will it become too much?Any guidance you can suggest if you've felt like this is most appreciated.

45741,Need resources for my SO on my BPIILamictal I'm a 27 year old female who was diagnosed with BPII when I was 20. I was on Lamictal 350mgday for several years which did wonderful things for me. I also was briefly on lithium welbutrin seroquel trazodone and propranolol but always found Lamictal to be the most effective. Last Spring my boss decided to lay several people off including myself which meant I lost my health insurance plan. He didn't honor our Cobra agreement and subsequently my normally 30 refills skyrocketed to 800 per refill. I obviously couldn't afford this and thus went off Lamictal for 9 months. It was horrible I was suicidal had raging fits of crying and lashing out at people. I self harmed. I tried to walk onto a freeway. My boyfriend has been extremely patient and supportive but doesn't understand what I'm going through. I recently got a healthcare plan again with Kaiser and am now titrating back up I am on 25mgday now going up to 50mg in two days eventually back to my normal 350. I don't know if it's because I'm older now or that I stopped drinking or that I'm also on hormonal birth control Ortho this time but the side effects have been way more intense than I recall when starting last time. My night terrors are insane. Like I wake up sweating and panting and it ruins my day as I'm gripped with whatever got to me in the dream. I get headaches I have shitty coordination I feel lazy and unmotivated uninspired my speech is slurred and I have no memory. I'll be talking and midsentence just... not know what I was trying to get at. My boyfriend has my testimony to go off of but he really wants good resources to understand BPII and mostly Lamictal and what to expect in supporting me as I get back up to my therapeutic dose. ,Bipolar
46278,How often between med changes? A year ago I was out on medical leave for a major stress triggered episode and my entire cocktail changed to get me working again. I've had two severe depressive episodes since then but I take some extra Lamictal and ride them out. I think I'm in a mixed episode right now though and I see my doctor in two weeks I don't know if it's time for an adjustment or just ride this out too. The rage and anxiety next minute I'm holding in tears all trying to hide in the bathroom at work. I don't know.Lithium lamictal Lexapro tiny and topamax appetite,Bipolar
45404,Ketamine Therapy So the other day I'm on the net and I see an ad for a ketamine clinic that promotes it for bipolar but provided no information. I requested the science to support their claim and sent it to a scientist to back up what I had read. Thid scientist was also part of the DC ketamine trials and helped analyze the information. We were of the same mind. Good in theory but no real science to support their claims. With MDD and PTST sure but bipolar is a different kind of beast. Anyways I get a call from the doc that runs the cliinic. We talk for about 15 minutes and I get all my questions answered. They claim an 80 success rate. That seem super high for me. Also insurance doesn't cover it so it would all be out of pocket. I am a prime candidate but I'm not going to pay money to be a lab rat especially if there's a 20 failure rate. I would mean regular maintenence doses and stopping meds which scare me. Anyone done it? Any thoughts? I'm not looking for a cure but an effective treatment that's more effective than the meds I get to take the rest of my life.Like I said I'm just looking for thoughts and experiences.,Bipolar
45919,New job new problems So I recently got hired as a waitress! I love it and I rack in the tips all day so nothing to complain about there. HOWEVER I was blessed with the laziest coworkers ever. I have only been there 4 weeks and Ill be juggling 1012 tables all by myself because people just dont want to do their work. I do this while maintaining all the little tasks such as replenishing ice making drinks running food cleaning tables. I have no problem doing it and do it with a smile but it puts me under a lot of stress and it can get frustrating. Managers say its a work in progress but Ive yet to see any kind of improvement. Im fairly new to my diagnoses as well Im still learning how I function and what sets me off and how to work through the highs and lows. I recently discovered a new issue though. If someone comes at me I get into a fight or flight kind of mode. I used to be a snazzy biatch and tell people to pound sand but now my brain completely shuts down and I cry and try to runaway. I AM NOT USUALLY A CRIER OR A RUNNER. EVER. The incident that set me off last night was charging my friends card for 200 instead of 50 he was cool and we fixed it and then I had a coworker coming at me for not bussing HER table right away. She threw a glass at me and yelled at me in front of 20 people. To add to the embarrassment I had customers coming up to me asking me if I was okay. I wasnt and I went from a high to a low so I told my managers I needed to dip. Whatever that little scene she caused was messed me up. I drove 100 all the way home not caring what happened and Ive been in bed since then. I have to return to work today and I really have no idea how to handle the situation. My managers were understanding but how do I face everyone after theyve seen me at my worst? Ive also never had an episode happen in public or experienced a high and a low within the same 15 minutes. So I guess my questions are how do I handle it? How do I go back to work? And what do I say? And how do I get these feelings under control before they turn into a big problem? These are things I need to be able to control to be in a successful work environment and its something that Im really struggling with. ,Bipolar
45591,I feel like I'm overanalyzing I've been diagnosed for ten years. Heavily overmedicated for 3 then in denial for 7. I'm now almost a week into Lamictal and terrified it's going to trigger mania. I've been obsessively recording every dream paranoid thought and mood variance and I feel completely lost. I can't tell if feeling happy is normal or the beginnings of an episode and I'm overthinking until I'm 10 feet deep in depression. Last night I had my first suicidal ideationthoughts of self harm in months. I was on my way home from the store picking up supplies to eat my feelings is this why people gain weight on these meds? And I sobbed the whole way home and sat in my driveway for 10 minutea before I could regain my composure. Total hopelessness. I feel so lost. Have any of you experienced depression from Lamictal? The overanalyzing is killing me and the more I look at it the more lost I feel.,Bipolar
46193,Seroquel side effects I was recently put onto seroquel quetiapine in the UK and about an hour after taking it I have trouble with my balance and my speech becomes slurred. Only for an hour or so but still offputting.Anyone else experienced this?,Bipolar
46283,How do you control impulse buying? I am depressed right now and remember about a lot of things I bought that I don't use anymore. I am afraid that I will spend too much in my next hypomania. I have no one I trust enough to ask them for help with this. Even if had someone I think I would just buy stuff without asking them first. ,Bipolar
46098,Is it possible to go manic while still on meds? I believe I was beginning to get hypomanic and the sleep problems and agitation had started again. I just got back on abilify low dose 5mg after two or three months off...I was wondering if the meds will completely end the manic episode or if it will just be less severe. I definetely dont want to end up manic as I do stupid things but at the same time I honestly miss having that energy and enthusiasm about life. ,Bipolar
46171,What would you do if the one medication that saved your life gave you a debilitating illness? Lamictal is the only thing that has ever helped me. Lamictal saved me. I have been on everything under the sun and I owe my life to lamictal helping me.But it also gave me a recurring disabling fever condition. I get recurring fevers once a month around 101104 degrees they last 2 weeks and my only symptoms are cold sweats chills and really awful flulike aches. This condition leaves me housebound half of my life because its like having the flu constantly. I have done extensive testing for this through a rheumatologist.My periodic fever syndrome started after starting lamictal 3.5 years ago. It started exactly a month in as I titrated up the dose. I am 99.9 sure it's tied to the medication and my rheumatologist thinks that's very likely. I've had 6 attempts of getting off lamictal and I absolutely cant and possibly never will be able to get off of it so I'm stuck. It helps me too much so I end up suicidal lowering my dose. Rheumatologist started treating me for the fever syndrome anyway in case treating the inflammation would help but I've only had a slight reduction in symptoms. Psychiatrist says there's really nothing else for me to switch to with my history of everything I've tried and it's down to either getting off or finding a way to treat my fevers. I take lithium as well but it doesn't help depression like lamictal doesApparently 5 of people who take lamictal have periodic fevers as a symptom and even lamictalinduced lupus is a thing which is terrifying. I don't know where to go from here. ,Bipolar
45412,Abilify My pdoc started me on 10mg of abilify so I took my first dose this morning. How has abilify worked for you? How were the side effects and how did you deal with them? Did you feel better? I know everyone reacts different but I always get very anxious with med changes and like knowing how it went for other people!,Bipolar
45918,Should i ask to be evaluated for spd at my next pdoc appointment? I have an appointment on tuesday. I have reason to believe i have sensory processing disorder. is there any reason to bring it up? will i just be looked at as the annoying self diagnosing patient? I believe my sensory issues are a huge factor in my anxiety especially in leaving the house and social situations. years ago i tried to tell people i thought i might have aspergers but i just got laughed at my fam who sees me as a bit of a hypochondriac. maybe i am,Bipolar
46358,Is this me? off my chest I'm not asking legit medical advice all I'm wondering is some direction in why I am the way I am. and at the same time it's a bit of an off my chest . I've never felt quiet right but I tried to accept it as I never wanted to be categorized as someone who's mentally ill. But lately I notice I'm getting worse and the only way to describe it for me when I found the word 'Manic depression''Bipolar'. It's as if I felt understood for the first time. A lot of my time I spend alone on my room except when I go out to meet friends. So my family doesn't know much of my personality. Last summer I had a job at the same restaurant my sister works and shecoworkers noticed how I'm often staring into space while smiling and this is a big part of me. Whenever I experience this full on power high feeling as described by people during manic depression I get lost in my fantasies and I feel as if the world surrounding me no longer exist and build up whole scenario's and imagine people to be near me. For example I would imagine to be in a big house while holding a conversation with a person I want to speak with and I would laugh at their jokes as if it were their jokes. most of the time my life is amazing in these deep daydreams sometimes they could be described as another persons nightmare. I'm not even hating this. I feel a part of it is a coping mechanism which goes hand in hand with my natural creativity. And I love the force of energy I have during these moments. How I can smile as if I'm drunk just by staring and thinking about all the amazing things i can accomplish. by thinking how charming I am. And then the next second I could cry. I'm not sure if it's how I really feel sad. Or if it's an overload of happiness that makes me sad in the moment. ButI really burst of energy in which I actually do accomplish a lot. I know it's not a healthy me but it's the best version of myself if I want to get things done. I feel as if it isn't totally me but more a phase. But I love who I am during this phase. Because the other part of me is depressed and has no energy. I hate admitting to this part because while I know my life situation sucks and would had likely made anyone insane and as I have experienced horrible things and have anxiety I hate accepting that a big other side of me is useless by depression. As I feel like I'm constantly trying to fight it and these moments of feeling highhappy actually make me feel at times as if I'm on the right track. But now I read more about this subject I feel I'm not winning any battle at all when feeling high on energy is just another extreme on the spectrum. The weirdest thing I have done in these daydreams is travel to another country because I felt like i couldfinancielle it wasnt the greatest choice like it could be amazing. I fell asleep in the airplane and once I woke up i was wondering what I was doing. I don't regret it and still had an okay time for a couple of days but i do notice it isn't normal behaviour and cried one night wishing to be home again. I'm planning to upload soon a cover of me singing on the internet but i'm slightly afraid of the attention among friends I will get as it will likely impact my emotions. I'm not into getting attention as it will bring out either side of me but I never know which one. Sigh will be a rollercoaster. ,Bipolar
45701,Any advice on Lithium? I have been on various medications for the last twentysomething years. My latest combination is Fluoxetine Bupropion Resperidone and some lorazepam for anxiety attacks. I cycled back down into a depression a couple of weeks ago and it got bad enough that I went to see my psych doc. I told her I dont like the resperidone because although it works and stops me wanting to actively kill myself it turns me into a complete zombie. She decided to try me on Litium which is one of the things I have never tried in all these years. So far I have been on it for almost a week so I havent had my blood work done to check the levels yet but I am feeling no difference in mood or level of depression.Im just wondering what others experiences are with Lithium and what it feels like when it is working? I have been off work for days now and I am wondering if I should take some risperidone just because i know it works fast.,Bipolar
45941,Will lamictal help me more than lithium if I mainly struggle with depression not mania? I have been taking lithium for about a year since my last stay at the psych ward and I have not spiraled into depression like that since.But I can't remember the last time I daydreamed the last time I felt like drawing reading playing the piano anything that matters. I'm not alive right now.So I'm thinking lithium is probably destroying me more than helping me because depression is my problem not so much mania. I have experienced a bit of hypomania it was very uncomfortable but I popped Seroquel when it got bad and it passedSo I think I really need to try lamictal. What should I tell my ARNP? All my insurance covers is this pirate lookin dude who barely speaks English so I have to do the talking,Bipolar
45570,I want my family and my boyfriend to learn more about bipolar disorder since Ive been diagnosed with bipolar 2. What are some good books or websites to share with them? Basically everything in the title. I havent been doing great lately and its been taken out on my parents and boyfriend. Have been having more mixed episodes which suck and then Im drained and feel nothing. My parents have been getting not mad but frustrated because they dont understand. I try explaining to my parents but they dont want to hear it sometimes which makes me feel like shit and then my boyfriend doesnt really understand the way I explain things. He isnt as frustrated but I can just tell it affects him and I wish it didnt. ,Bipolar
46202,recommended English speaking doctor psychiatrist? in Tokyo hello...does anyone would recommend an English speaking doctor psychiatrist? in Tokyo preferably around Setagaya ku to do a diagnostic?

46399,Motivation to take medication Hey guys! I'm really struggling to take my medication lately family or friends can't really understand why it's so hard to do and to be honest I'm not really sure. What do you guys do to keep yourself taking it consistently? ,Bipolar
46076,When you finally convince yourself to take medication... ...and you dont drink often so you decide to get all your drinking out beforehand. Then you remember how nice it feels to be tipsy and you start to think maybe you dont need your medication after all.An endless cycle. ,Bipolar
45623,Anyone else have detrimental avoidance issues? For example My gas got turned off. I've been avoiding opening bills because I can't pay them. I didn't realize it had been long enough that it was going to be shut off. If I had I might have been able to prevent it. I find there is a pattern of extreme avoidance in my life. Especially when I'm depressed which is the majority of the time. I have countless examples of things that have been blown out of proportion by my avoidance. I know stuff doesn't just go away but I can't seem to handle anything anymore. Then it snowballs until something like this happens.,Bipolar
46232,Jumped from stairs and sprained my ankle after many weeks of depression i finally got my manic episode today when leaving school i though it would be great idea to jump from this high and long stairs so i would be home sooner. My plan went wrong and i fell straight on the ground. Nothing hurt me at that moment so i went happily home after 30 minutes i noticed my right leg is bigger than my left was pretty funny to me fast forward i ended in hospital with pretty bad sprained ankle and for next month i will need crutches.,Bipolar
45621,Happiness I feel like there's been a lot of posts on here lately about people fearing that happiness or stability will turn into hypomania. This made me think about how much it sucks that people with bipolar have to approach happiness in ways that others don't.For the first time in years a bunch of positive stuff is coming together for me I'm for the moment financially secure my job is challenging but not overwhelming I have the chance to work on a really cool project the weather is nice where I am I've been running again and signed up for a race and after careful tapering I'm down to my lowest daily dose of Klonopin in 9 years. For someone without bipolar it would be obvious that this combination of things would make someone happy and you wouldn't question that this is a great thing! But since I have bipolar I'm already like am I happy or am I too happy?It just seems kinda unfair that we can't just be happy when nice stuff happens to us. People with unipolar depression who begin to feel less depressed have nothing to fear unless their SSRIs make them manic and turn into one of us mwahahaha. People who have anxiety and become less anxiousgreat! People with bipolar who finally reach a balance...nope! Better be on the watch for hypomania!It just seems like we're not allowed to enjoy being happy....,Bipolar
46204,Grieving what my life could have been It's been about a year since I was diagnosed type 2 and my therapist says I'm still in denial that I actually have bipolar disorder. I guess she's right. In a way I guess I'm grieving over what I thought my life could've been stable connected to others and successful. I'm stuck in a mindset where I feel like my symptoms are only in my head and if I stop taking my meds and going to therapy everything will go back to normalno more suicidal thoughtsattempts and hypomania. Yet if roles were reversed and a friend were telling me this I'd tell them to keep taking their meds and going to therapy and move on with their life. I know this is just whining but to be honest I just don't want to have bipolar disorder. I've realized how serious bipolar disorder is and I don't want to deal with the stigma and the risksuncertainty and the work involved. I don't want to keep having to disclose this loved ones. I don't want the decreased lifespan from being likely to commit suicide. I don't want the reckless decisions that come with mania and mixed states. I don't want any of this.Has anyone else experienced these feelings? How do I accept my condition so I can move on with my life?,Bipolar
45724,I just really need to rant about the aspects of bipolar disorder Ive been struggling with the most lately side effects mania moods.. Its been almost a year since I was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder amp my first and only manic episode. I cringe so much when I think about the time I was manic. I know I need to be nice to myself because I literally had no control over it but I just hate the person I was for like a week. I thought I felt empathy for the first time in my life and also thought I could read minds and was super obsessed with eye contact and the subconscious mind. Classic bipolar shit. It hurts to watch shows that depict people having manic episodes. I wish I could just erase that part of my life which I guess I am doing to the best of my ability. Just blocking it out. Didnt happen.But now Im on lithium and lamictal which have thankfully allowed me to at least seem sane to other people but honestly Im lying when I say theyre making me feel all better. Theyre not. Lithium fucking sucks. I have no appetite. Im nauseous 97 of the time and eating makes it worse. I used to have such a beautiful figure but Im getting so fucking skinny my curves are going away. I tried to eat a lot two nights ago because I really want to gain a few pounds but I ended up feeling so nauseous I just cant do that often enough to gain weight back. And the fucking flaking. I feel so disgusting. My skin has never flaked before but my left ear now flakes so much daily. I hate it.And probably the worst of all it feels like my head is no longer mine. I cant trust my thoughts or my feelings. As soon as I start to get passionate about something I start speaking quickly my mind races my hands start shaking and boom Im hypomanic thinking about all the weird shit I thought about during mania making sense of things that dont exist. I cant even fucking explain that to anyone because none of my friends have bipolar disorder and none of them get it. So Im just trying to act normal while my head is just being literally insane. This almost entirely defeats my ability to feel joy about anything literally. If Im not hypomanic Im just stuck in depression. I feel really alone. I miss who I used to be before all this happened.I wish I could just turn it off you know? I cant even selfmedicate with alcohol because if I have more than a few drinks Ill throw up in the morning.Hopefully it gets easier.,Bipolar
45886,Geodon Questions for anyone taking Geodon what dose are you taking? Did you start at that dose or slowly raise? Do you take twice a day?I'm taking 80 now. I'm not sleeping very good and when I wake up I'm so groggy and feel horrible! Can't go to sleep can barely keep eyes open but also wierdly restless. Did anyone have similar experiences when starting? Been taking for 18 days and 3rd day on 80. Couldn't get to sleep until 4am and up at 9am. Just now barely starting to function. thanks!,Bipolar
45881,Quick question should I take my seroquel now or not? My daughter went to sleep really early and I'm afraid she might wake up after I've taken my seroquel already. It takes about an hour to work. I've never tried to stay awake after I've taken it so i don't know what to expect if I did. Would i hallucinate?And if I did skip it tonight is there a chance I could withdrawal tomorrow?Thank you in advance!,Bipolar
45789,creative work and getting way way overly excited? So for years because I haven't been able to do any normal job I've been making creative projects at home as my job. But I've always had extremely huge trouble actually getting creative work done even though I'm never not extremely passionate about my projects even when I'm really depressed.I'm now on Lamictal and have been for a few months and holy f'ing shit it makes such a huge different and I think it's going to save my entire future. One thing I wasn't expecting was that it's given me tons of insight into what feelings and levels of excitement and joy aren't actually normal because I now barely ever get them totally randomly out of the blue except when I was off the meds for a few days and it was... yeah. But obviously they're not 100 gone.So the point of the post is...I'm realizing so much about why putting in the time to create things was always so difficult because pretty much every single time I would then hypomanicish feelings would come up and it would make functioning so difficult. I would usually get so overstimulated I had to stop or I'd keep going but then have a massive crash into depression a few days later if I started working on something at night then instead of sleeping after I'd have to spend hours obsessing over how amazing the thing I'm making is. And I guess I knew this already that this happens but now it's like WOW SO THESE FEELINGS AREN'T NORMAL? NO WONDER THEY INCAPACITATED ME. And because I'm more consciously aware of them I've been trying to practice working on stuff WITHOUT getting sucked down the rabbit hole of having these intense feelings. And even on drugs that help it's fucking difficult. I can do only an hour of being productive and then my mood and energy is just totally different afterwards and it's so exhausting but stopping and trying to relax immediately helps me not spin into something for hours or days that leaves me completely drained. And also it's no fucking wonder that my anxiety around starting a work session never got better after years because it could result in such intense draining awful things.So I'm wondering who here can relate?When I read about bipolar I don't see anything about how the uppyfeelings can be triggered so incredibly easily and consistently by one thing which is why I didn't see things from this perspective before. But now that I don't really get those feelings randomly without reason since being on Lamictal I see how abnormal they are and now recognize that's why other creative people are able to get so much done because working on something creative for over an hour doesn't make life into the most exciting thing ever in the world. But even on pills I still get the feelings pretty much every time when working on anything I'm passionate about. So yeah I dunno hoping people can relate because I don't want to feel so alone and freakish and broken anymore.,Bipolar
45842,Bipolar II and not on meds. I 23F have Biploar II and have never been on meds to treat it. I am not a fan of medications unless there is absolutely no other option besides death. I have tired Prozac once but it made me violently nauseous and did nothing to help me.. For the most part I think I have managed fine so far. .I have waves of very low hopeless depression and then waves of great high functioning hypomania. Anyone else similar to this? opinions?,Bipolar
45737,How do I take the next step to understanding myself? I'm using this account as it's kinda my throw away deep confession account. I'm going through some shit right now which is kinda relate to this but for a while now I've been trying to understand if my 'normal' is really normal or if there's something I need to get checked out by a professional.For as long as I can remember I've struggled to control my emotions in the context of what's around me and most of the time I've been acting accordingly. If I'm at a party and I'm supposed to be having a good time I might still be super upset about the fact that my favorite TV show has ended and what's going to fill that void. I attended my brothers funeral carried the coffin even and I wasn't that upset but people are watching so I tried my hardest to cry and look authentic. Later on of course I was distraught but my emotions were always out of sync with reality. My mood guides everything I do. I'm of pretty normal intelligence I think I went to school am told that I'm pretty logical in my thinking but I just can't seem to do the most basic things. I'll sometime go a couple of weeks without a shower not proud to admit that because when the opportunity presents itself to shower I'll be engrossed in something so deeply that the thought just gets shrugged of until next time upon which is just repeated again. Sometimes that things I'm doing is just sitting down staring into space thinking but it feels like important work. Other times I can't stand my own skin and shower three times a day. There's no normal middle ground!My mood can often change at the drop of a hat too. I immerse myself in work and over extend what I can handle because it keeps my brain from being Moody or reacting to stuff around me but someone will make a benign comment like they're going on holiday and if I get an envious thought in my head it just multiplies into this intense deep deep depression where I sneak out of work and drive somewhere I'm trusted to manage my own time to be alone and sink further and further. The scary thing is I sometimes embrace this mood it's like I need it and it feels comfortable to be sitting in a car crying by myself. I'll carry this mood with me all day usually acting normally in front of the family when I get home and making an excuse to go to bed early because I know that also is the best chance I get to reset. It's not working tonight though as it's 2am and I've taken two tramadol to help sleep.Other times I'm invincible. Right now despite a few big troughs in the last few days where I've been super depressed I'm super super confident. For the first time in my career I've pushed myself and created a new role that is bigger than I ever thought I would get. It's a 'big' job a Director role with a lot of responsibility I'm so proud of myself I take on all these extra responsibilities and I'm totally overloading myself because I know I'm amazing. But I can't tell my family how happy I am because the mania I experience through the day rarely carried through to home. And if I'm not in the mood to be excited then I don't talk about it and my day was 'fine'.I've done reading enough to probably have the wrong idea about what I'm like. I fell like I have some level of bipolar but I don't want to go to my doctor and tell him that in case he just says that I'm normal and this is life pal get used to it. I've never talked to anyone about this other than one close friend who is bipolar and we have similar thoughts.The logical side in me says go to the doctor and explain myself but I fear that the Dr won't be able to keep up with me when I talk. If I'm up then I can't get my words out quickly enough and just babble. If I'm down I'll think about every word and choose them so carefully I'll filter out crucial information because I don't want the Dr to think badly of me.I want to be told that someone else is liked me I want to hear that medication is there to help me I want to stop being up and down all the time so I can focus on sitting out the other problems in my life like normal people do. I really just wanted to write all of this down so I'm sure the post will get buried. ,Bipolar
46001,Side effectsmedicine advice. First I want to be honest as far as I know I am not bipolar. BUT I am epileptic and we take a lot of the same medicine. So I am asking you guys because I cant seem to get any useful advice elsewhere. I take Divalproex 500mg and I feel like complete crap while on it and weak and and tired and depressed most of the time mood swings I dont hardly eat. I also have still have seizure while on this medicine. I wont have health Insurance through work for another 2 months. I dont know whether I should keep taking it or wait till I talk to a neurologist. They cant seem to figure out what the source of my episodes are Ive dont many test. This is my second medicine. The first one Levetiracetam 500mg it didnt seem to help either I was very depressed and suicidal on that one. Im just terrified Im going to keep having episodes. Any advice would help. Stop taking my current medicine and wait or continue and tuff it out. Thanks in advance I really appreciate it,Bipolar
46431,is there any correlation between bipolar 1 and how we perceive fear? I cant play scary games or watch scary movies. I want too and I try too but everytime I do i just get paralyzed by fear and can't move forward or continue watching. It seems so easy for others to enjoy but even though I know it's fake it always seems too real for me. Could there be any connection or am I just a wuss?,Bipolar
46037,Trying to get diagnosed... Also looking for health insurance HiI recently have started on the journey to get some help. And new to this sub. I've been reading but to scared to put myself out there.I don't know if I'm bipolar. I've done a bunch of research and I believe I can trace manic highs and depressed lows as far back as very in early in life... I'm 28 now. The last 4 full swings as I call them took about 4 and a half to 5 years to run their course. They gotten more pronounced as I started adulthood. This last one landed me a 3 month mania build up with full blown mania for about a month I wish I could explain this part better... All I can say is that I was not myself and I was pretty delusional about what I could and couldn't accomplish... Sleeping three or four hours every day or two and trying to do everything and then one of the hardest depressions I've ever experienced for roughly four or five months suicidal thoughts complete isolation from everyone and everything including work weight gain of about 70 pounds increased self loathing.I'm also a complete fuck up in life. So maybe that's a consideration. This last time the catalyst for my swing was believing I could do a new job and then eventually hiding from it because I couldn't carry some of the tasks out due to anxiety.I guess I wanted to give out some info since I see a lot of you guys share yourselves openly... And maybe vent too.So two days ago was tough. And I've been thinking and thinking about trying to get help but the farthest I've gotten is two therapy sessions with someone I really didn't hit it off with. So after having a shitty wave of self hatred that day I decided to call around again. I found a practice with a therapist and psychiatrist. I went through the process of setting up an appointment to first see the therapist and then the psychiatrist.I don't have health insurance. It's a steep bill but I can pay it. As a side note before I tried the new job I landed myself a decent paying job that is also self employed so I can take days or even weeks off without too many reprocussions. I've done that going on 6 years. It's very difficult to explain but I developed a skill at this job and I could do it the rest of my life if I wanted. But because it is set up the way it is it doesn't give me health insurance retirement or any benefits you might find at other jobs.I figured if I was going to shell out a wad of cash to self pay for trying to get help and ongoing therapy if it's recommended I should look at just self paying for insurance.I just don't know where to start so I don't get health insurance sales calls. I didn't even know those existed. I was called almost 20 times in 68 hours. Fuck maybe more. And I was trying to work.I don't want to risk ANOTHER set of health insurance salespeople having my information. I just found my state's marketplace? Seems more legit than the 2nd AD on Google.Does anyone have experience or a better starting place? I asked a family member but no one is in this particular situation. And I don't even understand how health insurance works really.I'm in my kinda of even place in the episodes. Truth be told if I hadn't had an exceptionally hard day two days ago and talk to someone about it briefly I probably wouldn't be asking for help. I never really ask for help. But I feel the shit building up against my demons again and I'm so afraid of another swing.I just want of this train. I need a change.,Bipolar

45481,Reputable online screening I really think I have bipolarity I really don't want anyone else to know especially family and was wondering if you all could recommend a reliable reputable online test for it. I just want to have a more firm comprehension of what I feel. Thanks in advance!,Bipolar
45436,Spiritual feelings I always seem to get a feeling that I am part of some kind of energy that runs through the universe either during a phsycotic episode or just after. Has happened all three times the same feeling. It feels really intense and I get some kind of idea that I should be doing something about it nonviolent always makes me feel connected to nature and really compassionate. I feel like I am important and protected by it. Then the stage passes and I almost completely forget about it.Does anyone else get the same? Not similar but the exact same? I wouldn't want to use meds to suppress this if we are just waking up.,Bipolar
45786,Polyamory Hope everyone is doing well. Was wondering if any of you have tried a polyamorous lifestyle and if so what your experiences were. I've always wanted to but haven't ever jumped in. I've come far in learning how to live with BP II and am considering starting to pursue romance poly style. ,Bipolar
46194,Disgust with partner during depressive episode We all know the pattern infatuation with new s.o. Then a few months later when depression kicks in they become the most annoying disgusting person. I'm aware it's the illness and it will pass but once those thoughts are formed the magic of the relationship is gone and I'm back to believing that I'm better off alone. It's too much work to push through the depressive period trying to make myself feel better and get out of the mood but also to convince my partner that it's all ok and I still like them. I simply want to be alone when I am depressed and it's annoying and a huge turn off to have to validate a partner when I am fighting tooth and nail not to jump off a bridge from the depression. Please talk some sense into me or tell me how you cope when this happens! ,Bipolar
46133,My boss made a joke about bipolar disorder rant I haven't and won't be disclosing my diagnosis at work. Yesterday my boss was talking about someone outside of our company and how volatile that person's demeanor is and how he must be bipolar or something.Just a bummer... I always feel like bipolar is a deep dark secret that no one can find out. I work in a professional field where intelligence and ability to work under pressure are critical. Perceived instability would almost certainly prevent me from advancing. It's stressful to always be pretending not to be struggling. I know a lot of others are in the same boat.I would love to say I don't need this job or I could go somewhere else but the stigma is real and I'm almost positive this would be an issue anywhere...,Bipolar
46228,Vitamin D and B12 Deficiency Sorry about lack of clarity Im not exactly sure how to phrase this because Im confused myself and I am on mobile.I sought out treatment after I was having some pretty concerning suicidal thoughts the past year.I reached out the a therapist at my University and immediately was referred to a psychiatrist under the guise of maybe benefitting from mood stabilizers.Before my psychiatry appointment I researched into mood stabilizers and saw they were used in treating bipolar. Read up on bipolar and really identified understood why she would recommend me to the psychiatrist assuming she thought I could have bipolar. Met with the psychiatrist and not to my surprise she said she was sure I was bipolar. However she wanted me to get bloodwork before starting me on lithium to see my levels in various things. She said she was going to diagnose me official with unspecified mood disorder until she saw my results regarding my thyroid. I was pretty bummed hearing this news she essentially told me I had bipolar disorder but lacked whether it was I or II so I still felt lost but like I was on the right track.Well my blood work came back and everything was normal except I had extremely low vitamin D and B12. My psychiatrist called me and gave me dosage for otc vitamins. I read into the situation wrong and assumed she was just reducing my issues down to deficiencies.I know these two deficiencies do not explain mania. Maybe vitamin D explains psychosis but I dont experience this. I felt like everyone was so sure I was bipolar and led me on to thinking I had a solution and I think this issue runs deeper than just supplements.I know many mental illnesses have links to vitamin deficiencies and I guess my confusion comes from whether or not anyone else experienced this along with being bipolar. I have an appointment on Thursday first one since bloodwork and was wondering if I should mention the bipolar diagnosis if she doesnt.TLDR is my doctor reducing her diagnosis to needing vitamin d and b12? Can this and bipolar coincide? ,Bipolar
45619,Weird behavior I've been sleeping at weird hours have not left the apartment or done any work in days and days and am obsessively fantasizing about having someone come save me.

45753,Inarticulate Do you ever feel like no matter what you do or say no one will ever really understand what youre talking about? Its lonely. I used to think its the bipolar but maybe its just me that doesnt make sense. I know theres good things about being creative. But the reverse of it is I dont choose to see things in a different way I cant see them like everyone else. It makes me feel stupid or rather like I have the wrong operating software and people can tell but they cant fix it. I feel like Im good for 1 in 100 things. Because if you want it done the normal way Ill probably do it wrong. This is boring and self pitying but I just have no one to tell.,Bipolar

45785,How seriously do I take BP break up in noncommunicative phase? SO A is BP2 rapid cycling or maybe not. Dx is up in the air but has been treating for that for 10 years. A is also currently treating for PTSD and has a bad case of seasonal affective disorder. One month ago everything was fine. We were engaged no issues planning to leave the state and this bad climatelatitude in the spring. Then overnight there was a sudden withdrawal of communication. This usually resolves in a few days. It didn't. A week ago A told parents that we were moving together we are LGBT this was a big step. Then I had a bad week and needed communication and it wasn't happening. I admit I called and texted more than I should have but I've been supportive through MULTIPLE issues and haven't asked for a lot back. A responds that she wants to move to another state on the other side of the country not where I can readily work but one state I can't really work in. Wants to stay friends. Which is not really possible right now when all of my plans are being yanked out from under me. I don't know how seriously to take this. A claims to lose hisher mind here because of the winter every February. This one arrived right on schedule. Says is tired of being medicalized but A doesn't work and is probably disabled because of multiple medical issues which I have been doing my best to help with. Won't leave the house for more than a few hours. A says will think about it for a couple of weeks rather than ending things right this minute. I don't think she means it right now. Meaning I dont think theres any real intent to stay with me.I'm being intentionally vague because I don't want any possible invasion of hisher privacy. But I'm tired and I admit I'm having invasive thoughts of my own. Fellow BP travelers how do I evaluate how serious this is? Should I assume I'm being discarded for no reason at all? What do I do? ,Bipolar

45946,Extremely anxious about helping a friend next week I havent really seen any of my friends in about two years due to severe depression mental breakdowns and moving and all that stuff. A friend of mine had a baby not too long ago and asked if I could help her with something all day in about a weeks time. I know its really important that she get help for this and I thought it over and said that I would. I DO NOT want to cancel. I want to be a good reliable friend which I havent been in the past due to...well...bipolar and anxiety disorders. Im anxious about getting sick about being around people for 7 hours about doing something that requires me to talk to people about having IBS in a public area. Im going to take Imodium Ill bring Xanax and other meds with me and Ill steal away to the bathroom if I need to. I know logically that everything will be fine.

46072,Reflecting on bipolar and relationships Hi everyone.I recently started dating someone who was diagnosed BP I and is medicated. I'm new to this sub so instead of asking something that has already been asked I searched through some of the older posts about BP and romantic relationships. Some of them are uplifting and others are absolutely heartbreaking. What I read has given me a somewhat clearer perspective but it could always be better.I have been around bipolar most of my existenceone of my very best friends has been in my life for 25 years and is BP II. I recognize the difference between the two that BP affects different people differently and that all relationships have some common facets regardless of their nature.But I am curious. Is there anything you wish you would have known going into a friendship or romantic relationship? Anything you wish your friend or partner would have known? I'm lookong for perspectives from either side of the coin. I want to understand more thoroughly so I can be a better partner and friend.Thanks for reading. ,Bipolar

46040,In high school I was in a manic episode for 2 years In high school I was in a manic episode. In sophomore year during the hypomanic phase I started talking about sex a lot and got in trouble. Two months into my junior year the mania started. I thought I was going to win the lottery and become the president the next MLK or really famous. I even intentionally failed classes because I thought I was going to become the president anyway. I thought everyone in America was going to change the constitution for me while I gave a speech in front of a big audience like MLK did in the civil rights march. I thought I had a special connection to god and god put me here for a special purpose.When I spoke I switched from one topic to another easily. I was very hyper had lots of energy was easily distracted and always wanted to chat. One time when I entered school the security guard once said this one is always laughing and smiling. I went with my mom to buy lottery tickets they don't sell tickets to minors. I thought I was going to win the lottery and use the money to make myself famous. I used to go to an organization with lots of little offices and I had a plan to buy the building and employ people there to promote my agenda. One time a fortune teller solicited me on the street. I went in and I asked her what college I am going to go to. She answered Harvard. I literally thought I was going to Harvard. I didn't tell my parents most of my plans because I thought they would interfere with them. I was very angry and moody at home.A few days before I turned 18 there was a breaking point I realized all the stuff I believed weren't true. I was devastated. I wasn't going to become the president or the next MLK. I failed many class. I couldn't sleep at night. I was extremely stressed out. I managed to catch up on my work took summer school and thankfully graduated in the summer on time. A year later I decided to google bipolar and I read the symptoms of a manic episode on WebMD.As I read more about bipolar I learned it's impossible for bipolar I to go undiagnosed. So I wondered how this went on for 2 years without me being diagnosed? During sophomore year CPS was called because I was talking about sex. Then at the end of sophomore year I did the most stupidest thing. I drew 911 on a state test. This was a math question about storage bins so I made bin laden jokes. I was laughing but the school wasn't and they took me to a hospital. The hospital just let me go and told me not to do this again. The security pointed out a couple of times I was always laughing and smiling. I saw counselors at school who are mental health professionals. I wondered if this will happen again but I don't think it will. Well if there's anything worse than bipolar it's severe OCD. I am taking medication for that now. Severe OCD is HELL.I most certainly embarrassed myself. In 9th grade I told my classmates I wanted to become a prostitute. I was annoying during my high school years. I didn't think there was anything wrong with me. I thought there was something wrong with everybody else. I guess I am lucky this happened in high school where you are still supported by your parents and not in adulthood where you quit your job and become homeless. Online I realized was safer than offline. When I posted online I used a pseudonym and never used my identity. So if I said I wanted to become a prostitute or something embarrassing online it would not affect my reputation. But if I say I want to become a prostitute to my friends they'll remember it and it will affect your reputation. I actually had former classmates come up to me and say remember when you said you wanted to become a prostitute. I mean I am most definitely not the person I was in HS.We had a teacher with a reputation for being mean and a girl at my school said she's bipolar because one minute she's happy and the next minute she's angry. I literally thought that was the teacher's diagnosis but I didn't know what bipolar was or that I had it. Now I know what bipolar is and realize the girl was using the term colloquially. While I know what bipolar really is my classmates still probably don't know.,Bipolar
46333,Treatment for bipolar depression Ive been diagnosed with bipolar. I struggle with psychosis primarily in the form of delusions. They tell me this is mania even though i dont experience the typical symptoms like endless energy. Well ive been put on a latuda an antipsychotic and depercote to combat the delusions. My problem is im horridly depressed now. I spoke to my doctor about what we can do for depression and he said whatever treatment we pick its going to be a long time till it works. My question is what treatments have been effective for managing your bipolar depression? This is a long battle thats starting to feel unsurmountable. Any input would be greatly appreciated. ,Bipolar
46138,Misdiagnosed? So I was recently diagnosed with bipolar however I am really debating it the last few hours. I have felt fine for a few days really really good Ive done a lot sorted lots out and now I am kinda feeling like its over the top saying its bipolar and I am actually fine. I am really confused about everything. Is this the bipolar in me messing with me or am I actually fine?

45960,New BP1 I was recently admitted for a short involuntary stay at the county hospital psychiatric ward. My so took me because I had a breakdown last Monday amp cut myself and was threatening suicide and really wanted it. I was so scared and angry with my so for forcing me to go. I was screaming and crying. The hospital itself was dirty and it was overcrowded. I slept for 12 hours and then woke up to be told I was being admitted to my surprise because despite my arm being cut up I felt okay and wanted to go home. The unit I was taken to was the only available one and it was a schizophrenic unit. Wow the things i saw and experienced were remarkable. I left with a bipolar 1 diagnosis and it makes a lot of sense to me and am started on Latuda for about a week now and dont feel any different. Cut again on Monday. Hoping for a break in this depression. ?,Bipolar

46063,Sick and tired of being sick and tired. Haven't posted in a while but.... Here goes. Quick background BP1 Lamictal Welbutrin Benztropine Hydroxyzine.So I have a appointment with my pdoc this afternoon.... and I really feel like I need a med change of some sort. Long story sort I went inpatient last year around July for a full blown psychotic manic episode after taking SSRIs for months and not realizing they were in fact driving me bat shit crazy. They kept me in the hospital for 16 days on a CEC which I think I'd the max without a court order. I went home slightly less delusional than when I went in still not well by any means. This subsided as time passed and with med compliance. As I came down I was in a mixed state for a while and eventually wound up crashing into what I was hoping was only a depressed episode the only thing is that I have not come out of it for almost a year now. Furthermore at this point it doesn't feel like my depressive lows of the past. I feel more detached from life than ever and I am constantly obsessively plagued by the thought that somehow I will stumble upon some kind of joy that I once understood. I have lost any and all drive that I once had..... Personal Improvement Professional Advancement Sexual Intamacy Intamacy of any kind for that matter it has all been lost somewhere in the past. It feels like when you misplace your keys and need to get out of the house quickly because you are already running behind for an important event. Every minute that passes while you look for the keys you know you are falling further and further behind and then you start to regret not making an intentional effort to put them where they could be found after you last used them.... but as they say hindsight is 2020. Finally you look up and realize that even if you did find you keys at this point that you likely wouldn't make it until after the events concludes anyway so what's the point in stressing over it now worry about it tomorrow...... Rinse and Repeat. My life has become a series of repetitive movements each step trying to make it to the next hoping it will be easier but it's not. Each night trying to fall asleep and telling myself that I will wake up rested an refreshed to take on the day but I won't. I don't want sympathy I don't want attention I just want to feel better I truly just want to be well. Whatever the hell that means.,Bipolar
45965,Bipolar 1 side effects Went to the doctor for tendonitis and brought up to the second doctor of the day about me being Bipolar 1 and he was the first doctor in over 6 years to bring up Hyper Sexuality as a side effect. ?? I amwell aware of that and that's partly why I ended up moving away from Branson MO area and deleted dating apps after meeting my serious bf. I said I didn't want to end up pregnant and he was worrying about me getting diseases. I was like oh yeah that's important too to avoid those lol ?? it cracked me up but it was awesome that he knew to bring that up without me bringing it up. He sounded very aware of the impulsiveness and crazy boosts of energy I experience. I also got asked when my last mania episode was right now is not a good answer but the truth. I'm trying to suppress the urge to go spend all my money and I can't go run because of the tendonitis in my left foot. I've been hyper for days but I'm trying to be okay.

46094,I'm depressed Friend of mine who I valued a lot just cut all ties with me. Told me that Im too needy and emotional. Theyre not wrong. Im bipolar and I had a really fucked up childhood which caused a lot of abandonment issues something Im in therapy for now. It does make me very emotional at times and I do tend to be super clingy during depressive episodes. Lately Ive been rapid cycling which causes me to have more of them. They knew all this and I was hoping they would understand. But they told me that they dont want anything to do with me and never want to see me or talk to me again. Feels weird. Just this Monday my therapist told me that my fear of abandonment is just that a fear and I need to overcome it. Told me that I need to open new pathways in my brain and know that people wont leave me. This doesnt help with that at all.I started a new job this week and its mind numbingly boring and insanely hard. Im only on week one and I already hate it. Im dreading going to work today. But I need this job. It pays well and I have a decent amount of debt that I need to pay back.Because of my childhood I dont feel like I can ever trust my parents. Im not close to any of my family. After having so many friends walk out on me over the years I feel like I cant trust the friends who did stick with me. I feel like things just need to get a bit harder and theyll leave too.I havehad dreams about doing something in the entertainment field. But lately I dont feel any drive or motivation to chase after that. I dont see the point in it. I wanted fame and money because I thought I could give the people I love awesome things with it. But I dont really love anyone anymore. Im always paranoid and worried that everyone will leave me.I just feel so alone all the time. I feel like no one really understands me. I feel like I cant connect. Even with my therapist I cant really tell her how I feel. Because sometimes my thoughts are really fucked up and when I tell people they freak out on me. Medication doesnt help. I just hate waking up in the morning now. The only times I ever feel ok is when I drink or take something. I just really hate life right now. I wish there was a permanent way to just numb everything.,Bipolar

46167,Overreacted and feeling guilty I completely overreacted over something so minor and I ended up getting really upset and saying to my boyfriend I wanted to die. I do not want to die but I wanted that moment to end. I also said nobody cared for me which isnt true because he does. Most of all I feel embarrassed and majorly guilty for saying saying I wanted to die. I dont know why I did that and I wish I could rewind time. He has been my absolute rock and I am just throwing it all back in his face without meaning to. Its like I cant stop myself from saying horrible things andor reacting so badly towards nearly everything. I dont think we will talk about this again but I just feel so awful for saying I wanted to die. After everything he does to make sure I am well and okay. I feel so guilty and I can see so clearly it was a total overreaction once again. He knows the cycle of the bad days mad sad and guilty. He knows how my day is going to be before I do. I just cant believe Im acting like this towards the man I am so in love with. Its been a bad couple of days after a handful of good ones.,Bipolar
45460,Low grade hypomania is back...and I love it Before my GP put me on antidepressants and spiraled me into a year long crazy cycling that had me re diagnosed to BP I my mania was a manageable predictable state that had me making lists of frugality cleaning like crazy working out and eating healthy. I enjoyed the time and the depression that followed was usually lowgrade as wellgeneral irritability and annoyance of friends feeling like I no longer loved my boyfriend which in stability I found out I don'tOver that last few months I have finally become stable. Until recently. My medicine has been spotty and once I felt the mania coming I stopped taking it at all.Back on meds but still manic. I love the feeling. It isn't the crazy god is speaking to staying up all night redesigning a fish tank why? or hyper reorganizing that left my house a total disaster as I couldn't have the focus to follow through.It's back to setting goals making lists focusing on healthy and happiness. Lowgrade mania actually makes me SAVE moneyI become obsessed with spending as little as I can whereas the mania from antidepressants had me blow 20k over 4 monthsI feel like I'm enjoying living again. Stability is so... so boring. And the problem with stability is that I never learned selfdiscipline in the face of not having manic inspirations. It isn't depression but my room becomes a complete mess I don't take my dogs on walks I don't try at work. Again that's simply because I am so USED to feeling inspiration and energy from mania that stability requires discipline and vigilance that I have never had to learn.So why should I go back on meds? To me this is worth the depression. I become ultrafunctional. Functional enough that I can ride out the depressions as people become used to and aware of my energy and motivation. I understand the mania from before the mania that had me re diagnosed as Bipolar Ithat was purely induced from meds is unsustainable. I didn't even enjoy it. But this is something altogether different. It is ME. I don't know 'stability' that is not me. I don't even dislike it as I'm going through it but now that I'm experiencing the energy again I don't think I can go back. How am I supposed to write poetry paint play the piano clean focus on my healthyhow am I supposed to do that stable when I have no knowledge of selfdiscipline that makes you drudge through you chores while you're tired and uninspired.I almost feel bad for 'stable' peopleto never experience the inspiration that we have. On the other hand comparing stability to this makes it a nobrainer that this is better. Even the depression was apart of me before. Stability is a whole different person someone that I don't particularly like.,Bipolar

45564,Looking for opinions on my guide for bipolar spousesfamilypartners httpspsyche.mediathequestionsmostfrequentlyaskedbybipolarsosSo this guide has been up for awhile on the rbipolarSOs subreddit. I decided to write it up the reason being back when my second bipolar partner went manic I found myself caught between the devil and the deep blue sea and struggled to find a lot of helpful information quickly. So I compiled a list of frequently asked questions on rbipolarSOs and answered them all along with including a list of other resources to get help. Feedback from the rbipolarSOs community has been largely positive and I've asked a few people who actually have bipolar disorder in my life and they say they like it as well. Apologies for a few typos and formatting errors. Please let me know what y'all think I'd love to know the perspective from this side of the community.,Bipolar
46066,Marijuana and bipolar Hello Ive scrolled for quite awhile and havent found a recent or pinned post about this discussion. I have seen mixed reviewsexperiences about using cannabis while diagnosed with bipolar. Specifically bipolar IIIm wondering from people in green states or places marijuana is medicinallegal if you are able to stay stable with cannabis medication. Is that even a thing? Ive talked with my psychiatrist about recreational drugs. Im just wondering from other people if marijuana helps you. You cant be taking anything elseThank you,Bipolar
45927,Lamictal Vaginal Issues please be kind Ladies on Lamictal any issues with itching burning yeast or vaginitis? Label identifies vaginitis as a reported side effect though I bet prevalence is unreported due to embarrassment. I am 33 and have never had a single issue down there my whole life totally bumming me out. ,Bipolar
45926,Medical marijuana does it help or hurt? I have a few diagnosed mental health conditions. I was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety as a child and cyclothymia as an adult. My current therapist sees BPD traits too.I changed psychiatric care providers and during my intake appointment the APRN suggested medical marijuana. They told me it would increase the efficacy of the stimulant and mood stabilizer I am on. They also claimed they would be able to replace the benzos I dislike taking.My childhood was absolutely difficult but I don't really see how it would result in PTSD the only psychiatric condition that medical marijuana is approved for in my state I am looking for studies and information about the use of medical marijuana in combination with traditional psychiatric care and therapy. Is there any validity to the claims it will help boost my medication? I am quite interested in CBD for anxiety. I have used marijuana in the past recreationally and of course I like it. Just this fact makes me feel like a big phony. I'm concerned but mostly because I can't find much research on it. Any help is appreciated. ,Bipolar
45560,How many of you have an eating disorder? I go through periods of binge eating and then starving..I don't know how to stop it. I'm a healthy weight but I don't want to keep doing this.

46439,Does anyone feel like they get way too overly attached to their partnersomeone theyre seeing? I handle break ups and unexpected rejection really badly.When I broke up with my ex last year I didnt really care and then 3 months after i was crying for like 2 months about it.I stayed over for one night with someone whod had a crush on me for 3 years the next morning she says she doesnt feel the same way anymore and we should probably never meet again.This past weekend I had a girl Id been video chatting for a while take a 4 hour train ride and stay over for the weekend. It was amazing having her there but it was constantly on my mind that soon she wouldnt be there anymore. I feel like my feelings come way too fast and abnormally and its really making me depressed. Was diagnosed with bp2 a couple of weeks ago and waiting to start meds.,Bipolar
45599,Jumping up and down during mania I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. During my manic episodes when I get excited I start jumping up and down and I usually put my headphones on to intensify my mania. I've been doing this since I can remember and it's taking its toll on my knees. I'm currently taking meds for my disorder but they're not stopping my jumping up and down. Does anyone have a similar issue? How dodid you stopcontrol it?,Bipolar

45437,I am an idiot oh math Xpost from rbipolar I will run out of lithium good on my other prescriptions in less than a week and my pdoc appointment isn't till the 22nd. The only 2 pdocs I've seen and might let me pick up a prescription appointment slots mean waiting for months are closed until the 15th for holidays.This happened last month too and I can't believe I didn't just sit down and do the math in the dr's office so I could insist on a bigger prescription. I'm honestly a little baffled by the pdoc as well.So do I just divide them as evenly as possible and hope things work out or walk to the psych ward I was in for a month in the spring and see if they can give me a scrip? Yech.,Bipolar
45695,Weighted blanket I posted this in the anxiety and insomnia subreddit but I thought Id ask here. Anyone tried a weighted blanket to help with sleep or anxiety? Did it work?,Bipolar
46056,Here we go again EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in 2016. It was BRUTAL but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up and after an assessment it appears that Im in need of a tune up as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... Im starting it again today. I hope that itll be a little less sucky since Ive put some hard work into it previously and that itll be shortlived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. Im still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything? PS For the record Im not trying to scare anyone who is facing the possibility of going through this process. Doing EMDR has changed my life for the better. Ive had PTSD as long as I can remember and the relief that its brought me has been amazing. Just stick it out until it gets better. ,Bipolar
46272,Why does Seroquil sometimes cause hallucinations when it is also meant to suppress them? Just increased dose and I'm starting to get auditory and slight visual hallucinations. I don't have schizophrenia though I take 300mg seroquel and 200mg lamotragine for bipolar II. It's not that bad though the worst side effect I get is congested sinuses and the odd dizzy spell. It does seem to work well for what it's supposed to do otherwise. Anyone else experience these?,Bipolar
46308,Anyone else have no social life whatsoever? Makes me feel like Im cursed even further. Waking up on a Saturday knowing youll just be sitting on your couch like the last 50 weekends slowly but surely makes you begging for death. I didnt ask for this fucking life its unbelievable...Ive got social anxiety and horrible confidence to go with this shitty illness which is just a death sentence ,Bipolar
45547,Been Diagnosed for about three months now and had a few questions... Hi I had a recent diagnosis of BipolarManic Depressive disorder after an episode of psychosis in the summer time.I am just a little confused on my diagnosis. You see I've been super depressed for a really long time and aside from last year I became manic and then had psychosis I haven't really had any uphigh feelings of mood aside from again the one last year. My Psychiatrist said he's 75 certain that I have bipolar so I'll take his word for it but I'm just a little confused.So I guess my questions are Is it common to have the majority of your mood with bipolar be depression? Is it common to have long periods of depression with bipolar and short infrequent bouts of mania? When is it common to start exhibiting signs that your bipolar when you haven't been diagnosed at a young age?Sorry if the questions are kind of stupid I just want to start some conversations about my new found mental illness and learn some things. Thanks friends.,Bipolar
45811,Trump and general rhetoric around the mentally ill is turning me into a paranoid... well... crazy person People talking aboit bring back the age of involuntary long term commitment and how dangerous we all are is driving me nuts. I know that it's unlikely Republicans would ever get around to actually doing anything because it would require a shit ton of money to bring back asylums but it's just making the stigma so much worse. I'm in training to become a teacher and I'm terrified of the day they decide people with bipolar disorder aren't safe around kids. Anyone else feeling the stigma especially bad right now? What are you doing to try to stay calm and carry on?,Bipolar
46184,Bipolar and different perspectives? Hi everyone. Ive been a lurker for a long time. Ive tried to read through the subreddit and the internet to find other stories that relate to me but I cant seem to find it. So here it goes!Background Im a 20 year old male college student diagnosed with MDD in Feb 2017 which transformed to a Bipolar2 diagnosis in Nov 2017. Ive been on Lithium and Wellbutrin adjusting dosages according to my psychiatrist. However things got rough ever since October since my insurance ran out so I havent been taking a steady dose of Lithium since dw my insurance is now reinstated and I cant wait to be stable wooo!Sorry had to get that aside. So sometimes when I notice myself being either depressed hypomania or in a mixed state I cant help but doubt my perspective on life. Sometimes my views on religion family selfworth body positivity and other thoughts change so frequently that I cant tell if its my bipolar influencing my thoughts or if Im experiencing life changes.Ive been doubting and question my religion islam btw sometimes feeling so distant. And then all of a sudden Ill enjoy praying and I feel so connected to God. Imagine a twist on a perspective like this but also to weed alcohol body image etc. Thats been happening quite a bit.A question for you all have you guys ever questioned your perspective on life and doubt it being an effect of Bipolar? Sometimes I dont know if this is who I am NOW or if itll change in a few daysweeks. It really makes it hard for me to be grounded in my beliefs and have a steady outlook on life. I always think my values on life are changing because Im growing as an individual but what if its Bipolar? I would really appreciate it if I could hear any similar stories updates or comments where anyone could relate to this feeling. Sometimes I feel so lost because Im sick of analyzing my thoughts and feelings 247 and comparing it to my previous feelings x days or weeks ago and finally trying to see where and who I am today.TLDR Bipolar 2 20 year old college guy trying to figure out if these different perspectives on life Im having are due to bipolar or are natural? How do you distinguish whats grounded and whats bound to change?,Bipolar
45485,finally got up the courage to go to the Psychiatrist. I'd been hesitant.. scared.. wary.. about going before. Thoughts racing through my head of what a diagnosis would mean for me. My pdoc didn't feel comfortable giving me a diagnosis for anything other than general anxietydepression and recommended I go to a specialist so I could get more accurate treatment. Took me well over a year to finally go. I'd made appointments and blew them off never actually going. I'm so glad I did now.I had to get over the fact that I would get diagnosed with 'something' and it would be on my medical records. I guess I had some preconceived notion that it would never go away and there would be some sort of stigma attached to me everywhere I go. Irrational as that may sound it is what prevented me from seeking professional help.I finally went this past Monday spent an hour with a P.A. talking about my history what meds I am currently on LexaproWellbutrin from my pdoc etc. She took that information and talked to one of their head Psychiatrists about it then came back about 15 minutes later with him. He was very nice understanding and seemed genuinely interested and concerned about my care. My personal research proved to be right. I have Bipolar II. I felt an inner sense of calmness and clarity now that I had a professional someone that has spent their life studying conditions such as this verifying that yes indeed there was something amiss in my brain. And that better help was coming.Lexapro had been working WONDERS for my anxiety and slightly for depression as well. Wellbutrin didn't seem to do much but made life liveable. I was not thriving or excited about anything. Just going through the motions.He took me off Wellbutrin and replaced it with a mood stabilizer Trileptal. I stopped the Wellbutrin cold turkey and started Trileptal that same night. I had a really good Tuesday and today is looking great as well. I feel much better now that I was finally able to get over myself and get proper help and hopefully better meds to balance my moods. I have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. By then I hope to see even more positive changes with the Trileptal.I also chose to stop drinking cold turkey as well. I knew I had been drinking too much for too long. Each time I drank it was 6 beers and sometimes 45 nights a week. It became routine. A way to quell my mind at the end of the night. To slow the racing thoughts. It took the words from the Psychiatrist to really cement it in my brain that alcohol counteracts anti depressants and that in order to feel better I would need to make a lifestyle change. He said the Trileptal would assist in those nighttime racing thoughts.I even stopped smoking cannabis. This happened after I started the Wellbutrin. I think that can be attributed to the fact that Wellbutrin is somewhat of a cessation tool used for people quitting cigarettes. The urge or desire to smoke which used to be daily just stopped. I don't care anymore. It doesn't really do anything for me. Even with my MMJ card and specific strains all it really did was numb me and slow my brain down again like with Alcohol to slow the racing thoughts. So without the alcohol and cannabis I feel strongly that I can finally let my mind be a blank slate for the psych meds to work properly and not be counteracted or made less effective by other psychoactive chemicals.I am committed to feeling better and if drinking La Croix instead of beer helps in any way I'm all for it. I want to be able to let the meds do their job in the most effective manner.Thanks for being here community. I may not post much but do lurk frequently and have gleaned a ton of helpful insights over time since I have been subbed.I hope you all have a wonderful day!,Bipolar
45898,Not sure what this is. I have these kind of episodes where my mind suddenly brings up dark memories and emotions. I'm overwhelmed by them and my mind interprets my surroundings based on the feelings and memories I'm experiencing. I'm aware of my surroundings and I don't zone out but the thoughts become overwhelming and I can't get them out of my head. It's not a flashback. I don't know what it is.,Bipolar
46295,Lithium and muscle pain? Hi allI started lithium about ten days ago with 300 mg at evening. Then as ordered increased it to 300 mg at morning and 300 at evening bringing it to total of 600 mg. I increased the dose yesterday.Since yesterday I have had a quite bad muscle pain in my lower back. It is seriously distracting and affects my daily function. I feel drained in other muscles but the pain is bad.As far as I know I shouldn't even be in the therapeutic range yet. I have blood tests scheluded for 2 weeks from now on but I think I can't handle this.Is it normal to have this amount of pain so early?,Bipolar

46436,I'm in love for the first time since diagnosis and it does not feel good. Yesterday I've put my best friend on a hold. Totally my fault. She were there for me the whole time but things worked out in a way that I developed a crush on her. I really thought wtf mania. Again?. But I had my lithium tests talked to my psychiatrist and sadly I wasn't manic at all. I was really suffering because she has her problems too and when I try to talk with her about it she doesn't respond well. I tried do keep my distance try to get over it but she likes me a lot and we became even closer. Relationships are a huge problem for me and my friend is in a different phase of life. She broke with her first boyfriend recently they were together from age 13 till 18 church boyfriend holding hands only she was unhappy and now she is dating a lot of guys no strings attached a lot like what I do but it hurts for me to see it. I started avoiding being at the same places she goes to and the others close to me are telling me she is not really all that. So I decided to put our friendship on a hold too since I'm unhappy with this let's speed date everyone we can and maybe we'll get together at the end. I can't keep having sex and making out with strangers to compensate her actions you know? It became toxic. Yesterday we've had a huge fight about it because I told her I didn't like to be exposed this way. Edit 1 She thought I called her a whore idk but things went ugly and she told me that I was the one she liked. It doesn't matter because it was turning my first time being ok with my disorder in making me feel like a mess. Sorry if the text is unclear writing in english is uncomfortable for me and sometimes I just can't organize my ideas. ,Bipolar
46258,Symptoms for bipolar disorder? Hello allI'm 18 years old and I'm new to Reddit. When I was ten years old I began to have depression. It wasn't severe but I would often isolate myself from others and think about dying. Over time my depression has gotten worse. However at age 12 I began to have severe mood swings. Sometimes I would get very angry at everybody and everything around me for no reason. Sometimes it would last for a few days and then I would go back to feeling stable or depressed. At age 15 I began to have three distinct and intense emotions that have taken over my life until this point. I rarely felt stable at that point. This feeling can occur for a week or less I feel veryyyyyyy euphoric. I actually love life and everything around me. I feel very energetic and hyper like a five year old. I'm bouncing off the walls and talk very fast because my thoughts race. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because my thoughts would never shut up. However I have never done anything impulsive. I'm mostly abnormally energetic and euphoric. Then I can switch to a depressive episode. These are always the longest they can last for 46 months. At that moment I'm extremely suicidal. I've never tried to commit suicide because I'm scared of failing but the craving is always there. I'm also hopeless think that everybody hates me and I feel so dead and emotionally tired. I sleep for 89 hours and I still feel tired. I can have a good day and still feel extremely miserable even though I know I shouldn't. Then after my depressive episode I can feel super angry and annoyed at everything and everybody for no reason. I just get super angry and lash out at anybody and I don't know why. This lasts for a week or less. I have been to 4 therapists and none of them have really helped I can't really afford one right now. My family aren't very supportive it's taboo to talk about mental illness so they ignore my symptoms or brush them off as hormones since I'm a female. Could I be bipolar? Is it just hormones? your insight would be nice I hope to a doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis but your insight will be helpful. ,Bipolar
45900,Unstable bipolar people giving people with bipolar a bad name. I've made forays into dating and I've encountered people who've had bad experiences with unstable bipolar people. Whether it's because of being unmedicated or a comorbid mental illness such as borderline these bipolar people have hurt others and left a bad impression of what people with the medical condition of bipolar are like. However maybe the impression is justified in the sense that almost all people with bipolar bring unnecessary drama to mentally healthy people? When I was unmedicated I know the mania caused trouble. And even medicated I still have some issues and understand that medication only lessens the frequency duration and severity of episodes and does not fully stop it. It makes me sad when I think that maybe no one good will love me because they can do so much better in the sense that they can find someone without bipolar and the baggage that I carry. ,Bipolar
46310,Brother is still manic Flying across country MULTIPLE times with no ID A while ago I posted about brother 27M who was manic eventually we got him admitted into a hospital with a court order clinicians agreed he was manicpsychosisillusions of grandeur etc. He was recently released after 2 weeks court order 'dissolved' as he agreed to voluntary 30day residential treatment. No surprises when he checked himself out after one day of residential treatment... And has now flown himself with another credit card he secretly has to another state without ID.I'm surprised he has been able to get on a plane 4 times now without any ID and just a photocopy of his passportlast ID. Is it that easy to get past TSA? Not really sure what we can do at this point. He's been asking for his passport because he wants to leave the country and we have it locked in a safe. He's clearly still manic. Any advice appreciated thank you.,Bipolar

46048,Got prescribed lamotrigine 50 mg? Not sure what its doing Pretty went to the psychiatrist early December of last year and they give me 2 different kinds of medication neither seem to be helping. I mean I don't get super mad albeit temper was an issue but maybe the police coming kinda made me see sense in getting to upset but still need to sometimes walk out the room and chill out. I don't really feel any different other than real tired and hungry? They said it would help with my lack of motivation and drive. The other medication helps with serotonin levels but again didn't feel anything. My mood is real shitty only with my girlfriend soon to be wife I'll berate her with my rants and angry issues for no reason? Any advice? Found out I have severe depression and a real lack of motivation and drive my mom suffers from bipolar so the doctors assume I have it. Pretty much just wondering if their is other medication or if I need to up my dose or anything of the soft and advice would be amazing thanks ,Bipolar

Its so maddening Ive never really been a crier until my diagnosis in fact I was known for not crying but I never felt blocked up or anything. Im not sure if its a me thing or Im cycling all day or anything. Its just alarming and very perturbing. Has this happened to anyone else. I guess I just feel really scared all the time and thats triggering it?

45953,Drug advice I am 26 and have been diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder after a manic episode that lasted a month and a half. Ive dealt with it my whole life but never saw a doctor for it. In the beginning I was given an anti depressant and Adderall for ADD. The Wellbutrin anti depressant made me horrendously depressed and mixed with Adderall incited violent irrational and unpredictable behavior. I then was prescribed Lamictal for my mood. All three of those sort of mellowed me out. Then I decided to stop Wellbutrin because it made me incredibly forgetful even to the point f frequent black outs and loss of timedays. So now I am currently on Lamictal and a very low dose of Concerta. The concerta is doing nothing. I have horrendous ADD and my memory is pretty much wiped clean every week. I am also extremely EXTREMELY tired mentally and physically every day which is not ok because I am a runner and an avid biker but I havent been able to work out in weeks because of this exhaustion. So basically any insight on the right cocktail ? Thanks for bearing through this rant. Meezy ,Bipolar
46132,Increased armodafinil and hypomania?? So Ive been on nuvigilarmodafinil for almost four years now for hypersomnia. I have been at the 150mg dosage for 3 of those years and just recently wanted to go up to 200 to see what it is like. Note bipolar symptoms started 2 years after I started taking nuvigil and the medicine didnt seem to affect my mood. I have been on the new nuvigil dosage for a week and a half now and have noticed in the past few days that I feel on top of the world and great. This was not how I felt initially but today I woke up before I even took it and felt super happy and irritated like hypomania before I even took the medicine. Is it possible for a 50 mg increase to trigger hypomania or am I just adjusting to the new dosage? Im curious because I have never had mood symptoms as a result of the medicine before. Also online it says that nuvigil doesnt tend to cause hypomania but I just dont know.Thanks!,Bipolar
45516,Just Some Thoughts I was on risperdal up until last year right before exams ended my senior year. I ended it in April due to lactating. I was on 4mg and it helped in every aspect. I did hate being tired the constant headaches heart flutters high blood pressure and gaining weight. It helped with my paranoia so much. It helped with my anxiety a lot.I switched to Abilify but I couldn't afford it on insurance so I switched to lithium. I haven't seen my doctor since I quit my restaurant job and have become a stripper. I'm on lithium but my paranoia wasn't going away so I took a 2mg risperdal last night. I can't sleep when I miss a dose of lithium. I had missed 2 doses and I can't swallow the pills because they are too big for me. I usually break them and put them in yogurt which makes it bearable. Has a metallic taste but it's okay. Better than swallowing a whole pill. The scary thing is I can't tell if I'm going manic anymore because since I was in the hospital at 16 I don't get that high manic I was. I don't even talk fast like I used to. It's more of being highly emotionally unstable. It's more where my thoughts feel like dough in a mixer moving really fast and I can't control the settings. I did a mindful meditation video and that helped a lot. I'm fine right now calm but damn I hate paranoid thoughts. I hate thinking He's only talking to me so he can get dirt on me. He doesn't like me as a person he's faking it so he can make me lose my job. There's so much stress I have and I don't have ativan nor do I want any because I'm trying to rely less on anxiety medications. I haven't had ativan in a few weeks I found one and took it back then but it's been over a month since I ran out of my script. Money has also been tight and I haven't been able to afford food up until last weekend I was living off of noodles potatoes and oatmeal so I didn't want to take my lithium. My job is tricky because when I stay up late I HAVE HAVE to take the next day off because if I keep messing up my sleep cycle I'm super unstable. I will get aggravated at small things. I will get emotional and overthink. That's basically it when I'm off my meds. I don't really get all that delusional but maybe I do? For example when I'm smoking a cigarette I have to pick up a specific one because if I don't pick that specific one then things will be bad. Or if I don't hold something a certain way things will go bad or so i think. I keep overthinking things. I'm paranoid that everyone around me that tries to talk to me doesn't really care for me unless I already know them. For example at work if someone tries to talk to me I don't trust them which is standard in my line of work don't trust anyone. I don't like people talking to me and it's weird because I'll be having a bipolar episode or so it feels when I miss meds but I'm sleepy I'm so so sleepy but if I stay up past 12 all hell breaks loose. I can't sleep my whole schedule is messed up. I have to sleep before 12 to keep myself normal which is hard with my line of work.I know I should find a new job but then again paranoia and fear of rejection. More fear of rejection than anything. Living in fear from high school and the bullying. How people were mean and I just relive high school when I see them but that's a battle of confidence i need to work on myself.,Bipolar

46122,Increased sex drive while manic I've been manic constantly for the past week and my sex drive has been out of control. To the point where my fiance has had to tell me to stop touching her. Not because it's uncomfortable just that she has had enough intimacy and isn't interested in physical contact of the sexual nature.In the past when I've been manic I avoid physical contact all together. I just don't like touching people or being touched. I don't know what it is about this time around but I'm always interested in sexual contact with my significant other.Anyone else had this experience with randomly having an increased sex drive during a manic phase?,Bipolar

46402,What are red flags when seeing a psychiatrist? I am meeting with one and she prescribed me abilify..during the appointment she told me the side effects were sleepiness that's it I went home and read up on how it can cause permanent tardive dyskinesia...is that a red flag if she doesnt tell me that?!? Hello I would never take this sht if she told me.. now I have to go back another appointment to get a different medication when I couldve done it the first time if she asked me. I feel like I should switch. What are signs that the psychiatrist is really bad for you guys??,Bipolar
45513,Well Im bipolar. Hey folks. After a very shitty year where I lost our house to foreclosure our savings and nearly did in my loving family wife and two daughters 13 and 10 Ive been diagnosed as bipolar. The psychiatrist has me on a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant for now which seem to be helping. Theyre still making a full assessment so weve got a ways to go as yet. My wife has been amazing despite the shock of the foreclosure and all the monetary problems shes stayed with me and helped me find well recommended doctors and therapists for help. Weve been going through couples counseling as well to help us get on the same page the couples counselor suggested I might be bipolar which started us working through the diagnosis process and into treatment. My kids havent been told of the diagnosis yet and were not sure if or when we will tell them or how. Personally Im a little freaked out. Ive already been diagnosed as ADD which seems to also be correct but that seems a lesser issue since I am able to hyper focus and accomplish a lot. Or maybe that was a combination of hyper focus and manic episodes. Im having trouble coming to terms with whos right now. Its been a hard blow and has fractured my self image. Ive always considered myself in control of my mind and actions and now I really dont know what Im in control of any more. Its been surreal and Ive been feeling a little lost. I dont have any specific questions at this time I partly wrote this to just make the diagnosis more real. Any comments anyone can provide are welcome. Ive got so much to learn. ,Bipolar

I'm so done with medications.. I wish I didn't have bipolar.... if I can do it without medications I would.. feeling hopeless is just bad.,Bipolar
45514,I stopped taking my meds and I regret it I feel really panicked. I thought they weren't working and that the side effects outweighed the benefit of taking them. I was wrong. I'm just sped up scared for no reason. I can't stand to be apart from my SO while he's at work right now. There's a knot in my throat.

45684,Started Trileptal. Any thoughts on how to manage side effects? Hi! I was recently diagnosed with bipolar. I was previously on Lamictal but I got hives on my feet and elbows that started spreading. So my psychiatrist changed me to Trileptal 300 mg morning and night. I was wondering how do y'all deal with the side effects? What are the side effects you've experienced?I know that I should be thankful that mood stabilizers are working but I really don't know how to cope with how tired I feel. And I'm afraid of the acne side effect. Skincare is one of the only hobbies I really enjoy and it makes me super sad that something that helps me feel stable could interfere with the hobbies I care about. ,Bipolar

46276,miserable tw selfharm and suicide I'm having a horrible depressive episode. It's been over a year that I've felt this empty and hollow inside dissociating. Even in previous episodes I don't think I've felt this much dissatisfaction with any of my hobbies. I have no interest in drawing or gaming I just want to lay in bed and rot away. I can do little more than get up and take a shower every day but I'm trying as hard as I can and it seems like it's only making me feel shittier. I cut myself tonight and I can't stop fantasizing about dying. I'm not actively suicidal but... Death sounds really comforting right now. On the bright side it isn't a mixed episode. I just with I knew when it would be over. ,Bipolar
46243,Was misdiagnosed and put on antidepressants which lead to mania. Not entirely sure of my proper diagnoses. I just didn't have a manic episode like most of you experience I think so I don't know if I believe it. After struggling with severe depressive episodes throughout my life that have caused me to drop out of school lose nearly all the jobs I've worked ect. ect. over 10 years of bullshit I decided to get some proper medical help. Within first day I started taking the antidepressants I experienced a pretty significant shift in my mood. Energy talking felt good. Felt high I guess. I didn't get any sleep that night though and for the next three days I don't know if I got any more than an hour of sleep a night. On each of those next days I felt like I was detached from my body a lot like I was watching myself. I started pacing in my room a lot and felt compelled to talk or else like... idk I felt like something bad would happen. I had no appetite my mind was moving way to fast to focus on anything let alone food. I was totally incapacitated by anxiety and stayed in my apartment the whole time where I feel like my roommates were all looking at me funny and put off by how weird I felt I was acting which is funny because when I asked them about those few days they just told me I was reallly talkative but otherwise they weren't freaked out or anything. Weirdest experience was what felt like a stabbinglightning sensation in my brain. I reallly don't know how to explain that one. In the end I started praying to God to relieve me of my suffering which was weird because I'm an athiest. I didn't take the antidepressants on the fifth day and most of this stuff ceased shortly after though I continued to not sleep very much like 5 hours a night? for a little while.I didn't contact my doctor for a few months because I thought everything was fine. I suddenly started cutting and dying my own hair a lot got multiple piercings and tattoos jumped fair and doing all kinds of other kinda fun wreckless shit never done any of these things before. Drinking a lot and being really social. Started working out got a dream job started dating again felt like my life was getting back in order.Then I just sorta stopped. Real normal for a while.Then the depression came back lost my job gaining weight ect. and I went to my doctor to talk about it and of course all this came up which lead to my diagnosis as BPII. Sure I thing my experience was a bit out of the ordinary but it just doesn't sound like what you guys talk about when you talk about mania.,Bipolar
46141,What is 50mg Seroquel good for? I had a really bad episode and the crash brought along with it severe anxiety and insomnia. My pdoc and I were in the process of adjusting my prescriptions to better handle the stress overload caused by my job. He added in 50mg Seroquel and low dose of Lexapro. My anxiety went away and I could sleep yay! I'm hungry all the time bloated and my muscles get all twitchy and tense if I don't go to sleep within an hourish of my Seroquel dose. So I hate Seroquel. What is 50mg really good for? As far as I understand that low of dose isn't therapeutic level for anything bipolar related. I'm also on Lithium and Lamactil.I can't take time off of work to see my pdoc for several weeks or more and I don't plan to change anything on my own. My job is also still slowly killing me so I'm hesitant to change anything right now too. Question is general curiosity.,Bipolar
45850,Waiting to get into a doctor I moved to Florida about a year ago and I had a lapse in insurance coverage. I used to be on a lot of medication that helped several things and finally had me functioning as an adult. I ran out of these meds about 8 months ago but Ive been managing pretty well lately until this past week. Ive been working a full time job and I deal with stressful people day in and day out. It usually doesnt get to me but I havent been able to get in to see a doctor and I feel so frustrated. Ive had some really bad lows and some mild highs but I feel myself dipping down really low again and Im worried Im going to fuck everything up. On top of having bipolar I also have ptsd and anxiety. Depending on how my bipolar is being treated these things kind of make one or the other worse at times. Im just really frustrated and Ive worked really hard to get to where I am and I dont know how to keep control of everything when I cant even get a doctors office to call me back and schedule me. I dont have a support system anymore and I just feel helplessly lost. I dont usually post personal stuff like this on reddit and Im on my phone and pretty mixed up so sorry for poor writing. ,Bipolar
45720,Possible Misdiagnoses? During the winter of 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar I generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder PTSD and a few years earlier ADHD. At first I felt that my diagnoses made sense and I was willing to take my meds. While there were times where I accidentally or deliberately didn't take them I was mostly consistent. I did in fact feel better in time though there were many ups and downs. The summer of 2017 I felt that my medications were working amazingly. I was productive holding a job writing a book and overall happy. Beginning my first year of college even started off well. Towards the winter I became very overwhelmed but everyone was due to finals. I expected when our winter break came I would calm down. Throughout the break I had very low energy and a few major mood swings. I convinced my boyfriend to go on a road trip to California with me in the span of a few hours. I felt very excited and couldn't stop talking and laughing. Once we got there I was back to feeling depressed and unhappy even more so because I thought going on a trip would help me feel better. I thought maybe the cold weather was what had me down but the change to warm weather made no difference. When we got back in early January I took it upon myself to go off my meds cold turkey which I know is not the best thing to do and I don't want to suggest that to anyone else. I expected my symptoms to worsen from withdrawals but nothing really happened. I was slightly more emotional and less zombie like but nothing major. Since then I've only been taking Mydayis for ADHD and I've felt a lot better than I have in the past five months. I've had relatively normal moods getting sad when something saddening happens or vice versa. This leaves me extremely confused. Is it possible that I don't have the things I was diagnosed with? Or could my symptoms just be taking a break? I had extreme mood swings at the time of my diagnoses and even in the summer briefly. I really just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or has any thoughts.,Bipolar
45499,UGGGHHHH I just took my PM meds that includes something to knock me tf out bc insomnia instead of AM meds.

My tongue and lips basically whole mouth is kind of numb. Mannn I had shit to do today. I took my AM meds that include adderall after puking failed and now that Im typing this..

46114,Struggling with being at work. I'm not sure exactly what is wrong. I have been so great for a long time. We've just had a beautiful baby boy I was so lucky that I got to have almost a year off work to be with him. I had arranged to go back to work and a week before I was due back in I had a hypomanic blip I went to the doctor's about it when I felt it coming on they were beyond useless seriously the NHS is in dire fucking trouble as well as anyone who desperately needs their help they wanted me to postpone going back but financially it was just impossible plus I felt like I could conquer the world so I went back. I was really productive and confident for about a month until the higher dose meds brought me back down and now I'm stable again.The problem now is that I have other medical problems I deal with a lot of pain amp I have epilepsy so there's trying to keep that in check too as well as caring for my son and at this point in time I just can't deal with it all. My concentration for anything other than playing with my son changing him feeding him etc is nil. When he goes to bed at night I pretty much just sit there and stare at what ever nonsense is on the TV because I don't have the brain capacity to even try to enjoy anything like a game or movie or reading or anything. I just sit there and then go to sleep. I have a tonne of support at home my SO is a diamond I am so thankful for him. I really chose well in the life partner department for sure. My family mil amp friends are all super supportive too. So I don't really have much to complain about outside of not coping with work. I used to love my job I was good at it amp I love recognition for when I do a good job but I just don't think I'm good at it anymore. I can barely seem to keep my train of thought together let alone handle the complex shit at work I deal with. I've been trying to think if maybe getting a simpler job would be better I was a cleaner for a while when I was younger and sort of found that therapeutic. But I am quite prideful about my skillset so I'm not sure in the long run whether that would maybe cause more problems than it would fix. I don't know I'm just feeling really frazzled and I'm on the way to work can anyone relate? In a way I wish I was still a bit hypo it gave me the boost I think I needed.,Bipolar
45782,Dx young as Bipolar. Worried about having kids. I would love to be a mother. Im 27 and already know who Im spending the rest of my life with. When his family makes comments like when are you going to have kids?! I cringe internally. I cant imagine going off my medication in order to have a child. I also have a career. The idea of tapering off my meds which could render me as a potential harm to myself is just not possible. Have any bipolar moms on here considered a surrogate? What was your experience like? Did you have children while on your medications? These questions keep me up at night. My fianc is extremely supportive and even tells me it doesnt matter even if we have to adopt. I want a child but I just dont know at what cost. ,Bipolar

I just got denied life insurance I was reluctant to have my doc notes turned over because I feel like it is a violation of privacy but I knew I would be denied if I did not. I understand why they need that information because they are basically bookies trying to set the odds on if you are going to be alive in 20 years. Well it is another tough pill to swallow that this is jus the way it is. This is also the first time my bp has been cited to outright deny something.

This was with the approval of my therapist and psychiatrist after going though a lot of different therapy including DBT. Lately I have been having slight symptoms which because of the therapy I am able to think differently about them instead of being delusional about it. I know it can be super destructive in many ways but I crave mania a lot. Just the euphoria and intense feelings of love towards people and the sex feeling so much better. Is this normal?,Bipolar

Also that my sister and everyone is conspiring against me to show that Im a bad friend to my aunt by engaging me in negative convo about her.

46413,Should I contact BP ex in this situation? Cross posted from rbipolar sos. My BP2 Dumped me last summer in the middle of a mixed episode. Her stated view was that it was because I had made too big a deal out of something to me when she was in a bad space. She left me on the day I had a pretty significant head injury. Because of various medical stuff she had going on at the time we didnt really speak much. We had been planning to marry and move together. That didnt happen. I was completely blindsided by all this. Three months later I left town for medical treatment. Even though she said she wasnt going to do this she completely ghosted me when I left.My treatment hasnt really worked. Eight months later now I am getting closer to being unable to do my work. It looks like I have CTE. I dont have a whole lot of support in life in terms of family and other people and Im losing my livelihood. My personality has changed. I am not planning to continue my life like this and I consider it a matter of maintaining some personal dignity in the face of whats going to be an unpleasant future. Yes Ive done everything I can and Im continuing to try but I live in the United States and theres not a real viable set of alternatives for me. I will probably end my life later this spring or in early summer when I can wrap up what I need to do to not leave a mess other people have to deal with. This question is not about that decision. I have my dignity and the prognosis isnt good.And I dont know because I cant tell whether she has ever come out of this phase or if shes still in it.Should I send her a letter and and tell her goodbye? Its the only unresolved relationship in my life. It would be especially helpful to hear from people with BP. Would you want to hear from me or would it be better just to find out from other people? She was having a hard time with all relationships at the time and I dont believe at least then she hated me. I think she still loved me. I dont want to do it in such a way that would feel weird and manipulative I want to give her something tangible that if she feels anything at all at this point or some point in the future will let her feel some kind of closure or at least that she wasnt abandoned. She doesnt know how bad its been or that its degenerating. How do I say it?,Bipolar

45541,Off my meds for a bit and Im not doing well at all So Im 25 and I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder 6 years ago. I am waiting for insurance to kick in with my new job and unfortunately I can not afford to go to a psych in my new state until the insurance takes effect due to moving into an apartment that isnt affordable. Right now I think Im in a manic episode. Ive had a lot of really bad things happen in the past week or so and for the past 4 days and nights I havent slept more than 4 hours total and I cannot eat. Usually my mania is the typical delusions of grandeur irresponsible spending no sleep etc but thats not whats happening to me this go around. I dont have control over my emotions and Ive been in mental agony over the things I have going on and the lack of sleep or ability to take care of myself have made it a lot worse. Im not sure if this is mania but while I do have insomnia I still am usually able to get at least 5 hours of sleep at night. Ive taken double doses of Benadryl and I just ended up hallucinating and still not sleeping. Does anyone have any idea what might be going on or possibly maybe some advice to help make it out of this? Im scared of what is happening and Im almost to the point of checking myself into a facility but I know if I do that I could potentially lose my job and then I wont have insurance or the ability to provide for myself. ,Bipolar
45956,Medication Shame Today a colleague was talking about how 'lithium the thing used in batteries and other stuff' was also being used to medicate people with 'mental problems'. That those people would end up with scrambled brains. At first I was incredibly embarrassed and upset. However I decided that I needed to say something I'm reasonably close with the other colleagues present although they don't know about my BP they know I've had depression etc. I told this individual that I take lithium and I suffered from depression and Ocd as a teenager. He asked me if I was worried about taking 'something they use in batteries' and I explained that there are many chemicals that are broadly used and that taking lithium helps me to be the best version of myself. Everyone was kind of awkward and I told them that it wasn't something to worry about and that mental health issues need to be discussed openly. The colleague later came and apologized incase they had offended me. My point is don't feel ashamed because you are taking your medication. Be proud because you are working your ass off.,Bipolar

I was really pushed to go after I saw how detrimental it was to those around me and the suicidal thoughts were becoming constant. I was a little disappointed when my doctor suggested medication to help with my treatment. I avoided medication for the longest because I would hate for them to zombify me. I dont wanna be out of it nor feel unlike myself. This leads me to ask does anyone have alternatives for treatment? Has it worked? How long until you noticed a significant improvement? I have so many questions after finally being diagnosed and I just wanna know how to cope and where to go from here. Any input is appreciated!,Bipolar
46041,Hospitalized for the first time This week I was hospitalized for the first time I had taken benzos and either they mixed with the lamictal poorly or it was a bad source but I was black out for over 12 hours starting and terrified my wife and family. I am embarrassed and ashamed and while black out I talked about many things I'd prefer to have kept hidden including sexual frustrations and a long struggle with substances including LSD to my mother in law calling my father and telling him that I was diagnosed even though I hadn't wanted to do so at this point yet. I spent the next 4 days in extreme depression not eating showering talking or sleeping and am finally feeling normal today. I ate talked with my wife and mother in law today showered and got my hair cut. I am still extremely embarrassed of the things that happened during that day.

45529,Hey I think I'm on the verge of an episode. I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and basically this means when I go manic things become hallucinogenic. As of late I have been doing good but not. I've basically been hiding from everything and I've been content with it. Well something happened that woke me up and I'm scared. I don't want to go through psychosis again. I don't want to have to deal with the horror of it all again. I don't want my parents to have to go through it again and I don't either. I loose it when it happens. One time I thought I was the reincarnation of Jonah....and most of the time I was fighting off imaginary demons thinking I was possessed and condemned to hell. It's a nightmare. I just want to be happy and healthy. I am going to be. I want to be a good person. And have a good heart. And I wanna have a head on my shoulders. What action should i take? I do not like my doctor. I just don't really have any connection to him. I want to get this sorted out myself. I don't want to involve my mom and dad. I'm 26 years old.

I already have a job lined up on a floor where I already work as a secretary. I've always worked days. When I start working as an RN I'll probably have the option to work days 7am7pm or nights 7pm to 7am. I still don't know which to choose. I know that working nights is generally a bad idea when you have a mental illness because it messes up your circadian rhythm. But days are faster paced and higher stress and I know that high stress is also bad I you have a mental illness. Either way I'm screwed but I really want this job. I'd love some insight from anyone who has experience with this. Do I a pick high stress job days or a messed up schedule nights?,Bipolar
45572,Nonstop Impulses I always thought my BP2ADD ? was all about distractions. Shiny things and all that. A partly external problem that I just suck at filtering out. I never considered my overpowering urges and habits to be impulsebased and it is revolutionizing the way Im seeing things. I Googled around to learn more and I came across a bullshit shaming listicle from BP Hope I thought they were our friends!!! basically saying just discipline yourself!. As if everybody gets the impulse to stay up into the wee hours organizing their bathroom or the compulsion to spend their whole paycheck on something they didnt give a shit about a week ago or the brilliant idea to start their own business with no money but theyre just better at controlling it. At work it seems to take me twice the time to do things as everyone else and its largely due to constant small but uncontrollable things I have to do.Fuck all that. I figured Id check in with the real BP niaz. Where do you think our nonstop impulses come from and has anyone had any luck with controlling them? ,Bipolar
46203,Seeking advice on a close friend who is having her first episodes. I've got a very close family friend who seems to be experiencing her first experiences with bipolar. Her mother was diagnosed bipolar. My friend has had what clearly seem to be manic episodes with fullon hallucinations as well as very depressive episodes. She believes that her hallucinations are her having a spiritual experience. Even when she is depressed she thinks she is being punished for her behavior. She thinks the truth of the world is being revealed to her.ampx200BWe've been talking to her family and they are afraid to take her to the hospital against her will. The problem is that she is convinced that she is right and everyone is conspiring against her to label her as sick and that they just want to give her drugs to kill her. ampx200BWhat are the other options available to her and her family? Are psychiatrists available for inhome care or diagnosis? How can she get help when she refuses to believe that she has a problem? I'm scared for her safety because her depression gets extremely severe. She thinks that a mass shooting happed because she went out to a club one night. She thinks her small behaviors put peoples lives at risk. She hasn't admitted to being suicidal but I know that there's a strong link between this condition and suicide attempts and it seems like a bad idea to wait for it to get to that point.ampx200BWe tried to wait it out for a while to see if her episodes would let up temporarily enough for her to see that she needs help but she seems to go straight from manic to depressed and back without any break. Or if there is a break it doesn't seem to matter because she thinks everything she's experienced is real and that we can't see the truth. The only time she said she wanted help she meant help in finding someone who will validate her hallucinations.ampx200BMy family and hers aren't sure what to do but she clearly needs help. Any suggestions or resources you might have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!,Bipolar

I have bipolar 2 and anxiety Ive been pretty much stable with little dips into mild depression for awhile. I was only taking gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. Gabapentin was the first mood stabilizer I ever tried and its always kept my hypomania at bay and my anxiety dialed down a little. Hydroxyzine comes in for sleep and breakthrough anxiety. It works. Im productive and mostly good. But the little dips into mild depression started to string together and I feared I might go into a deep depressive episode so I just told my doctor I want to add an SSRI. Were trying Celexa right now. So I took it last night she said some people prefer night some morning for the first time and couldnt sleep very well. So Im definitely going to switch to the morning from now on. I had a little stomach upset but not too bad. I slept less than I need to but I feel really good this morning. Im still on my gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. And will go back to take just the hydroxyzines at night so I go back to sleeping normally. BUT I dont know if its too soon to tell obviously its been like 12 hours but this morning I got up feeling really optimistic and happy to start my day. Maybe this is placebo effect although Im usually skeptical that things will work or maybe Im just super lucky with things working on the first try. I dont know. Just letting yall know that Im feeling optimistic and happy. I felt pretty good before but let my doctor know even though I was stable I was still struggling a little with depression and Im hopefully this addition works out. ,Bipolar
45894,Prozac and periods? Also eczema? Has anyone taking this medication had side effects that caused them to spot brownpink between periods? I'm getting anxious because I have been and this isn't at all normal for me. I've had HPV and a LEEP for CIN III so I'm worried that if it isn't the med causing it that I have a bigger issue. Also I have broken out in an eczema type rash on my face since beginning this med. I have tried hydrocortisone to get rid of it and it isn't helping. I've never in my life had eczema before.Are these potential side effects of this med? Should I call my Dr? I asked her about the face rash and she said she hadn't heard of it being a side effect before... This was a couple weeks ago before the spotting started.My period isn't due for another 7 days and it's normally like clockwork. Extremely predictable. ,Bipolar

46045,Help Explaining to my family Hello! I was recently diagnosed eh sort of. The doctor agrees I'm bipolar but she doesn't like labels and she's trying me on antidepressants first since my hypomania isn't terrible quite yet and so... since I'm only 20 and on my parents' insurance I had to tell them about what's going on. My mom just asked me how I'm feeling on my new medication and I explained to her that it's too soon to tell. However that question sort of evolved into a conversation about what depressive episodes even feel like and I... got stuck trying to explain.How would you explain depression and hypomania to someone who hasn't experienced either? I need to be able to explain this to my mom and also to my younger brother who is 16. If there's any resources I could link them I'd very much appreciate that too.,Bipolar

I started taking Quetiapine Seroquel a few months ago and while I've certainly had less negative thoughts and have been more functional I feel like I'm no longer as creative as I used to be something which affects my education as well as what I do with my free time absolutely nothing.

45738,Definitely depression but could there be something else too? Thanks in advance! I'm in my early 20's currently a fulltime student currently seeing a counselor at my university for the depression I had from Octoberearly February.Some background Had an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive father growing uphad cycles of depression as a teen but nothing as bad as this past fall never before gotten treatment for it.used to have anger issues that I've been working on and have mostly gotten better.I used to be and still have worries in the back of my mind about some new super bug plague wiping out humanity apocalyptic scenarios before dystopian books were a thing or at least before it was on my radar generally was and am irritable at times can't stand footleg bouncerstappers and gum smackingas a result I feel pretty trapped in lecture halls. Something that also seems to stand out to me is that a year or two ago I got uncontrollably angry literally shaking mad at my roommate for no reason and had to go on a really long walk.Currently During my depressed period I had foggy cotton ball brain couldn't concentrate trouble sleeping and staying asleep the irritability suicidal thoughts all the time racing thoughts.Early last week I kinda started feeling better one day everything looked more vivid. That sounds weird but color had a touch more color bright things were more bright. The next day I was so elated and have been ecstatic each morning. Waking up has been easy for the first time in a long time. I'm not riddled with self doubt or constantly wondering if I'm annoying people by talking to them. I'm actually excited for my future. I got cheap new clothes that fit so I don't have to wear my sweatpants every day any more.Today I woke up early did a bunch of errands got more clothes ran for the first time since September did my usual short workout routine twice and even went to an event at my university.It's nice to finally be happy but it feels wrong to be THIS happy so suddenly after having suicidal thoughts all day every day.I meant to talk to my counselor about all this this morning but she was out sickso instead I am asking for any personal experience or thoughts on this to see if I might be way off base or not here. ,Bipolar

45752,Latuda WithdrawalsAkathisia Hi AllI was put on Latuda for about 3 weeks 1 at 10mg 2 at 20mg as my previous stabiliser wasn't doing much for me. I assumed my worsening depressionanxiety were withdrawals but by week 3 I ended with akathisia that has really fucked me up.Pdoc took me off it immediately and prescribed me 0.25mg Xanax to take as needed which I had been taking one or two of intermittently to cope with the transition It's been 12 days since my last Latuda dose but I'm still having major depressionpaniccrying fits and I'm concerned that the longer I take the Xanax the more reliant I'm going to become on it. I'm already taking between 1.252mgday and while I'm having more frequent periods of stability it's sometimes taking more Xanax to get there and boy do I come crashing down hard once that 5 hour mark passes.Has anyone had similar experiences coming off Latuda? I'd think that with only 3 weeks on I'd be in the clear by now but I've heard some horror stories and I'm also terrified of replacing one set of symptoms with another the longer I stay on Xanax.Thanks.,Bipolar
45766,Is lithium making me manic or did I forget what good feels like? I have a new doc and at the same time new insurance that won't cover Latuda. My old doc hadn't tried lithium for whatever reason so this new doc is giving it a shot. I'm on a super low dose and while I titrate off the Latuda he's going to raise it in small increments.And I feel great! I'd been in a depressive episode for two weeks and that is out the window. I've been more productive this week than the past two months. I have a renewed sense of energy and positivity and somehow am less anxious too. Am I overreacting? Or is this the start of mania? The thing that's got me a little bugged out is that while I used to wake up groggy and hating the world I've woken up before my alarm clock went off. Last night I got an hour less sleep and felt like a million bucks today. Also unrelated but what do you lithium folks do about pain? I used to take 800mg ibprofen for my migraine and now I can't. Tylenol has done jack all for me in the past.,Bipolar

About a year ago when I was in a very low period I was hospitalised on 3 separate times where I was unable to move speak or pretty much function which lasted for about 6 hours. Before these episodes set in I remember being heavily suicidal and feeling hopeless and like I had no energy at all like I was melting into the chair and then seeing visuals in my surroundings.The bit that is funking with my head is whether my mind is playing tricks on me and I could actually move and speak but I was pretending or whether it was all legitimate.

45876,Meds and memory Hi everyone I'm new to this forum and was diagnosed with BP2 less than a year ago. I'm on a medicine regimen that is working really well for my mood however my body has adjusted to it and my memory attention and focus are still no where near where they were pretreatment. Which I'm a biochem student and I have finals in less than two months so this isn't ideal. Currently im on 100mg seroquel I don't think this is effecting my memory very much it's the first thing the started me on tbh if it is this id rather have the sleepAnd 100mg lamictal I'm pretty sure this is the culprit but idk if stopping it and trying to find something else while school is on session would be safer or riskier in terms of cognative abilitiesThey had me on buspar but i stopped taking that within a few weeks of school starting because it was just impossible. And stopping that helped a lot and then he raised my lamictal and it's still better than it was but not where it needs to be.I'd really rather not take amphetamines but if anyone has had similar problems with these or could suggest something that's helped them so I could do some research and bring it up with my doc in a few weeks thatd be wonderful.also side note I think the lamictal was making me anemic so I doubled up on my iron and B vitamins so im not sure it might still be due to some level of anemia,Bipolar
46091,Small bursts of elevated mood while in a depressed phase? Hi there I am new here. Two days ago I was told by my therapist that I could be diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and recommended meds.I never realised that I might have something like this. If anyone would be so kind and answer my very clueless questions that would be amazing. My cycles of hypomania and depression are long ? so I tend to have a few months of depression and then one or maybe two months of hypomania. When I am in my depressed state I sometimes feel for a very short time that I will switch phases into hypomania again because I feel energised happy and productive. It only lasts for a few hours maximum and then goes back to the depression though. More often than not it happens in the middle of the night. Is this possible that there are smaller cycles in big cycles I hope this is understandable as I am not an English native speaker sorry. or could this be a sign that I actually am not bipolar? And how long are cycles in general allowed to be when it stems from bipolar disorder?If anyone takes the time and reads this thank you so much!!!,Bipolar
46290,Probably the most ridiculous way of fighting my negative thoughts First off I've been a Queen fan since my early childhood. I probably knew all the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody by four or five. I was as much of a fan as any poor kid whose family couldn't afford a CD player and was limited to the radio and her parents cassette tapes could be. The movie was right up my alley.Anyways a pattern of my depressive episodes combined with my comorbids is the worse most negative loathsome thought patterns often about my physical appearance. To combat this I have given my attempts at more positive self talk the most flamboyant happy Freddie Mercury voice and wordings I can imagine. And it's working. Yeah it's really really weird and kinda stupid but until i can stand on my own two feet one of my childhood idols can ight the demons for me.,Bipolar

45486,Struggling to readjust my sleeping pattern after depressive episode any tips? Hi all. I'm looking for some practical advice.I've been pretty depressed the past couple months since I quit my job in October. I'm also studying at Uni and have like 6 hours of contact time a week. I've really been struggling to find a reason to get out of bed in the morning and so my sleeping pattern has been destroyed.My circadian rhythm is now set almost in reverse. I don't feel tired until 45 am in the morning and wake up around 34 pm in the afternoon. I've upped my meds Seroquel which used to help me sleep at night but it isn't really making much difference at the moment. I'm desperate to try and readjust my pattern because it's making my low mood even worse. It gets dark early here in the winter so I have no exposure to sunlight. I'm running on a different time to everyone else so I get minimal socialisation. It's preventing me from passing out of my depressive phase big time.,Bipolar
45772,Major study the debate is settled anti depressants do work Scientists say they have settled one of medicine's biggest debates after a huge study found that antidepressants work.The study which analysed data from 522 trials involving 116477 people found 21 common antidepressants were all more effective at reducing symptoms of acute depression than dummy pills.But it also showed big differences in how effective each drug is.Major takeaways EDIT Anti depressants do work better than placebos for most people but their effectiveness varies.More people could be helped by antidepressants.Anti depressants don't work for everyone. EDIT Please note as uthatonejessica rightly pointed out the study excluded trials that included 20 or more of participants with bipolar disorder.

46054,Ways to help until I can get on meds? Hi! I'm a freshman in college who's had a long history of mental health. I had to drop out of school last year after I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. My doctor said it was anxiety and basically send me to CBT and told me to get back to school. I've always had ups and downs where for a couple of days I feel like I'm on top of the world and can run 5 miles easily. I can study without distraction and can get my work done. Other days I'm too exhausted to get out of bed and I easily snap at people. I can barley do the things I love like read my book or play my Xbox. My mom has been insistent that I have Bipolar Disorder she's kept a notebook with all my Up and down behavior and notices a pattern. I can't get a psychologist until May since the University ones refuse to take me until next semester. Is there anything I can do to lessen the symptoms until I get on the meds? Thanks so much ,Bipolar
45476,I think the police are coming Last night I took my normal medication and vitamins for Bipolar I. Then I started the shower on 100 hot. I pulled out. Few other medications just 2ish doses and took them. I just wanted to see what it could feel like. I showered nice and hot I'm a girl so the fires of hell would be comfortable lol then laid down and listens to my playlist. The steamy bathroom and songs I love felt good.My husband woke up at 1am to use the restroom and asked me' what the hell are you doing? Then moved on. I have been hiding this for so long. Thinking and planning and trying to figure things out. On my way to work he told me to drop my attitude and I lost it and told him everything. Everything I've kept secret for 9 months. I told him my final plan and what I'd done.He told me to go home or he'd call the police to my work. So I kept on going to work. He's not my master. But I don't want them to take me. I have a degree in psychology and this isn't my first or fifth run of this. I know what to say to stay out. But this is the first time a family member has called. I don't want to go. It won't help or change how I feel. I have an amazing therapist psychiatrist and Dr. I'm not emotional or desperate. I just don't want to try every day like this. Trying to look and act normal and happy. Yesterday my husband and mother in law told me I'm doing a shit job covering it. So what's the point anyways? I can't hide it. No one wants to hear it. I told my husband I want his support but the only thing he will say is he is calling the police. So maybe they are coming maybe not. ,Bipolar
46356,Lamictical and depakote Okay! Sorry in advance on mobile. So June 1 2018 I had my third child. I was diagnosed bipolar a few years ago and never really took eating healthy very seriously. After I had my third baby I lost my mind. Anyways we started working with a doctor and trying to find treatment. She started me off with lamictical ? Spelling and I had never been happier! It worked wonderfully and it was the best two months of my mental health in a VERY long time at least 10 years. While I was upping my doses slowly I got the dreaded rash. So off of that. Since then Ive been on at least 7 different kinds of medication and keep having to switch because of side effects ruining my life. Everything from weight gain to hallucinations. I still havent lost any of the weight that meds caused me to gain at least 50 pounds. I went and saw my doctor today and she wants me to be on a mix of depakote extended release because immediate didnt work and fluoxetine. Im asking for any and all advice. Trying this many different meds in such a short amount of time is awful. Its taking a toll on not just me but my family. I need to get this crap figured out! Im almost to a point where I dont wanna be medicated at all because apparently?! None work for me. Im so disappointed and discouraged. Has anyone had this cocktail of meds and had it work? ,Bipolar
46257,Tardive Dyskinesia medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone Its hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent 13 I think but I have been bipolar since I was a young child and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now so still young but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first surprisingly fine and stable but now I have been manichypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before. I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment. Its just at my last appointment before the mania started we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication. I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again. I dont really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to dont get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with. Its like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child with consistent therapy with medication and with A LOT of everyday effort is going to be ripped out from under me and its not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. Its scary. Its a lot. Sorry this is so long. I hope there are still people willing to read it. ,Bipolar

45970,ObsessionStrong passion that quickly goes away For a lot of my life I have become completely obsessed with many things. They feel like passions. They feel like it's the best thing ever. But then I suddenly lose interest. It happens on small and large scale. Small obsessions go from being completely obsessed with one music artist or style of music for maybe a month or less to a point where I can't think of anything else. I play the same stuff over and over and over again and eventually lose interest and move on. This happens to a lot of people but it spreads to other things. A lot of my hobbies are like this. Sculpture painting working out video games there's do many. On a larger scale When I was in college I switched my major 4 times because I would get completely obsessed and passionate with the major then suddenly I would lose so much interest that it became hard to go to class focus do homework etc so I would eventually switch majors. My last major I decided to stick with because I couldn't afford to change any more so I just dealt with it and did the minimum to get my degree. This happens with jobs too. I'll really truly love a job work there for 6 months and then start dreading it every day. My hobbies do this my interests do this my life is just like this and I don't want it any more. I try so hard to be passionate for things and sometimes these passions come back for a bit but nothing sticks. Ever. It never has. Does this happen to anyone else? Does anyone have any advice? I'm 26 and I can't keep living my life like this. ,Bipolar

I've tried everything I can think of from therapy CBT and going to my doctor to exercise dieting lifestyle changes meditation supplements and so on. I can't access meds. I don't have any offline support network.The past year was the year with the least depression for me. I didn't really want to die anymore but I wouldn't have minded either way. I tried all of the above things. I still doubt I can ever hold down a job have a relationship or study. I'm pretty close to being kicked out of school again. This past week the day I spent the most time not crying or laying in bed was new years eve. I think 2 hours for a movie and 2 hours for a meal with family. I could bear to listen to music today and didn't throw up my lunch so that's an improvement.But even at my best I don't know what to do. I just don't want to live.

45812,My new psychiatrist doesn't agree with my current diagnosis Starting in 2009 age 17 I had increasingly awful depression reaching a peak in late 2014 age 22 when I checked myself into hospital for 5 days outpatient then 7 days inpatient. After this my meds were switched from Paxil and Abilify to Effexor XR. In early 2017 age 24 after gradually increasing the Effexor I was bumped to 225mg a day. This sent me into a hypo manic episode for a week until I dropped it back to 150mg. My body couldn't keep up with my mind I had no filter and I did things without thinking.This lead to my psych to change my diagnosis from Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder Type 2 rapid cycling as we believed that this wouldn't have happened if I didn't have bipolar paired with how I had described my depressive episodes as wavelikeebbing and growing for years. I added on lithium 300mg 2xday at this time.Now I'm in a new state and have a new psych age 25. I went to her last week for Rx refills and because I had the worst shortterm depression in years. I couldn't work or even get out of bed for 5 days.She says the the Effexor Lithium combo seems to have helped with some issues anxiety bulimia selfharm but isn't doing enough for the depression. She upped my Lithium to 300mg 3xday and is seeing me March 13th. Her main issue is that I don't have any issues with sleep during my up periods. I sleep normally. When I'm depressed I sleep a lot more and have trouble getting up in the morning.What my issue is If I don't have bipolar what are the other possible disorders I could have? What runs similarly to bipolar but isn't? Is there such thing as cyclical depression? If I don't have bipolar what the hell was that episode in early 2017? I asked my new psych something like this when I saw her but she didn't have an answer for me just shrugged it off...I'm not asking that you diagnose me just what is similar to bipolarEdit added info,Bipolar

46459,Depressive State Seeking Advice I'm currently feeling really trapped in a depressive state and I don't know how to get out of it. I'm more accustomed to dealing with depression as I was initially diagnosed with depression for 2 years be for ending rediagnosed. But I just can't seem to find my way out. I know I have a lot to be happy and grateful for and I'm trying to engage in activities that I enjoy doodling baking etc. but I feel pretty stuck this time. I don't know why. Sometimes I'll feel like I'm getting out but then I'll fall right back down. And I feel like I keep making stupid decisions in this state of mind honestly I make bad ones in a manic state too I just want to be stable for a while at least.Basically Any advice on getting out of a depressive state?,Bipolar
45935,Differences between bipolar 1 and 2? So a week ago my therapist told me I was displaying symptoms of bipolar disorder and at the time he thought I was manic with that being said what are the differences between bp1 and 2 other than hypomania and mania? And how can I tell the difference between a manic episode and a hypomanic episode?? I'm seeing a psychiatrist this week two actually trying to see if I should switch and I'm kind of??? Really confused. I'm not sure if when my therapist said manic he meant hypomanic or if it was just an assumption and I shouldn't even be here. I'm just struggling with figuring this out..,Bipolar
46110,Getting manic after what I thought was the most stable period of my life post diagnosis I had a terrible terrible mixed state episode in the Fall and early winter but Zyprexa really stabled me out. I hadn't been that stable in years. I am able to read again and I'm just so happy to be content if not a little bored and dulled out which was worth it for me.I used to like mania but now I don't. It only promises a dark period of time in the fallout.I'm so angry but most of all I don't know whether or not to reach out to my parents who I still live with. They're so proud of me and every time I have a new episode they are so shocked as if it's never happened before. But you were doing so well they say and it makes me want to cry and scream. I feel so guilty.I'm trying to finish school and I'm terrified that my stability won't last long and I'll be stuck forever in this crazy up and down up and down.I'm just so angry and I'm trying to stay off screens and focus on journaling and writing poetry and socializing but it's still creeping up on me. I hate this and I'm scared.,Bipolar
46067,Good news Shitty news Less Shitty news and GoodHorrible ideas Good News I am finally out of my depressive episode that I have been dealing with for about a year! other a 4 day medication induced hypomania that was quickly resolved by adding a typical antipsychotic WOOT. Better News I was offered a position that will be part of a 3 year national research project that will be working with the same population I am already working with people with severe and persistent mental illness. Once I announced that I'd be leaving my current organization I found out that despite me not feeling like I fit in with my team due to our extremely different backgrounds and ages that they really DO value me as a team member and the contributions I have made to our program! I thought that this coupled with more daylight hours was contributing to my decrease in depressive symptoms. Shitty News I am starting to notice yellow and red flags of swinging into hypomania despite not taking my stimulant medication and abstaining from caffeine I have had three hours of sleep in the past 3 days and am not tired. Tense body and jaw clenching speaking at a faster pace than my baseline and being way more chatty than normal and last but not least impulsive shopping for big ticket items that last one is more of a red flag. Less Shitty News I had the cash to do it without spending bill money or putting it on my credit card and I still have enough in my accounts necessities until next payday Good Idea Talking to my therapist about this tomorrow at my appointment and following up with my psychiatrist about this and trialing a new antipsychotic while starting a new job. Out of the 4 I have been on only one did not turn me into a zombie. But I did develop temporary tardive dyskinesia after being on it for a few months so it was discontinued and the TD went away. Horrible Idea Not bringing this up so I can ride the wave at my last week at my current organization and for the first few weeks at my new job.Quess which idea seems more appealing right now as I am awake at 4am and I have an all clinic staff meeting at 8 with an hour and a half commute in good weather. I know what I should do but goddamn I just want a lil taste of it. Edit I do have some what of a crisis plan set up with my mom so that I don't spend ALL of my money or rack up credit card debt wherein I get an agreed upon amount of cash for the week out of my checking account and she holds on to all of my cards so I cannot absolutely fuck myself and kiddo finacially. ,Bipolar
45628,Antipsychotics and stimulants? Hello hi. I was recently prescribed Modafinil to take with my current combo of meds rexultitrileptal vybriid and Ive started to get frustrated at the lack of effects from the Modafinil which I assume is because of the rexulti dopamine antagonist. Has anyone else felt like their stimulants dont work because of atypical antipsychotic? and have been able to do something about it? I think Im going to try and convince my psych to let me taper off the rexulti and increase the trileptal. Does anyone know if trileptal is also a dopamine antagonist? Im so frustrated!! Maybe rexulti is the reason I cant study in the first place. Gimme back my dopamine ,Bipolar
45670,Im in a weird place I think I always see people saying they like being hypo but Im depressed right now and its kind of a relief. Although Im sad for no reason apathetic is probably more fitting and Im not eating and am just so tired all day and dont really leave my bed.. Im still keeping up with my hygiene which usually goes right out the door when I get depressed. But my mind is like on vacation. I havent changed a thing with my meds. I take them around the same times every day. I have been crying a little bit more. For the longest time I didnt cry at all. I might actually be sad about something. I mean I for the most part hate myself and my life but thats an everyday thing. Maybe my mind isnt as on vacation as I thought. Im just happy for lack of a better word to not be manichypo bc Im starting to think that I get more mixed than anything. Im possibly even mixed right now but on the more depressed side if it works that way. I dont think Im making sense. Is it possible to be in an almost constant mixed episode but either lean manic or depressed? I thought I had a pretty descent grasp on bipolar but fuck idk,Bipolar

45796,Alternatives to Lamictal Hi guys. I have bipolar 2. Ive been on Lamictal for about three years I think. But I think its giving me a rash. I have eczema so its hard to tell. My dermatologist took a biopsy to see if the rash is being caused by the med. Meanwhile Im kind of a mess. Im gonna need a mood stabilizer. I talked to my psychiatrist today on a Saturdaycalled and left a msg and she called me back. Shes going to see me tomorrow yes on a Sunday! at no charge. She asked me if I had ever been on Depakote. I have not. She wants to try that for now. I should get the results of the biopsy by the end of next week. Have any of you with bipolar 2 ever taken Depakote?,Bipolar
45631,Anyone else have trouble consistently taking their meds? Just last year while in jail actually after coming down from a manic episode and then spiraling further into the latter I was finally confronted again with my type 1 bipolar diagnosis. I was lit back on my meds depakote ER trazadone gabapentin and prasosin and stayed on them until being transferred to a rehab facility as a result of trauma undiagnosedmisdiagnosed bipolar I developed a really shitty and extreme addiction issues where they were hostilic and took me off my meds. One manic episode in and they made a exception for that rule quickly....lol. after that and making a timeline of my relapses and it being made clear as day that taking my meds for me is a matter of life and death because of my addiction I stayed on them and stable for a few months. I had a slip where I stopped taking my meds went manic after a week relapsed but was able to catch myself before everything went to shit...but again a few months later the same thing happened I wasn't so lucky and have been stuck in another relapse for a few months and self medicating.I now find myself very aware I need my meds. J talked to my therapist today who essentially told me that I need to accept my diagnosis and that I need to take my meds if I want to succeed based on all the past times I've tried anything otherwise. I've had intentions of calling my psych doctor I plan to but I'll pick up the phone and put it down. Or procrastinate it. When manic I'll say that it will keep me from fulfilling my purpose or take away my ability to feel fully and see the future. I KNOW I need to. I plan on calling first thing tomorrow for the first possible appointment. I want to get better. But I won't stop fucking myself over.Does anyone else have this issue? Or can relate? I'm just now starting to realize I'm not crazy or alone and it's in fact my bipolar that's effecting my life like this. And I would appreciate anyone who has similar issue's input on this. This is my first post here.. sorry for the wall of text and I hope it meets all the community guidelines. Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far.,Bipolar
45851,Meltdowns at work and ruining relationships advice? Ive been struggling with bipolar and Ive tried so many different meds none has worked for me. In the past 2 years I had 2 ectopic pregnancies which triggered a meltdown that required me to transfer to a different location. Then I had a meltdown in November because Im so exhausted with my current job. Its customer service and sometimes I have to handle picky clients. Started taking just klonipin to help my nerves. Ended up causing a huge fight because I took too many and felt like I could stick up for myself for once. Broke up with my boyfriend. Ended up getting back together. Things havent been the same since. Long story short I recently found out that during that time we broke up he added was talking or trying to talk to girls on social media. Im normally not the person to go through peoples phones but I had a really weird feeling by the way he was acting. Im overly jealous. Its a flaw. Which caused another meltdown. Well i really cant control my moods at this point. Ive been crying at work 247 recently. How embarrassing. I started partying too much again. Black out drinking klonopin weed I cant sleep at night. Its the only temporary fix that makes me happy for a moment. I did stupid shit Im too embarrassed to even say the past couple weekends at parties. I feel super guilty too. I tried killing my self either last weekend or the weekend before. I cant even remember because Im too mentally drained. I cant get these thoughts out of my head. I feel guilty and I hate myself. I dont feel bad for myself at all. I think Im a disgusting human being and really dont care about life anymore. I would call off but if you get so many points you get fired plus I really like the people I work with for the most part and dont want to leave them hanging. So ANYWAYS after that nice short summary I dont feel mentally stable to go to work for the rest of the week and I have a mandatory 8 hour meeting tomorrow. Honestly I dont even think its worth going good to because I want to quit. I dont have a back up plan set in stone and i dont even care anymore. Im that done. I want to move far away and start over from scratch or Im probably going to kill myself sometime soon. Rant over! Sorry for how long it was. Im desperate at this point. Im embarrassed to talk to anyone and be honest about my condition and how I havent taken any meds.,Bipolar
45939,Massive disagreement between wife Bipolar Type II OCD and GADI really appreciate anyone that takes the time to weigh in on this.My wifes parents did not like me when we first started dating. They were incredibly restrictive and would only let her out to see me once a month. We got tired of that and started sneaking around to see eachother. During that time we had sex and for LDS culture that is wrong before marriage. Her parents are very strict Mormons and are the type to judge the hell out of you and spread rumors throughout the church.Come 5 months after dating they filed police reports that I was a sexual offenderrapist and needed to be imprisonment for the protection of their daughter. This paper they wrote up was so detailed i wouldnt be surprised it was in fucking MLA format. It was all based on things she had wrote in her journals which they photocopied as well and attached to the police report. They then destroyed her phone threatened not to let her go to church because I was there This went all through the regional church and suddenly my family and myself were completely ostracized. Incredible restriction went by for the next year and a half. During that time they started using the money in her banking account without her knowledge at all. They didnt stop until threatened to sue which under the circumstances I was able to which they then suddenly had all the money appear again. She was saving for when she turned 18 so we could get her the hell out of there. Which we did.Once she turned 18 she moved in with me we severed contact for months with her parents. They stated her sisters werent allowed to come to our apartment because they feared Id rape them. Blocked anyone that supported us from Facebook and any callingtexting and they went on like nothing happened.Now she has gone a long time without any support besides myself and my parents. We are still active in our church but one very far from where this all happened. She doesnt feel like she has any support from anyone so she started turning to her parents again. Her mom is incredibly manipulative and has proven herself to be.For the last few months she has been trying to essentially convince me that if I just let it go talk to them and suddenly be happy about it all again everything will be better.I was diagnosed with BPII only two months ago and before that I had to drop out of my double honors meteorology chemistry major program because my depression ruined my GPA lost my scholarships lost my job. Since then Ive been seeing a therapist twice a month changed all my Meds around and got my grades withdrawn and been recovering.My therapist was appalled to hear this story and thinks Im completely justified in not wanting to have anything to do with them. I have told my wife many times I will talk to them when Im ready and forgive them when Im able to let it go. But after she goes to dinner with them very Sunday this topic comes up where I need to forgive them start going to dinner and fix all this. The thing is she wants me to fix it her way and for what she wants. Which under other circumstances would be completely viable but I hate them. I hate her parents for two years of absolute hell. To this day they have never approached or tried to talk to me in person havent apologized. Nothing. For me that is the first step they need to initiate it. Then I will talk. My therapist agrees and honestly doesnt think I need to fix this at all right now and thinks Im completely justified in the way Im thinking.Am I over reacting? I dont know when Im overreacting with my anxiety and been in a depressed episode for a year now.Any thoughts would be appreciated.,Bipolar
45947,Venting about getting help Just venting since I would like to get therapy and psychiatric help but its so hard to start when I switch constantly from anxious and restless to sluggish and always exhausted. I have a history of severe depression since like 11 years old but the SSRIs I took when I started treatment in high school made me manic. Now Im 25 a few years back my doctor started treatment for bipolar after I had severe anxiety as well but the medication I took was very powerful and the side effects were harsh and I was in school so I stopped... its now worse than ever and as a result I dont really have the sleep schedule or willpower or energy or mental frame of mind to get medical help or therapy. No matter what my mind wants it gets vetoed depending on my state so ultimately I dont get anything done and just spend the day unfocused. I also have severe agoraphobia depending on the moodcycle Im in usually when Im depressed so I rarely leave my apartment. I know if I could just get started and get to a doctor it would get a lot better.Thanks for listening,Bipolar

Im actually stable for the first time since I was diagnosed. I was super anxious last night and realized something. I quit my job this month. Im impulsively spending and its causing issues in my relationship. Im not sleeping much. I cut all my hair off yesterday after pulling an all nighter and Ive been very anxious.

46061,What helps or hurts in a work setting? Hi Everyones got different skills interests and goals but I was wondering if you could share aspects of your work environment that make a difference for you for better or worse. My SO has bipolar DO and is looking for work. He found something that seemed good on the face of it turned out they wanted him to do rotating shifts ie a month straight on nights. Between that and the long commute it was a less than ideal setup. Im wondering what other environmental factors are worth considering when looking at potential jobs. Could include management style size of organization big orgs might have decent HR staff and can afford to handle sick day requests but maybe the right smaller employers could offer a better culture ? Anything you can think of.Hes looking at sales or customer service as possibilities I think sales especially would suit his personality in many ways but wonder how the stressors might affect him competition with coworkers for commissions managing disappointment dealing with complaints etc... hes very personable and likes people so I can see that working for him its just the other stuff i worry might stress him out. Input from anyone in those fields would be amazing. Thank you!,Bipolar

8324,I have suffered from social anxiety and swings of depression for years 28 yo. Most of my friends I have kept joined the military long term so I only communicate every once in a while through text or call. I met a girl almost a year ago who had so many common interests it was crazy. Even the mental health problems. We used to work together but I recently got a new job. We saw eachother almost every day and talked EVERY single day without getting into too much detail we were MUCH closer than your average best friend. I have been working on myself for a little over a year and Id say my mental state for the most part is much better than its been the past few years and she has been much help with my journey. But at times I would start arguments with her over minuscule things that at the time I feel are big. Last week started many little fights that added up. I had the first panic attack I have had in years and stupid me started drinking I am not an alcoholic I just needed something to clear my head She asked for space but I kept texting her I told her I was going to commit suicide because of her ignoring me and that I was going to go to her house. I was not going to actually go anywhere as I was inebriated and I was not intending on physically harming her if that is what it sounds like I just looked for any outlet of attention. At this point there was no return. I quickly realized the damage I had done no one should have to deal with the emotional trauma I gave her. Its been almost a week and she wants nothing to do with me. I am not typically a dependent person but in my entire life I have never met someone so relatable and I screwed it all up. I have made a few attempts to mend things but she wants no part. I know the answer is give her space and expect that its over and move on but I feel terrible. I now have no one I am alone but worse I have hurt her to the point of her being scared of me. My entire family line suffers from depression or bipolar and I see no light at the end. I screwed up a year long friendship in hours time,Depression

7358,Currently 22. Life keeps getting progressively getting worse. Had pretty much everything going for me coming out of HS lots of friends a girlfriend who loved me good family life confidence etc. Things pretty much started to go down hill when I started college out of state. Gf broke up due to distance she went to a different school. This pretty much sent me into a depression have not gotten out of it. Did some of the right things joined a fraternity went out a good amount. Just never really developed a close group of friends at my new school just kind acquaintances who came and went. Long story short developed a drug and alcohol problem and slowly but surely have become a loner. Most people I either got sick of my bs or just have moved on to their new lives now and most of my class has graduated. Have about 23 people I would consider friends both at home and in school. Now I am a 22 year old sophomore.Troubles with the law and an accidental overdose in the past 2 years have just made things worse both mentally and in my day to day life. On probation so going out to bars and socializing is pretty much out of the picture I go to a partysports school in a s town so that pretty much makes up 95 of the social life Been sober for 8 months and honestly just feel worse from when I had a drug problem. At least then I had confidence and the motivation to go out and at least make the effort to improve my life. Now I just sit in my apartmentroom all day. do not have motivation to try and make new friends because of how many times I have failed at it and a lack of self esteem. Tried countless therapists and different antidepressants. Just feel stuck and I do not know what to do anymore. Just going through the motions. Life keeps getting worse,Depression

Its because I hate my job and I feel like I am in the wrong field doing something I do not enjoy. I cannot quit as I got bills to pay and I am married and being jobless is not an option. I feel so trapped and do not know how to proceed. I feel like shit everyday. I work from home so I have no human contact other than my wife.

8072,This is always when you gets bad for me. it is always late at night and I do not know who to turn to so I guess I am here. I know I do not have it near as bad as others but but when I get low I just...sit around. I tell myself that it is too early to go to bed. So I do not. I tell myself I want to play a video game as I love that and I just scroll my library for 2 hours. Convincing myself I do not want to play any of the 150 games I have. The worst part is I SEE it happening to me. I am fully aware I am in a slump and I do not know how to get out. It terrifies me. Any tips for breaking through the fog? How do I stop feeling like I want to and do not to do anything at the same time?,Depression
7390,I feel trapped in my own life. I have a labyrinth of activities that use to pull me out or at least distract me from of my depression but they are proving ineffective. My worldview is so cynical and negative. I do not trust people I am haunted by the expressions on their faces when we talk. I believe everyone thinks I am disgusting and stupid. Everything feels so pointless. I am waking up in cold sweats from nightmares where I have put it all to rest. I am in agony and I am suffering alone. I tried to practice gratitude or search for things that might change at all for me1. A new house in a new city with exciting amenities2. Or a new job that I am passionate about3.Juggling the idea of attempting to creating new friendships so that I have a support system. 4. Perhaps going back to school to learn a new skillI may obsessively research one of these topics until I am so exhausted that I do not even have any more energy to follow through. I feel as if there is a dark presence near me stealing my energy as soon as I generate it. I feel as if there are two of me. Every time I think of an idea there is a negative side telling me that will not work. I will argue with myself for hours on end about any decision. I have tried therapy I cannot find anyone in my town who will listen to me. it is a one hour intake session followed by a half an hour meeting with a therapist before rushing me directly to a psychiatrist. I do not want to take lithium. I feel tormented. I feel alone. I am afraid. The worst pain is pain felt when you are all alone.,Depression

I just got pussy why am I so fckin empty? I am so fckin down. And now I feel like I have used someone and they do not deserve that. I miss my girl so fckin much. My mind keeps going to this picture of her laying with me eyes closed and I am just running my hand through her hair admiring how beautiful she is. Fck I miss how it felt when I kissed her. What do I do with this energy. I cannot get her back and I am left with this feeling that clearly I cannot put into someone else and be happy with it. It just sits with me waiting till I am alone so it can Fck me up. I cannot get through my head that it was not going to worl with her its like I am going through the grieving process again and I am at denial. This weighing too much on me.

I used heroin for 20 days straight no longer using to get my time without a binge tracker to 20 days and now today less than a week later even though just two hours ago I was convinced binge eating was a thing of the past I binged.

I live in a country with strict covid restrictions and we are strongly encouraged to stay home. Dining in has been restricted and I have little excuses to go out besides saying I am going to a friend's house. My friends have been gracious enough to invite me over anytime I need to but my mother would make a lot of negative comments about me leaving the house in this pandemic and it just discourages me to do thingstell her that I want to go somewhere do something. I have been receiving negative reinforcements snide remarks talking behind your back breathing down your neck parenting etc since young and this has affected me a lot as a person and I have been trying to be a better person each day. I met a guy who loved me despite everything and tried to make me a better person too he was my shelter and escape everytime my mum hits me with the negative shit. But recently he abandoned me and left me to fend for myself and he took the light away with him too. Today I signed up for a credit card and was nagged to no end by my mother and was called stupid over something that I did my research for. And it hit me that things have always been like this since I was young. Everything I do is not right and everything I do is dumb and everything I do has to be controlled by her. And I am so drained. I have not cried like today in awhile I know when it is a depressive cry. I need to leave this place and environment. I need to. Sliding back down the rabbithole,Depression

I do not want to be alone forever and I love him but still the worry keeps me up at night that one day I could wake up and it will all be gone.I just think I am too weird or anxious to make friends I feel like a loser and see mutuals posting on socials with their friends all the time makes me wonder why I cannot have that.No point to the post just a word vomit situation. Friendless,Depression
7166,I have been taking 425 mg for one week and today I started taking 850 mg. Still I am not feeling any effects beside some minor inner unrest here and there. Anyone got some experience to share? Side effects? How and to which extent did it improve your life? When did the effects kick in? Has anyone tried St. John's Wort?,Depression
7020,I am 19 male. Both of my parents where immigrants my dad died in a car accident and my mom crazy and killed herself shortly after when I was 8. My only family left was my grandma. She raised me and I fucking love her so much but she is old and has Alzheimers. Its so fucking hard seeing her drift away. I should be grateful that I was given such a loving and awesome grandma for the time she was there. I just do not know what Ill do when she forgets me. My depression has really gotten bad I do not want to take paxil because I am scared of the suicidal thoughts. Any tips? What do I even do?,Depression
7749,I am going through a tough mental week and I feel like I would be the person who randomly commits suicide. I seem happy af when I talk to friends but deep down I feel like I am dying and no one really knows or fully understands how deep it goes. Just needed to get my thoughts out of my head so thank you if you read it and I am sorry for anyone who feels the same way as I do. Horrible intrusive thoughtsa need to vent,Depression
7236,I use to be too tired to do anything but now I exercise and get motivated to do everything I need to do. Then after that I just sit back and kill time. I enjoy nothing. I just get motivated enough to finish everything then find myself with 10 hours on my off days just waiting for the day to end. Can anyone relate to this i know it is weird but. Like I feel absolutely dead inside but somehow found this motivation to kick ass. But after all the necessities I just wait for time to go by.... maybe it is because I still actually want to see how far I can go. Or maybe a hope for the future still who knows. Like it is super black and white. White as in I am motivated to kick ass. Then black as in completely dead waiting for the day to end. Also I am eating super healthy now too idk. Motivated to do what is necessary then lean back,Depression
7607,Ugh I wish I did not need medication to maintain my mood. I am so low today I do not want to do anything but I have to be a present parent. I want to not feel like a hopeless mess anymore! I want to be able to achieve my goals finally and stop allowing my brain to lose interest in them. I just want to be functional. Not going to cry. Not going to cry. Not going to cry.... Missed my Zoloft last night and now I am back in my hole today.,Depression
8992,like title this happened before a few years back when i was really depressed and stopped talking to most my friends. this time around i only had about one friend and I am pretty sure she is done with me. i do not know what to do really pretty sure i lost all my friends,Depression
9141,I hate everything about my life. I hate my job and nothing makes me happy anymore. I am ready to go. Just cannot find the courage. I think I am done.,Depression
7691,I really want to. But I do not want to hurt the few people who care about me. I do not want them to feel the way I do everyday. But I do not know how much longer I can take this. I do not have the power to continue. I do not have the power to change my life. I feel so fucking helpless and I cannot take it anymore.And the most stupid thing others have it worse! I am crying over my life but it is not even that bad. I have a roof over my head and I have food. Others do not have this and do not cry as much as me. I feel like a shitty person. I want to die.,Depression
9112,Made homemade burritos for the first time in a long time. I had it all planned out and my kitchen gets super hot so I was sweating the whole time. Only to find at the end my skillet is too shallow to strain the grease from the beef which that must have been some REALLY high fat meat. It did not dawn on me until about 5 minutes ago I could have just used a paper towel to strain off the grease.The nacho cheese sauce I decided to buy ended up overpowering my seasonings and completely overshadowed everything except the oil in the beef.So you could not taste the baby spinach the rice the tomatoes the onion nothing. Just nacho cheese sauce and oil. It was not bad but it really made me feel incompetent. You know I have been studying and studying on how to cook and season stuff properly and what seasons work well with others. Like for this it was onion powder chili powder ground cumin and salt and pepper. could not taste any of it.For the refried beans I also got some green chili sauce with lime figuring it would really jazz up the flavors in the beef as you bit down. Topped with the rice nacho cheese sauce Colby cheese shredded tomatoes and baby spinach on top to keep it away from the heat so it would not wilt and get that sort of really strong iron taste.I put a LOT of thought into this and it just ends up turning out meh. It was barely distinguishable from the likes of Taco Bell. I sweat my ass off in that kitchen and I put in all that work for that...it is depressing to me i know that may be stupid but I genuinely tried. I have got a few lessons from it though so I might try it again in the future. But for now it just kind of sits in my head and my fridge because it is just bleh Ick...,Depression
9120,First of all I am not the best Englisch writing Person and a little bit drunk. I grow up with my mom and dad til the divorce MY DAD was an ex robber drug dealer and abusive men he was always in the mood to fight somebody and break them something also he was abusive to my mother.

8832,I just completely broke down screaming crying shouting negative banter. I really think this session could have gone well if I controlled myself and analyzed my thoughts. it is been so tough these past days and I just could not take it anymore. My therapist was left speechless and could not put a word in. it is ok to have a shoulder to cry on but it is depressing knowing there is only so much they can do but listen. I just want things to be better but so much is going wrong. I am so lost. I am so confused. I am starting to have homicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. I am so angry. I have held in my anger and pain all my life and it is finally out. This is my last straw. I am on edge all the time. I just do not know what to do anymore. Therapy today was exhausting and landed me nowhere improvement wise,Depression
8668,She and I had been engaged for a few years. I got in one disagreement and Words came out wrong and I ended with her. Then we tried to resolve it and we talked again and it looked good.

8198,I have been friends with this girl since early June and I like her a lot she is not ready for a relationship which is fine. So we decided to be friends. I told her things I never told anyone. She cannot tell me certain things and does the little white lies to keep me out of certain things. I cannot stand lying even if its something tiny. So I decided that we need to take a break from a friendship for a month and I cannot stop thinking about her. After work sent her a nice hope you had a good and productive day at work . I think she blocked me all together because she has not responded at all. Now I feel like depressed and miss my friend. FML I am depressed for making a terrible decision,Depression

8254,My long term girlfriend broke up with me because she does not love me anymore apparently being depressed does not get much sympathy or help. All my friends are moving away to go to university shortly and I do not see much of then anymore. I have work but that is about it now I find no joy in that. My day just feels meaningless and I do not know what to do. I have told my mother how I feel but she says it will pass and that is it is just a break up it is more than that.

RELATIONSHIPS. FAMILY. SCHOOL. I am SORRY I cannot BE LIKE THE OTHER KIDS I am SORRY YOU do not LOVE ME. FUCK TGIS SHIT I am hopeless,Depression
9152,I guess I should start by explaining that I am 13 almost 14 and live with my abusive single mother my parents got divorced after I was born lmao.She also suffers with depression and I have seen her taking meds before. Our relationship is really rocky and she is usually really manipulative towards me.When it comes down to it I am just.. tired. I have no drive to keep living. Struggling through every single day has worn on me and now I have finally collapsed.My other friends are starting to get jobs and are talking about school while I can hardly get the strength to shower or brush my hair most days.All I have been doing is filling my days with meaningless hobbies and feeling and for myself.I feel pathetic and lazy. I know I will not be able to even start thinking about getting better for at least five more years.I do not know what I am going to do. I think I am just a lost because. will not be able to support myself.,Depression
7415,For context I am 19 years old. I do not have a job nor do I go to school. I am trying to find a job and getting my permit but it all seems in vain.I live in a toxic enviroment with my mother and my grandfather who has sexually abused me as a child. My father does not give the slightest shit and instead reminds me of how much of a burden I am every two seconds. My mother can be hella abusive to the point of ganging up against me with my grandfather.My body always feels exhausted and tired. My medications are not fucking working. I am in so much pain all of the fucking time I cannot take it anymore.My mother likes to comment on my self harm scars and insult me.I do not have any friends. Nobody gives a shit about me or my emotions. Every time I open up I get invalidated or dismissed entirely. I know its not people's job to care about me but it would be nice if someone understood me.I am so fed up with this. I just want to slit my throat the emptiness and hopelessness is becoming worse,Depression
7473,Idek where to start there is some days my thoughts be eating me alive where I cannot even eat and there is others I feel fine mostly feel like shit tho. kind of been giving up on myself no one knows how much I struggle so if I told anyone I know they would be shocked to hear but I are not telling no one fuck that I am about to keep going I guess I will never have the balls to end it all so fuck it. This shit kicking my ass wtf,Depression
9056,Does anyone else have nonstop intrusive thoughts? My brain is nothing but suicidal thoughts foggy cannot concentrate random mush running in the background. I feel extremely numb and depressed all day. I told my parents and they are extremely supportive. I would never hurt myself but how the hell are you supposed to get through this? I just feel so terrible all day and I have these nonstop intrusive urgesthoughts of suicide death etc. Its almost long random strong urges to hurt myself. Seems to be getting worse by the day. Is this fairly normal for depression? It all feels so bad I always think there is something wrong with my brain. My emotions and mood changes 100 times a day. WTF?? My brain will not SHUT THE FCK UP!,Depression
7462,I feel like my friends only talk to me because they feel bad for me but secretly hate me. These past few days have been me feeling sad and empty and i cannot fucking take it anymore. I feel like a complete burden to anybody I have ever talked to and i bet the world would be better off without me. Anyone feel the same way i do? I feel like a burden to the world.,Depression
8844,No matter how much shit has been thrown at me. No mattter the hardships which because so much pain to this day I would only want to die one way.Sacrifice myself for someone. Because at least then I can show the world that I am better than them. At least I am not a selfish being like all the others.If friends want to throw me out of their life because I am needy or I have problems fine. I do not need to stoop to that level The only way I want to go out,Depression
8005,Lately I have been having some issues with my head and my heart medically and with that I have noticed I have been more depressed. I have explained more of it on my profile about the heart and headache issues but I have been feeling down extremely. I am worried that time flies by snd before I know it I am going to be dead I am scared of growing up because of the challenges I am going to face the losses I will go through and the constant fear of getting something like cancer I am pretty young but it just feels like so much of my life has gone to waste and I am just overall scared and I want to be comfortable and I am scared of starting to become an adult and starting my life. I feel like its way to stressful and lifes going to be over before I know it because it seems like everybody around me is getting cancer and everything and I am hearing about people dying on the news and I do not want that to be me. I do not know how to stay positive and enjoy life so what I am basically saying is i hate waiting for death. I just want to enjoy life what can I do? My doctor wants to prescribe me with anxiety medication because she noticed that its horrible btw. I just want to feel happy and normal and enjoy life. I am struggling and I really need help.,Depression

8585,Well guys I need some help. Like I am seeing a licensed therapist but thru talkspace as I cannot afford any therapy in my town...and I do not have a car due to anxiety. Well this therapist is new to me but before I came to her I was looking into short term disability. And before I thought that maybe I could just tough it out. I am one to kind of push on through. I think that because of my flair for the dramatics I do tend to downplay and gaslight the fuck out of myself when I am depressed. When I lost a job opportunity it got bad. I relapsed and started SH again. Which is something I do not like about myself. I was clean for about three months but lately my job has been really hard on me. We started with 50 workers in my position there are now 8 left....only 7 months later. I have even gone as far as nearly getting into an accident as a passenger and being disappointed I came out unscathed. I wished something would happen. I do not enjoy weekends because I know I am going back. And the people I speak with are lovely but I am incapable of thinking straight and you know when you are just getting BAD again. And I have no idea what I am supposed to do. My therapist said I would qualify I have to talk to my pcp about it but I feel so guilty. Everytime I get on the phone to talk to someone about it I burst into tears. it is so humiliating to know they have got me crying for an hour recorded begging them to just Bear with me I never do this. I am so sorry I do not know why I am crying! I just need help. How did you get the STD approved? What should I expect? Please please no negativity. Taking a leave at 23 when I am otherwise in good health is truthfully so humiliating and saddening. I feel bad enough. Claiming Short Term Disability for work. TW SH suicidal ideation,Depression
7095,Hey so this morning I was focused on doing my life coach training etc and was tagged in a story on fb about another person who is life has been flipped upsidedown since being vex jabby day.I noticed she had thousands of responses to her story. But I have had less than 15.This knocked me off the motivation train. As I have been struggling alot with motivation these last few weeks as I feel tired and just sleep all the time. So given I am not in a good head space it has left me feeling bumbed out.Guess years of being in the mindset I do not want to be seen offgrid is paying off. Since recently decided to get my story out there to connect with other people who have gone through similar situation. To not feel so alone and isolated.Do you get this?? Does anyone understand?? Motivation Train,Depression
8144,did anyone else develop a stutter from being depressed what did you do to help you get out of it? how do you deal with the stutters?,Depression
8492,I have had severe seasonal depression over the last three years and this year this winter it did not appear so I thought that I beat it. But last week I had a feeling that reminded me of the nightmare that I thought was over. And it came back 10x stronger. I was completely fine. Even adderall was not able to help or clear my mind of this fog. I am really really afraid because this time I will not be able to fight it or to wait for it to clear. I just need hope i want to go backnot everyting was perfect before but this complete ego death no self worth weakness brain fog is just unbearable. Also I am still using my meds as I was in the depressed state zoloft adderallvery low dose and quetiapinealso low Please tell me it is not comming back,Depression
7189,my body has not been able to sleep. my mind has not been able to rest. I am tired of everything. I am tired of living.i force myself to do everything. life feels wrong all of the time.47 year old human in 2021 that simply feels done. tired of living,Depression
7845,I am trying to get back to normal. I am trying to get out of bed. I am trying to be happy. I am trying to find another point of view besides feeling disappointed when I wake up the next morning. I am trying to stop hating every second of this pitiful excuse of a life. I understand you are tired of hearing that I am trying. But if I do not try one more time then Id have nothing left keeping me here. I am out of reasons to keep me here. I feel like I am caped in this hollow body of a girl I used to remember. Every time I look in the mirror I am reminded just how broken I am. I see her face and remember how happy she used to be. I remember how full of life she was. She was a ray of light and sunshine and I am reminded how dark and empty her eyes now are. Her sleepless nights are leaving their trail under her eyes. The loss of appetite has diminished her wardrobe all the clothes she used to love to wear now fall off her body. I am reminded she is empty and the walls are caving in. The walls in this body get smaller and smaller I cannot breath I feel like I am suffocating and no one even understands. I am right here dying slowly and you cannot even see. This is a torturous cycle and I do not think I can try anymore. I am so tired. I am Trying,Depression
8875,I have dealt with depression pretty much my whole life I am 34 now. let us get some basics out of the way single manager at an office for a bank short enough to be self conscious about it and just getting sober from weed.I am trying to clean the house because mom is visiting soon but damn I can barely do anything because nothing at this moment seems worth it. that is a familiar feeling but it is hitting hard. I know I will work tomorrow but when I am done... maybe exercise that is not a big deal to me it is more of a habit now anyways but otherwise I just cannot function.I was supposed to be productive because weed was making me guilty for not improving my life which needs it... but now I am not doing anything and I am completely sober. That depression is hitting hard again and I am trying to not numb it. I cannot say weed is a factor here but I am thinking it is definitely one of them. Now I am feeling guilty again but without the substance to block it out. I will not go back to drinking casually by myself thank you green for helping I admit that but... shit man. Quitting green should not be this hard. I have cold turkey addy abuse before and even then I was getting brain shocks from that but those have ceased long ago thankfully. Scary shit.I cannot get out of my head that my 34 year old life can be fixed. I compare myself to everyone and just talk myself down about it to a terrible fault but I just want to be happy and achieve my goals. Now I am back to scratching that spot on my head dreading tomorrow.it is not like I am stupid... in some sense. Got the degree yup psych dropped out of grad school got a real estate license and personal training cert basically on a whim both expired because I hate the selling. So I start and give up rather easily. My dream is to become an author. I know overdone but I cannot help it I enjoy making a world and spooky stories and that is what makes it a dream to at least live off that. Whenever I get someone to read something I feel like I am forcing them to give me compliments so now I have not touched my laptop except for paying bills in almost a year. I cannot continue this life in this state. In this state of having customers yell at me over the phone constantly beating myself up and knowing that tomorrow I will not be able to improve. I would appreciate some input or something nice? Ha. I am sure if you are reading this you have an idea of why I am writing this. But it is not healthy. I take 20mg fluoxetine but I cannot feel it. When I went up 40mg I felt terrible so that is was not good. Anyways thank you for letting me get this out. I cannot convince myself that my life will get better and that is making me believe nothing is worth trying.,Depression
7965,If COVID is our future I do not want to be a part of it. I cannot handle another 2020. Everyone already hates me and I wish I was dead I wish I was dead,Depression
8912,I am a 17f Lately I have been feeling more and more depressed I look back at my old self and how I used to be when I was younger. I used to be filled with life and always hang out with friends I had a good relationship with my family I would say that that was probably the best part of my life so far sadlyI cannot even look at myself in the mirror I always avoid mirrors because I hate myself.Coming from a mexican household my mother does not believe in mental health problems. She always says you have food clothes and a roof over your head! Why are you sad? You should be grateful for all the things you have.My parents are divorced I have 3 siblings but the oldest left to live on their own. My oldest brother had a huge argument with my mom and they have not spokenseen each other for four years. I also have a 2nd oldest brother who has Autism he is also mute and he pretty much needs help with everything. he is pretty calm and does not look like he has special needs but he makes noises which annoys me and I feel bad for being embarrassedannoyed with him. Right now I am living in an apartment with my mother and Autistic brother. My mom has to work 247 so that means that I have to look after my brother which feels like a full time job. I can never go out without bringing him along because I cannot leave him alone I am already embarrassed by him so I cannot even go out. I feel like even if I wanted to move out I could not because I have no money and I have no opportunity to go and make money for myself. My father is also pretty absent in my lifeI also have no friends because my best friend of 8 years and my friend group decides to exclude me out. I was bullied by them my sophomore year.I feel like I am stuck everyday is the same. I do not see a reason that I should keep waking up everyday. I am not pretty or skinny so that does not help either. I just want to pause my life and breathe and to go be able to do the things I want to do but I cannot. I imagine that I will be my brother's guardian once my mom passes away. she is healthy now but I do not want to be responsible for him but I do at the same time because I feel bad. Idk I do not feel so bad anymore now that I typed out my feelings Stuck,Depression
7010,Yeah this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before as I know you all have too but even in those deepest depressive periods I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure one way or another I am depressed. This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression other mood disorders and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and selfdeprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line nearish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is depression? I invite you to share your information and opinions.,Depression
7221,Men lying to me and manipulating me people stealing from me the people that are supposed to care about me disregarding my issues and using me. Random people on the street disrespecting me.I was feeling depressed about it first but its transitioned to rage. I am starting to feel insane. I feel like everyone is attacking my wellbeing and my lively hood and all I want to do is really fight back.But the way I want to fight back is not accepted in society. Please give me advice on what I can do to soften the blows? I know I cannot walk thru life completely alone but I am seconds away from snapping and ending up in a really fucked up situation or really dead. I feel like I am under attack.,Depression
7114,Everything that makes life supposedly great is not available to me. I could never get a girl and could never end up making friends despite me trying and I have never had money and no one hires me despite me applying to places for over a year! Life is so unfair No girlfriend No friends No money,Depression

I feel great ambitious I want to buy some sht that will progress me in the things I like. then it fades I have no pleasure and the deep depressive cavity hits for the rest of the day.ampx200Bis this a normal phenomenon? is there a term for sort of phenomenon when you wake up feel good then it hits a brick sht wall?,Depression
7969,I am trying to get into MtG because my partner is into it and I want to do things that they like but the game makes me so sad for some reason. Like I bought a bulk box and I just got a bunch of common boring cards and I cannot stop crying over it?? I wanted really cool cards like my partner has and it is just all junky cards and I feel so let down.This caused a fight with my partner because I was being extremely negative. we have been having a lot of fights recently that are always caused by my negativity. It just gets really bad at night. I do not know. I am sick of crying and I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow and I might just not go. I feel too shitty to do anything. I have been crying over magic cards on and off all day,Depression
8866,I do not amount to anything. I struggle to find meaning for my existence. I want to do something but i am to weak. I feel hopeless. I am just leeching off life and not doing anything. It is like i was born to suffer. People always expect me to be happy for what i have but what is it worth if i do not make myself do anything with it? I feel like everyone is better than me and i hate it. I also hate that i might deserve this suffering. Some people just except that life is like that and they were born that way but it angers me.why me? I feel like skeletal remains of my past potential and i will continue to regret and never stop. Why am i so useless,Depression
7927,I honestly cannot remember what being happy feels like anymore . it is like I go a couple weeks feeling like I am happy and then it all breaks down and I realise it was just a masqueradeand I have been miserable the whole time. I do not know if I will ever be happy again. it sure as hell does not feel like it. Happy?,Depression
8631,I wake up at noon after going to bed at 1am because I am tired but i just cannot seem to fall asleep. I lay on the bed tirelessly until 4 or 5am and finally sleep takes me. I spend 12 hours in bed sleeping badly and i wake up feeling like I have been hit by a truck. I am constantly tired all day. I have been studying for an exam for the past 2 weeks but i just cannot seem to learn anything i keep going back to things i should have memorized by now but i keep forgetting. Because of this i feel worthless and i just do not have the drive to keep on going I am considering dropping out of college i just feel empty and i cannot seem to do anything right. I am always staring at a computer screen or with my neck down on the books i have constant headaches that go away only when i take a day or two of pause from my studies but whenever i do so i have constant anxiety because i feel like I am wasting time and i should be doing something productive. I am feeling so apathetic i cannot enjoy anything anymore i cannot even start a new book or even a movie i spend literally all my free time watching dumb videos on youtube that i ignore anyway since I am always staring into the void thinking about all the time I am wasting. Just writing this post is filling me with guilt since I am taking time away from my studies but i know that the moment i go back to them I am going to be miserable again. I have no energy to do anything,Depression
7693,He sits aloneIn darkness he swellsNo place like home.His eyes are wetHis lips are crookedNo need to fret.Mental paintings which hungNow lay dust covered.Words which used to flow like waterHave now dried. he is tired. He feels alone. That which used to helpNo longer supplies. These words mean nothing.He thinks to himself.They do not help.They do not soothe.So hell retire from his ink stained desk.And ask what is my worth? I have thought this since birth.if i can even walk this earthBlissful waves no doubt id surf. But what is the point If i do not even know my own worth.Shit am i even worth this shirt? Looking at you like would you anoint? But fuck it ill probably disappoint youCause there is nothing i would not do to get a piece of that joint too. Becausewhat you be smoking Is thought provoking and invoking that serious Notion that were all alone andStoned in some overgrownUnknown overthrown Place of which we used to call home. But if i would have known my path all these obstacles in my way Then I would have became an osteopath. Twisting my skeleton To dodge duck and dip this infrastructurejust to rupture in this undefined culture of vultures. But enough of that kind of talk When i try to mix these words together All i hear is squawk squawkThats what is in my mind Because when its inclined and combined I can reach for and bind what i find To assign to a piece of paper and remindUs all of what its like to be kind to one another.Discover what life is like under no blufferAnd try to realize you too can find a lover.A lover who may not be under the coversBut smothered inside yourself. Look i just dropped that bombshell So please take your mind from off that shelf Dust it off put it in. good now does not that help? Sad Artist what is my worth,Depression
9104,Can you share what your indicators are that an episode is coming? Can you feel when a depressive episode is coming on? Is it gradual or sudden for you usually?,Depression
8943,The title says it all really. My Sister just said Ill be a worthless piece of shit for the rest of my life all because I do not have a girlfriend,Depression
7482,I am just fed up of everything. Everything and everyone pisses me off and I have tried to be happy but that just does not work. I have made plans of suicide for sometime after i pass my driving test and get a car. Its the only thing i can think of I have tried self harm but I am too scared of pain thought about jumping off a building like my brother tried but I am a coward and anything else is too painful or I am scared to do it. I know I have not passed my gcses because i did not try so I probably will not be able to get into college I am so negative to everyone around me I am scared I am losing friends. Everything about me is just a fucking waste anyone else could have been born in my place and done better children are dying in impoverished countries who could have had great potential but people like me were born who are selfish and useless. I do not know what to title this,Depression
7994,I wish I had died last year.I could not create anything today. I could barely sing. I feel like when quarantine began I was meant to kill myself. Oh my God I actually regret not killing myself last year.I exercised a little showered sightread piano music for literally 10 minutes sang for about 30 seconds until I hated my voice and cuddled with my cat. Right when I started singing I thought about how much I just want to stop doing anything anyone wants me to do. I do not want to sing. I do not want to be complimented. I do not want to be in a world full of people who wish the best for me and always want me to become something great when all I want to do is die.I am not looking forward to anything. I am not even learning the script for my friends play yet because I simply want to do nothing. I want to dissolve. I want to evaporate. I think about being dead and I feel so happy. TW I am very very sad,Depression
8779,My father is a real macho guy and he thinks mentally ill people are just lazy and giving poor excuses. So he definitely cannot understand what I am going through. But today he went away to meet his mothermy grandmother and I can talk alone with my mother. But the problem is I have told her about my mental health before. It was probably a year ago and sheampfather said it is because you stay indoors all day go out and exercise and all the usual shit. So since than I just stayed silent at home. I know today is the best day to talk about it but I just cannot do it. it is at least 5 years since I was depressed and I could not gather up my courage when I was younger. So how am I supposed to do that? I know what I have to do but I do not know if I have the strength to do it.,Depression
8343,Does anyone else feel like you are never going to be happy? I have been depressed most of my life over the last year and half I have been on an antidepressant. Its helped my anxiety but I am not necessarily happy just numb. Is this as good as it gets? I was talking to my doctor earlier trying to explain to him that I do not feel good and I have not for a long time and maybe we should switch antidepressants because I do not think this one is helping and causing weight gain fatigue exhaustion etc and he was just like nope you are fine and completely ignored my concerns. Does it ever get better or am I just destined to be miserable for the rest of my life Worried I am never going to be happy,Depression
7967,When i finally fall asleep I want my heart to stop beating . I do not care anymore. I do not recognise myself. I am finished I hope I never wake up,Depression
6986,To me its all I think about when I think about what I lost its just a matter of when and how at this point. I have never felt that I want to do it this much before,Depression
9062,My emotions or lack of scare me. Over the past couple of months I have noticed that I just seem to care less and less. Literally anything could happen to me or around me and I do not know why but nothing seems to make me feel normal emotions. Two events made me super aware of my new emotional numbness. A couple months ago I got into a bad accident with my mother and she was freaking out and crying and I just sat there. I was not scared or sad or in shock. I was sitting in a wrecked car ready to continue the trip and move on to the next destination. Then the other time was when my dad was mad at me for something and he yelled at me and told me how disappointed he was and I again just sat there staring at him. Even after he left I just sat there then continued on with what I was doing. I feel like maybe I might be going crazy because of how numb I am sometimes. But at the same time I like being numb because I do not like having to feel. I struggle to have emotions sometimes a little rant,Depression
8905,Its not easy wearing a mask all the time. Sometimes I carry it well other times I cannot even find the strength to put it on. Everything is fine as long as I wear it but the minute it starts to slip I am no fun to be around I cannot even open up about the way I truly feel because nobody really understands. I do not enjoy doing anything. Literally. I am just on autopilot in a constant state of numbness. Its like I am just a ball and chain for my wife to carry around. Of course she is tired of it who would not be. She does not understand the constant pain I am in. She does not understand that she is the only reason I am even keeping on going. Opening up to her just causes her pain because I know she just wants me to be happy with her. The thing is though I would not be anywhere as happy as I am now without her. she is my world. I just do not know what to do. I feel guilty for her having to be around me like this. I feel like I have to wear a mask all the time,Depression
7759,I want to make some things clear first. English is not my native language I am not from Englishspeaking country so I apologise if you find harsh mistakes in my post or if I mention something inappropriate for this particular community or in general if it is something really important please let me know and I will fix it. Also my username was suggested by Reddit.As it says in the title I am a 21 years old male. I have been living with my grandparents basically since I was born. The desicion that I would live with them instead of my mother was obviously made when I was not really conscious about it. I still have my mother but I do not want to live with her and she does not express a will for that either not that I would take this offer. I do not even want to talk with this person.With these things said I am moving to the problems I have. Now I will mention the ones that while still affecting me in a negative matter I do not see as primary but rather as secondary. Saying that I mean that I can live with them or even try to deal with them in my future by myself. They are here just for a bigger picture not much else.1. I 100 have extreme social anxiety. This is why I was not able to continue my study in university. Well not only this actually but also because it was not free and also I did not see any perspectives with my anxiety working a job that would require any social interaction which means any job outside of the Internet. I found a way around it so this is dealt with. I just have to study for it and I should have some possible income in future working online.2. I have zero friends. Like absolutely no one even online. It makes things harder but I learned to accept it and now I think I do not even need them. But that is why I am writing my problems here.3. I do not think a therapist will help me. As I continue I think you will understand why I think like that.And moving on here is the primary problem I would like to receive an advice onI am afraid that I HAVE to live with my grandparents for the rest of THEIR lives. I am the only person living with them right now and all the people from my family have their own little 'families'. The reason because I think they would not be able to normally live on on their own is because of their problems. My grandfather drinks alcohol every month for 12 weeks straight and of course this causes stress for the whole family but no one is able to fix it mostly for my grandmother. She has a form of cancer having which life can be sustained mostly without the need of hospitalisation though she still needs to be in a hospital every 34 weeks for a week. You could notice the similarity between times when my grandfather drinks and my grandmother goes to hospital but I have to tell you these facts do not have much to do with each other he was drinking all the time before my grandmother was revealed to have cancer anyways. Well hearing all that I do not seem to be a good person right? Like being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? Yes and I do not feel like I am a good person either. I do not want to blame everything on the others my fault is also big here.I did not have a bad childhood. Neither a good one. I do not remember much of it even being only three years out of it. But there is not a single good thing I remember from it only bad and embarassing things. My grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me I feel like I was raised by myself. Just providing me with food and roof until I magically become an adult. And I did not ask them for anything either I did not even have a smartphone before I entered university when it became a nessecity. Graduating from school I thought I would kill myself but I did not. It was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. Thinking back on that it was pretty comforting not trying to improve anything in your life thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.Yes I am an egoist. I want to live by myself for myself alone. In a crappy apartment with no real life contacts working online and only going outside to buy food. I would even be fine if I had to give 50 of my income to my family if the other 50 can pay me for rent and food. I am sure I would be happy this way. What is there no place for egoists in our society? Do I have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? Or is this just me being depressed about my life who does not understand other people who are not depressed. Like what THESE people are living for?The moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. My grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. I think I was listeting to music that moment not really loud I can understand now why I am not listeting to music at higher volume it is the moments like this. And my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. The only thing I said to her was that I would hear her if she was screaming. This was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several MONTHS. I feel like I do not have a single minute to relax I am always stressed because something like this can happen and I always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. Like I feel that if I just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace I would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. But I cannot do that. I did not make an impression of being such a person. I act like I am fine and everything is fine. Not that someone actually cares if I am fine or not.You think if I am saying all that I actually did consider asking them if I can move out in future or not. I did not. I am afraid to. But I think that they will that I can. What will happen then? Currently I am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and I did a lot of work there by myself. Her health is progressively worsening and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. So the things are going to get even worse without me being around.I would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. Can I be that person? What should I do? I ask these questions mostly to myself but if you read that far into my post I would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. Thanks. 21M and need an advice,Depression
7806,Context I do not remember the last time I brushed my teeth properly. I know I need to go to the dentist because cold things and sweet things hurt and there is a patch on two of my front teeth that I am guessing is whatever is under the enamel BC it hurts to touch hurts to brush etc so I stopped. However I am so fucking terrified of going to the dentist because I do not want them to judge me. it is also my family dentist and I am scared they will accidentally say something to my family. I know it is likely going to be expensive and for all I am currently unemployed thanks covid idk how much is going to be free if any. They make me feel so self conscious and I want to fix that and sort them out but I am just so scared. How do you build up the courage to do something?,Depression
7977,My mom keep telling me to smilewhen she emotionally abused me every day. Make me want to smile or no! I am not going to smile at you. Smile is not something you ask for. You have to earn it. Stop telling me to smile !,Depression
7315,Moved high schools when the whole pandemic thing was at its worst. due to restrictions it made it very hard to make friends. slipped deeper into my depression and now I am just so lonely and its so embarrassing eating lunch alone. i am dreading next school year so much as with restrictions lifted it will be even more apparent I am a loner. i wish this was just a bad dream and i was happy Having no friends sucks so much.,Depression
7216,I just want to know if anyones life has ever gotten better from a point where they attempted to commit sicide. I have tried once and held on to the hope that eventually hopefully my life would get better it never did even years later. Ill probably try therapy to see if that changes anything. I am that annoying bubbly happy outgoing person everyone hates but no one ever thinks about. When I was in elementary and middle school doctors diagnosis me with depression social anxiety anxiety Does life ever get better? I feel like I have been asking myself that question since I was 7 now I am 23.,Depression
8158,Guys I want your sincere opinions I got diagnosed recently and I tought I should tell my mom only her since she is the closest family member and I was hoping that she could help me a bit or at least not make things harder. But when I tried to tell her she started making jokes about it. She does not seem like she cares much.it is really hard to sit down and have a conversation with her. So is it better if I keep going by myself ooooor should I try and tell her? Is it a good idea to tell my mom about my depression?,Depression
8530,My depression is only getting worse. I feel like everyone in my life has given up on me and I think I have given up on me too. I wish I had the guts to just end my life right now. So sick and tired of living,Depression
8567,I do not know if this is the place. I just do not know what to do. I am 23 and I am just not into life. I am always feeling this feeling which kind of just makes youthink. I just sit there. I wake up at 6am turn off my 8am alarm and just lie on my side hunched up thinking about the past. I feel paralysed all the time whenever someone has a go at me whenever I fuck up the tiniest bit at work. I do not even know what I want to do in my life I am just buying random shit to fill the space like a new project car and shit parts for it. All I do is work go home on the weekend go home on Monday run out of money and work some more. I live at work because of my job. So there is just no escaping it. I finish work and I think about work. And when it gets too much I drink 700ml rum and take 120mg of codeine in the home that il fall asleep. I have to work from home rn and I just cannot do it without staring hopelessly paralysed at my computer screen thinking about why and how I have got this depressed. I was an alcoholic when I met my girlfriend drinking 1.5l of whiskey rum or whatever the fuck I felt like drinking that night. When I go for a drive and suddenly it hits I just sink into the accelerator and by the time I know it I am doing 130mph on the M5 home. I just do not know what to do with myself. I want to promote in my job but I fucking hate my job. I am in it for the money that is it. Because rent is too much and life is too expensive. I am just about ready to suck some fucking Nitrogen and stop breathing. Just if it means I can stop thinking like this and constantly living with stress anxiety and feeling like i am a total waste of oxygen in this snowflake society. I do not know man. What do I do crack open another bottle? Just writing.,Depression
8153,Sick of it all. No clue what to do seems like the only option. Shit does not get better matter of fact it only gets worse fuck this Never thought about suicide this much in my life,Depression
8349,I have been hearing this for as long as i can remember and have not seen any improvement. the goal posts keep moving. why do people give fake hope? why does everyone say it gets better?,Depression
9051,I am a mental health nurse. I should be strong and healthy. But I am not coping. I do not think I have anything else to give. One of my patients told me she was jealous of my happyness. Iv gotten so good a faking it. I have no happiness left but I am too terrified of anyone finding out.I over think everything and everyone. I hate myself. Everything about myself. I need help but I am too embarrassed to go. Then I hate myself more and feel ashamed of how pathetic I am.I have alopecia that started from a particularly bad year. A break up and broken nose from a patient amongst other things.I am tired. I want to see people and I want to be alone. I feel bad whatever I do.I am so tired. I do not think I can cope.,Depression
8702,i my dad meant well by sending me this he just wants me to get better and be happier but it made me feel 10000x more misunderstood and 10000x worse it was an ig post of a quote from paul walker someone in the hospital is begging god for opportunity you have. do not you dare go to bed depressed. count your blessings and shake it offwish it was that easy guilt,Depression
7586,i was doing okay. i spent years trying everything i could to overcome my depression and anxiety and all that. i was doing okay. my grandfather got into a bad accident and was put into the hospital about a month ago. from then on things kept getting worse. two different kinds of cancer found and now he is not going to be getting better. I am so fucking scared. he is one of the most important people in my life and my rock. we have always had such a close bond. I am in college and a really fucking expensive one at that. I am struggling. these last few days after finding out hes in hospice have been so hard. I am so incredibly depressed anxious and scared all the time. i cannot sleep. I am never sober. i have at least one intense panic attack a day and i fucking cry all day for hours. i cannot focus on my work and i cannot drop out of class because its a one shot deal sort of thing and i want to make my dad and myself proud. he saved the money up for 20 fucking years. i was passionate about this. i feel like my life is falling apart. there are other things contributing to my state right now but my dear grandfather and severe lack of motivation is the most intense. I am so lost. my therapist the only one i can afford and have a bond with has been unable to work for months due to an unexpected emergency surgery. i do not know. i do not know what to do. I am so sad and scared. i keep disconnecting from my body completely and i cannot work at all. I am on the fuckingbrink of failure and i cannot afford to redo this class if i fail. i know this is very ranty but I am constantly freaking out and putting this out there is all i can think to do right now i do not know what to do right now,Depression
8486,I have no right to be depressed. Over the past decade I have fixed my life mostly. I went to college got my degree got a great job with fantastic coworkers... But that does not take away from the fact that I did in my 40s what I should have done in my 20s.I am looking back at a wasted life and seeing things that I will never achieve now. Getting married? Having kids? Pft... I did not do it in the past because I was not going to subject anybody to the immature shitshow that was my life and I am not doing it now because I do not want to subject anybody to the immature depression that is my life. My meds are helping me to not break down crying on a regular basis but they do not take away the hard truth that my life is almost over and it was wasted.Starting my life so late is also putting me in the wrong peer group. The friends that I had from high school until my mid40s are no longer a part of my life. Right now my very best friend is nearly half my age. All of my coworkers are also young Millennials. Some are even Gen Z. My belief structures are more Millennial than Gen X as are my interests. I am currently watching Avatar and Shera for fucks' sake. Funny thing? I am not suicidal. I have a crippling fear of death. Nonexistence just scares the hell out of me. I just want more time... Or to take back what I wasted. My coworkers accept me and include me in their social lives but I cannot help but think that I am just some creepy old guy hanging out with kids... Kids in their midtolate 20s but still. We get along our interests are the same... But I do not belong. Then again I also do not belong with most of Gen X either. I am just a fucking mess right now and need to vent. Sorry for wasting your time I am turning 50 in a few days and I am depressed as f about how I have wasted my life,Depression
7355,I am so sleep deprived since I am literally addicted to my phone. Its 5 am right now and I am really tired but my mind just tells me to stay awake since I kind of enjoy it and I do not want the day to come. Its become really bad I stay up till at least 4 everyday for no reason and I wake up way too late and cannot function normally. I know I can just put my phone away but still I need help,Depression
8649,Since it is quarantine summer break I ended up feeling miserable my room is messy I feel too lazy to shower I often feel bored I try to balance my diet but I end up regretting with eating some pasta I did not exercise for months I do not practice my hobbies anymore I feel so sad and out of control I just want to die .The life of a student during summer break while having a panademic. Summer break and quarantine,Depression
8345,All I want is to fall in love and have a happy life with someone. I do not want items or wealth really. A stable living sure but no extravagance needed. Literally all I want is for someone to love me how I want to be loved. I have been in four major relationships and they have all been SO amazing. No drug on the earth has felt so good. But I have ruined every one of them. Its like I cannot even control myself. The narcissism runs so deep I do not know what I have even done or said until I sleep and when I wake up I feel like an absolute pos. And eventually the apologies run thin and finally they leave. I do not want to be this way. But I always have been. I hate myself so much. I am 30 now and felt like this last woman was the one. she is now gone too. I am in such a deep hole. I just cry randomly throughout the day. I cannot be alone but no one wants to be with me after a year of dating usually. I think I am hopeless and really want to just blow my head off. I really want to die but I am too addicted to the highs to let go,Depression
8013,I really want to get help. I want to confide in someone but I am too hung up on the thought that they would take on my issues as well. I have always had the mindset that issues are personal something that you deal with alone. You could tell me that is not true but I just subconsciously act fake in front of people. I mask my feelings without even noticing that I am doing it. My last therapist did not work for me because I was not even being real with her. I would keep smiling and I would get extremely uncomfortable when opening up so I would barely say anything about myself or my problems. I only realize this looking back on it now. Hell we even talked about the weather for a whole session once. I know that its horrible but I do not know how to stop. After a recent breakdown I realized that I do this with everyone I know. Even with my closest friends and family. So I am basically isolating myself without even trying. How fucking crazy is that? Depression is weird man. Stuck,Depression
7982,I am on the younger side for this. But last year I lost my cousin to suicide. I had been contemplating it myself but the pain it caused for me and my family I knew I could do it. So I am stuck I feel great most days but some I just cannot do anything. Right after he died I used nicotine to cope and I still do but I feel so lost. Its hard to talk to people close about. I have talked to people before but I have had it thrown back in my face. So I do not feel very trusting anymore. But in the end Ill live through live with such pain not knowing what to do it where to go I just feel beyond the point of redemption. I cannot keep strong for others forever but Ill hold as long as possible. If you did thank you for reading Ill most likely reply if anyone has something to say. LK Losing someone has me lost.,Depression
7233,I am a 15 year old kid and I have been struggling with what i believe is depression. I have so many trust issues with relationships and friendships i hate the way my body looks even though I am working out to try and fix it but sometimes it just feels futile. My friends hate me the reason i think this is because my one friend group they all make fun of me call me unfunny annoying and one dude in there always call me an emo depressed kid who should just kill himself. I really only have my mom and a couple of friends but i feel so embarrassed to tell them how i feel. My dad is a horrible father and contributes to how lonely and out of place i feel. And a couple weeks ago i went to my friends birthday party and me him and his friends smoked weed and it was the first time for me and for once in my life i actually felt something. I have been craving that high ever since but idk who i should ask to buy edibles off of or if i should even do it. i have not tried self harm nor do i want to because i know once i go down that road ill cross the line and i do not know if ill be able to come back from that. I need advice on what to do.,Depression
8670,So I have had suicidal ideation come and go for the past few years it can be pretty scary but I manage to pull through. I talked to a few of my friends about it recently none of them have any diagnosed mental health problem yet they admit that from time to time they have suicidal thoughts so my question is what percent of people with suicidal ideation actually commit suicide? What percent of people with suicidal ideation actually commit suicide?,Depression
7937,I have been battling The Big Sad for about 15 years now and I thought I was doing better. I stopped self harming I had overall happier thoughts and did not even really want to die anymore. But lately my suicide thoughts have gone from bone to passive to aggressive. I have been lying to everyone about how I feel just so they do not have to deal with the burden of it I bought knife blades for the first time in almost a year for the sole purpose of using on myself just to feel SOMETHING!! I know my life is falling apart and I do not really feel like there is anything I can do about it. Almost every shower I have I come out of it with a new mark on my body. Almost every thought is how swiftly I can disappear and make sure no one acknowledges it. I do not know what to do or even what I want. I feel like my identity has been stripped away by depression. I have been a bad person,Depression
8592,As the title says I am feeling so lost it happens every so often maybe every few months or so. Like I just loose all motivation and it feels like I am in a state of trance and I just cannot bring myself out of it. I cannot feel joy and gets overwhelmed with the feeling of boredom. I starts to cry randomly even if I do not think of anything. it is just the worst feeling in the world to me. No doubt anyone will read this and that is fine it was just me thinking out loud and kind of hoping it would make more sense if I write it down maybe help pull myself out of it or something. It did not really so I will just drink and wait it out I guess. Feeling so Lost,Depression
8930,I have not had energy to smile since i cannot remember when. I am sad. I am depressed and have no reason to get out of bed in the mornings other than my 2 girls. They are the only reasons I do anything. I am scared I have dealt with depression my whole life but this feels different and scary and permanent and I am not so sure how to deal with it all. I have effectively cut all my friends out of my life. I have not responded to any texts from any friends other than kid related texts in months. I would never leave my house if i did not have to go to work or take my kids places. I do not even have enough feelings to cry anymore. But I do not even know how to be honest with my therapist bc I am too scared of outside humans realizing I do not have my life together. How do I even start. I have not shared my feelings honestly for so many decades the ability has atrophied. How do I even begin to be honest? I get so scared that I worry that I am either making up how I feel or maybe how I feel is what I think I am supposed to feel or what I know I am supposed to say to check off the boxes of being okay. I do not even recognize my own truth. How in the world am I supposed to fix this? I do not even know how to recognize my own truth,Depression
7922,Since a child I have always neglected food. I am in my 20s m and was hoping Id grow out of it by now. I am quite thin and forget to eat regularly. I tell people I have eaten when I have not sometimes I buy food just to satisfy others and secretly throw it out. My stomach always aches and hurts I am not sure if its the lack of food or what is stopping me from eating I think both. It kills me to see my family and friends who constantly offer me food. Anyways I have been to over 10 specialists doctors probably more like 20 honestly and spent over 5k trying to get help but cannot seem to get over this. I think its partly medical and mentally related. Anyways rant over thanks. Any advice greatly appreciated and yes I have tried medicinal cannabis and lots of pharmacy meds. Body,Depression
8099,honestly i do not really know what i want to get out of this. its just everyone says that its good to tell someone about what you are feeling. but I am not sure how my mum will react and I am kind of scared.my suicidal thoughts come and go because i keep telling myself things will turn out okay. when bad things happen i want to die. and then the problem gets solved and i will think that i was being overly dramatic for wanting to die. but then another problem arise and i think of dying again. it keeps happening and I am tired of being trapped in the cycle. it feels like people would not take me seriously if i tell them about this because it seems like I am just a simple minded child who cannot handle problems and thinks that death is the escape.but i do not know how else to get out of it. its not like i want to be suicidal i just cannot control these thoughts. if my mum does not care i would not know what to do anymore. thinking of telling my mum about my suicidal thoughts,Depression
7300,my brother has not spoken to our mother in over 10 years and he just started speakingtexting to me again after ghosting me for 3 years. I was listening to music and a song came on that always made me think of our family situation. I did not think he would even listen or reply but he did and he sent me back a song that must have been on his heart with the situation and knowing that is how he feels breaks my heart. Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big strong charismatic athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way. No tears or screaming..just brokenness. I have recovered from my childhood very well considering. However that small interaction with my brother the other day has really brought back a lot of feelings. I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5yo he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone. Me on the other hand feels like in order for me to be okay i need to hug my brother and tell him i love him and see him be an uncle to my baby so basically I have been crying since monday and thinking about how i do have unresolved anger towards our mom and maybe i need to talk to her about how i feel but I have felt fine with everything for awhile until finding out how hurt my brother still is a vent post triggering convo w brother,Depression
8606,Fuck this world fuck 99 of the people in it let us hope everything burns and falls apart because this bullshit notion that there is kindness and quality is absolute horseshit.I am tired of people say be kind and the universe will reciprocate none of that is true you have to be a terrible person who does terrible things in order to get ahead. Forget about being a quality human being there never was such a thing. People need to start doing negative actions in order to rectify all the wrongs going on. You are not in control of anything and instead are just a pawn in a bullshit mirage of happiness. There is no point in helping anyone there is no point in doing anything positive except for animals who cannot help themselves. People are fucking disgusting and I have zero empathy or sympathy for any being anymore. Millions suffer from depression and sadness and nothing is changing. In order to change anything be a nasty person and take what you can because that is how happy people live. Be evil like a Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates lie about having a good exterior and ravage everything you can because nothing good comes from being a good person. Drop the anxiety ravage what you can this place is a dump for anger and terror. The time for empathy is gone fuck this world and fuck anyone who says you have to fight for goodness. There is no goodness only shit people saying shitty things. Fuck money fuck owning a home fuck going to the movies fuck listening to music fuck an education fuck helpless people because there is no helping them. Fuck it all and I hope the world burns today not tomorrow not next week fucking burn today. Fuck being good or kind its all a mirage.,Depression
6992,Not a day goes by that I do not break down in tears at some point. 2021 has been the worst. Lost my job my Aunt and my stepfather. Now I am I am anxiously awaiting the results from a chest xray. My nerves are shot I am stressed I am struggling to pay my bills keep my car on the road still trying to figure out how I am going to afford the new tires I need while not missing a payment. My credit card has been living about 100 away from maxed for the last few months. I am starting to think everything would just be better if I did have lung cancer then when I am gone I can stop worrying about money and happiness and I will not be such a burden on my family.My wife and I have talked about what is going on but I have kept a lot of it from her she sees me crying and does her best to ignore me. I am sure she resents me for being such a useless waste of space. When I am gone she will be able to find someone she can actually be happy with guilt free.I just I do not know I guess I just needed to say it not expecting advice or help just wanted to get some of these ramblings out of my head. Feels like I am all alone in this,Depression
7979,I do not even want to cry anymore. I just want to feel normal and happy. Its been so long that I am not sure what happy feels like anymore. I need help serious mental help. I feel like I am slowly losing the sense of reality. Its been so long that I have felt this way that there is almost a fogginess in my head. I cannot think straight or remember a lot of things. I think I am doomed and Ill never come back to reality. I feel bad,Depression
8091,Earlier today I was thinking how I might just be able to do this. Get feeling better and stay feeling better. It would mean I could stop bothering a couple of people that I turn to for support.This evening I found out one of them has COVID and the other is getting tested tomorrow.I will gladly have my depression return nonstop if it means they are both okay. Please let them get better. I would give my life for them to have more time together. It is selfish of me to get feeling better,Depression
8766,I rather live in a dream until I inevitably expirenever ending and its all ultimately meaningless regardless. So the farther I distance myself from it all the betterI cannot even force myself to care anymore.It really does feel like I was not meant for this world. Like nothing ever mattered and all I could do was run away from the emptiness of knowing the fact.I live to distract myself there is too much..of nothing,Depression
7816,Man when I thought these months were going good nope it was preparing me for this 2 weeks before I felt on top of the world nothing could stop me. I was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. I was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. It was all going good until the next week. I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing fyi first time. Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me fun. Fine I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text no response for days. Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know my school work began to pile up and was now behind awesome! But the funny thing is the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever my exwho hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with dmed me months after our last talk. Ok I am not upset or angry at her she changed alot and is happy with her new bf something I was hoping she would get but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I should not have done this mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new lifemind you I wished for her happiness because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope. I am so tired of having straight up bad luck I want good things to happen I also feel karma may have something to do with thisI am just done. The worst depressive wave this year,Depression
7940,I complained about a bill that did not make sense n my Dr office wanted to send a letter saying I am not allowed to go there anymore but that did not work out so then I get medical insurance they do not accept n they say it is illegal to pay out of pocket so I am backed into a corner n have to go elsewhere but my Dr being a good Dr referse to another office where I can still see the same Dr but they say they cannot accept my ins either. I might be able to still see my Dr if billing will work with me but otherwise iam basically getting booted bc I got medical assistance to pay for pregnancy n miscarriage related bills that were unexpected . I am going thru a lot right now and just want to see the Dr I trust bc I have real trust issues n I honestly feel attacked by the billing people bc I disputed an error n called them out on it and for that I am being punished and cannot continue therapy with my Dr of five or more years or get therapy at either of that drs office. I need help for real but I am scared to press things further bc I have already been punished for questioning billing. I just want to get help,Depression
9107,I am not looking for sympathy or kind words. I just need to briefly open the vent that I so frequently forget is closed.Have you ever seen one of those charity coin spiral devices? You would put a coin in and watch as it spirals down. It would go slowly at first then pick up speed as the circumference becomes smaller and smaller until an audible chink and then silence. It reminds me of a black hole a one way journey to the centre. Well I am somewhere on that spiral maybe not at the bottom but far from the top and past the event horizon from where no matter returns. I guess in a sense we are all on that spiral but I feel much further down than I should be at this point. As I sit at home on my computer slowly deteriorating having been to therapy twice and both times removed from the service for missing appointments all that was interesting or exciting is blown away by the most gentle of winds and all that remains is an empty she will of what once was. I am by choice disconnected from society and I despise the human race and the brutal foundations it so delicately rests upon. I have problems with my stomach which mean I have such little energy that everything feels like a lot of effort and I am in pain most days. The doctors cannot find anything wrong and I have given up trying to find an answer or a cure. I loathe everything about myself and by everything I really do mean e v e r y t h i n g! From the way I look to the way I interact with people to every nuance that defines who I am an incomprehensible number of variables. As I do not like interacting with people anymore and having largely withdrawn from society I have also begun to neglect my hygiene and my health. Every day feels like groundhog day waking up and maintaining myself for nothing just to live another day in pain a pointless expense of energy which I can no longer afford. Many days now I eat one meal per day and struggle to find the energy or will to have a shower and take care of myself. I am beginning to be able to describe myself as Christian Bale from 'The Machinist' but less productive at least Christian goes to work every day and forms some type of relationships. I eat when my stomach allows me to I sleep when I pass out from tiredness I wake when the birds become too loud to ignore and I leave the house when absolutely necessary. I feel sorry for anyone that I befriend as I know I will lose interest eventually have an episode where I do not want to talk to anyone and will inevitably just stop talking to them altogether so I have stopped making new friends as it is not fair on them. I infrequently talk to the one or two I still have and make excuses often for why I cannot talk today. I struggle to make long term goals as I do not see myself being here long term. When I think into the future I see a makebelieve fantasy of what could never exist nothing even remotely tangible given reality as it is precursor and so I prolong my existence with video games and makebelieve a distraction a way to delay the inevitable. But as soon as I exit the video game the day dream the false fantasy and remove the veil of distraction I am thrown back into and reminded of the world in which I am expected to be happy in which I am expected to be grateful a world that I am expected to enjoy but do not. Every day I see the spiral steepening and feel my speed towards the centre increasing. I am not sure when the slope of the spiral will become to steep to maintain my spin and drop me into the darkness of the unknown but I am slipping. A Spiral Into The Inevitable,Depression
8917,What can I say!!! I am happy you messaged me but I do still miss you and have crazy dreams about you I am home,Depression
7200,I have not really posted here for months besides replies. I just really do not know what else I can say who really cares anyways? I have been doing great but I do not feel great.I am reaching my goals and pushing myself but I am still not happy. there is just nothing this world could offer that would make me feel content. I fear the day I have it all but I am still trapped inside my head. it is never enough,Depression
8438,I recently started giving therapy through Betterhelp a shot and after a couple months all she is done is listen then suggest I try going outside scheduling tasks and activities journaling... Is this how therapy normally is? Just an endless list of suggestions I already know will help but I do not have the motivation or energy to try in the first place? I used to do these things when I was in school but it is so hard for me to do anything now. Sure the little accountability I get from her is somewhat helpful but it is starting to feel like cure your depression by doing things that should be easy. My husband went to therapy a while ago and refuses to try it again because it was useless. I am kind of starting to believe him since I can get all this advice from selfhelp websites... Is this how therapy should be?,Depression
8790,Have been feeling depressed for quite a while. A lot of it has to do with my future goals and career just general anxiety and fear for the future. Will be entering college this fall and sorta feel weird about life. I have friends from hs but we do not really talk and I do not really have anyone in my life to talk to or want to talk to. I am just overall very neurotic about my future career. Ill be going down a very difficult and long career path that I believe objectively is one of the hardest ones out there medicine. I have been working really hard to get opportunities and building up my resume and stuff. While I am doing stuff I do like I do not feel happiness in life. There really is not anything that brings me joy. I also feel bad about my body. Sometimes I look at old photos and feel really bad about how I have gained weight. I have struggled with an ED before but I do not have ed issues anymore but it does not stop me from feeling bad about myself. And yea I just do not really feel anything and I do not know if I want to seek professional help. Like overall I feel like the road ahead is going to be very difficult and tiring and I just want a break but I feel like I have not been working hard enough as I have been doing a lot of comparing myself with others lately.Just wanted to get this all off my chest. Just want to write it out,Depression
8470,Failed in every job I ever did because of anxiety cannot even talk to people . Always have panic attacks before work. Too ugly to get a girl. I used to look forward to watch Madrid player each weekend nkw they are shit so what do I have to look forward to Nothing ever goes my way,Depression
8168,Hoping for some sort of logical reason why I should not but it is not going to happen Killing myself,Depression
7068,This has been my life for years now. Just stay alive until the next day then the day after that and the day after that. I never get anywhere. Therapy does not work meds do not work. I have jumped through all the hoops society expects of me to get help. It feels like all the rationales I have used in the past to try and keep going are crumbling. I do not know why I am still here. I am just trying to survive the day,Depression
8196,It seems like all I do is work to survive and I cannot even seem to do that right. I cannot see a psych because my 480 a month medical insurance will not cover it and my insurance is so bad I have accumulated 2k in medical bills this month alone just trying to get a dental cleaning and get my allergies in check. The car that I thought was a fewest decision just broke and Weill now cost me 1300 to fix. I feel like all I am doing is burying myself in debt by making responsible decisions. I am so fucking drained. I do not date because no one appeals to me. I do not go out anymore because I have other expenses. I do not see my family because I am working. And I am working just to keep myself alive and what a fucking life it is. I have had sleep for dinner twice this week because I have no appetite and I am just so tired of being this goddamn stressed all the time. I am currently at the point where I am not sure why go on day to day.,Depression
8743,Or is it just me?? Like I am crying rn and its 5am. you all cry you all selves to sleep??,Depression
8126,Tw suicide mention I feel like nothing seems to excite me anymore. there is so much good in my life but for some reason I still do not feel happy. I am on meds going to therapy twice a week and yet I still feel like this. what is wrong with me? Its as if no matter what I do this numbness and emptiness is always there. Sometimes I can ignore it but it never truly leaves. I know I cannot be happy as myself no matter what happens. Its almost as if I have no choice I know I am going to end up killing myself. Recovery seems too impossible between school and friends and family I do not have enough time to get the help I truly need. I do not think there is anything that could even help me though I guess I am a lost because. Everything feels so bland,Depression
8035,Where else would we be safely expressing and sharing our emotions? there is too much ignorance and too little empathy in this world. The internet truly is a blessingg,Depression
7837,Hello everyone. So I am bipolar in a depressive episode. I can work although hard and I go home and stay in bed and weekends I also stay in bed. I wish I could break this cycle but my meds did not start working yet. How to cope? Any insights? I am depressed and I work and stay in bed this is all my life,Depression
7091,I am tired of putting up a fake smile fake laugh and shit. I think I am depressed like I have a lot of selfhatred suicidal thoughts almost everyday. it is so fucking hard to concentrate on studies. My phone is my only escape. I do not know what the fuck to do now. I do not know if I am depressed or am I just acting like and idiot. I do not know what the fuck I am going to do now.,Depression
7212,So as title states. I had ran out of medication. I tried to get it refilled made a few calls to my psychiatrist office left a couple messages. Even spoke to someone days before it supply ran out. But in the end it was not refilled. Mind you I had not had an appointment since maybe January as I missed my last telephone appointment sometime in spring I believe. I was on the max dose of the prescription I had been on this since the end of 2017 although my dose was not maxed out till around the start of 2019 if I recall correctly. I had been skipping doses here and there but never more than 2 days at a time sometimes I would forget if I had taken my dose for the day and most times I elected not to take said possible missed dose for that day in the event that I did take it. So I am wondering what to expect in the coming weeks or months. Mind you I have a lot of other mental impairments aside from severe depression and bipolar. Some I do not even know anything about. I am currently not sleeping too much it is a lot more difficult to fall asleep now. I am having brain shocks and what not often. I feel like I used to prior to taking this medication. Extreme tiredness slurring my words often not feeling alive at all. Even on the medication I felt tired and weak but it was not as bad as it is while off itI wake up early now and after being up maybe .. 5 hours I start to feel so tired and have 0 energy but cannot napsleep While off the medication if I go for a walk or exercise I get this high and feel like I can do anything lol while on medication I did not really get that even after doing those activities. This is a lot to read and I am sure I confused anyone who has made it this far. But I am hopeful to get some kind of response. I have an appointment with a new mental health professional in 2 weeks if that matters I ran out of Citalopram about 8 or so days ago. what is going to happen?,Depression
7048,Hello everyone I am sorry for this question but I honestly feel curious on why people get depressed what caused it and last but not least why cannot some people treat it?I know it is a bit too rude to ask this but if I never ask I would never learn so again sorry for this post. What caused you to be depressed?,Depression
7028,19 years old male from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist gaslighting bastards apathetic scapegoating victim blaming and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job and he will use it in any arguments we had I am the one who has the job who feeds you and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful! in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud surprising or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure useless goodfornothing and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating abusive and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother she is the epitome of gaslighting victim blaming and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now I have been her downpour of traumas pain bad memories and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui the supernatural superstition and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have and they think everyone should respect them.As their child I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it father had extreme face acne mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway like theirs so no medicine is needed. Due to it I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the Pimple King by my classmates I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now I have fought and kind of got some freedom but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything. These days I cannot find anything enjoyable interesting or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do but my brain just rings out what is the point? and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. LONG POST Someone kill me please,Depression
8829,As the title says the week of July 12th was one of the worst in my life. I feel completely defeated at this point and I just want to give up. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for the last 7 years and for awhile it was helpful for me. We found a good cocktail of medicine that helped me feel normal and helped me function with my daytoday activities. But around the end of May I noticed that my meds just were not as effective as they once were. I have to state that I have been suffering from depression anxiety and PTSD since 2003. I have also been suffering from insomnia in varying degrees of severity since then as well. I cannot stress how absolutely miserable it is to want nothing more than to sleep and not be able to.So back to the 712. I had been visiting my family for awhile since I have been working from home for a year and half and I did not want to be alone every single day. Plus I missed our family dog dearly. So it was great to spend time with her. While I was home I also got a dog for myself just the sweetest little thing. But low and behold she was born with a genetic condition that requires she get a total hip replacement. that is going to be 8K after all is said and done. I do not have that kind of money. Not at all. Anyway when I left to come back home to take care of things here I left my dog behind because her surgery was scheduled back where my folks live and I did not want to stress her out with a lot of back and forth travel. When I left I did not get an opportunity to say bye to our 15 year old family dog. I figured I was coming back for my dogs surgery in August so Id see her then. And then I found out my family had to put her down on 712. That little dog meanteverything to me. I have been used and abused and discarded by people all my life. My family not my nuclear family but the rest my friends everyone. But that little critter loved me unconditionally. And now she is gone. And I did not get to say bye to her. Furthermore my dog is slated for surgery on 812 one month to the day of the other dogs passing. And while I am not superstitious its still causing massive anxietyjust in case anything happens to her. When I got back home I found a new psychiatrist Id changed insurance earlier this year. However he does not accept insurance and its 500 a session. I researched psychiatrists in my area and hes highly recommended and rated. And I like him. However the costyeahalso not helpful for my stress and anxiety. We also changed my antidepressantwhich now costs me 400 bucks a month. Again cannot afford any of this. My weekly therapy is 130. I earn a good amount of money but I happen to live in one of the most expensive areas in the US so my income does not go too far. So I have just been panicking. I am in a ton of debt. I have been trying to do everything right to help better myself. But every time I start to make progress it gets derailed. I have gained about 90 pounds in the last year. And I cannot seem to lose it or change my dietary habits because its so hard for me to care when I feel so exhausted. My job sucks I am paid 60 of what I should be earning in my field as an entrylevel position though I have been doing this for 7 years. I have started looking for other jobs but its just exacerbating my anxiety. Like to the point where its crippling. I feel like I am barely holding it all together and that at any moment the dams going to burst and Ill just spiral. I do not know what to do anymore. Id love for all of this to just be over. I am just so tired. I have had some of the worst weeks of my life and I am just so tired deflated and defeated.,Depression
7773,If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time all we are today is hurdles paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing nothing more than a figment of your mind nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone lifeless and empty nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life. I will warn you this post is not going to be a happy ending,Depression

8812,I am 26. When I was a teenager probably early teenager I had likea prophecy slip into my head I was going to be dead at 30.And its always made sense to me dying by 30. In a way its a little bit of a relief just a couple more years then natures going to pull the plug on me. But its also scary. Like what if I am in my 30s and this dumb body is chugging along??But ever since I was 21 I have only got x more years in this world can you shut the fuck upI joke to people all the time I am going to be dead by 30. I was not built to last.And ever since I was 25 people ask where do you see yourself in 5 years. I honestly have to bullshit that. Because I REALLY think I am going to be dead. By freak illness. Or freak accident. Maybe someone will send an assassin after me!!!I think of all the creatives that die just short of 30. The forever 27 club. Maybe Ill finish my projects that I hope will be meaningful in the next few years maybe I will not. But I got less than 3 years left. Short life expectancy,Depression

8694,Why the fuck was I raised being told men cannot show their true emotions. I had a mental breakdown last night first time I have cried in years and I cannot tell anyone about it. I cannot seek help without looking weak. I was born into a pretty fucked family and I do not know what to do anymore. I am afraid. I have given it all I have but everything just keep getting more and more confusing. there is so much changing in my life and I just do not know how to handle any of this. I do not want my dad to see me in that state I have done so much to make him see me as a man. Mum fucked off years ago so I do not even have a mother figure I can trust to talk to. I just do not know what the fuck to do anymore. I can usually stop myself from feeling how I used to but its all coming back and I am scared. I am going to break soon. Why cannot I talk about it?,Depression
9010,I do not even know where to start I have had have a screwed up life anything bad that can happen does. I have been depressed since I had my daughter and it gets worse and worse. My family has nothing to do with me basically but a select few and the people I do have our not supportive to me with my mental health. I know I am screwed up but I have no insurance or money to pay to get help from a professional when I get down or alone I just need family there to help but most time they just get mad at me and say this again or ruining another time or even I cannot do this anymore. My daughter who is just a child is the only support system I have and I cannot talk to her about anything. I do not know what to do my family says I ruin there lifes because way I am but I do not know how to fix me. I try to hide how I am feeling from family but then it builds up and I explode and its worse but if I show it then its bad to I really do not know what to do or where to go. I do not have any friends I have people I call friends but but they people I talk to once every few months. How can I do this when I do not have anyone in my corner no one that is patient enough to deal with me. I get some my family have mental stuff to but on their bad days I am right there with them supporting helping them through no matter what. I need help figuring out how to get help without insurance or money in away that does not involve my family. Alone and depressed,Depression
8370,I know it is so hard to feel totally alone in the world isolated at a disconnect. Remember that we all struggle alone we all need people we need people to make us feel alive make us feel known they become our safe place where we run away too who is arms we curl up and hide in. it is ok not to be ok alone. it is ok to desperately want and long for people comfort mutuality touch connection emotion.Your not weak for that you have not failed. it is not a societal expectations for a neccecity it is your want you desire that and you are deserved of it.I know practically it is like what do you do? But first and foremost remember in mind that your ok for wanting that needing that. it is not an impossible ask it is just very difficult for you right now.Friendship is a part of life a thing that happens as you live more people more opportunities will come along line as you live. You have not missed your moment this was not your one shot from which ever after you will be alone. You have the whole off your life to work on this.Just keep trying keep working at it learning and growing trying to work the problems your facing understanding what it takes for you to have the friendships that you want. Think of it as less a task with a set end an objective. it is exploration. People are each and every one ends in them selves.it is hard where your at right now I know because I am facing something similar I have been alone some many years now lest some occasional offchance. But do not be hopeless.I think you can be ok. Read if you are completely alone,Depression
8564,I just went through a breakup and the girl wants to stay friends and I want to so I do not hurt her but I know how painful it will be for me. We were better off as friends and now I cannot even be one becuase I still have feelings and it hurts so much. I do not know what to do here I am considering blocking her on everything and having no contact with her until I can get over her but I know that will hurt her. I also try to think all the negative things in order to lose feelings but still it is not working. I am so sad and scared I do not know what to do I need some advice,Depression
8744,I do not want to talk to anyone and I do not have the energy to anyway. All I want to do is go be depressed in bed watch something scroll my phone endlessly. But I have a puppy to take care of and she is just full of energy. It makes me feel worse that I cannot just be happy with her.Right now it feels like just after we my partner and I recover from one thing something else knocks us down. Like legit we were behind on bills for a month or two. We only just recover from that and as we are talking about getting kitchen appliances our puppy desexed maybe have a date night we get fucking curb stomped and we are left without transport and will be dealing with this shit for the next month. We probably will not have any money for the next month and a half. Like living off noodles idk if we will be able to pay our rent no money.it is just one fucking thing after the other and it is been this way for years. I am so fucking beyond depressed and miserable. What the fuck is the point of life if it is just a constant struggle. Is this fucking normal? Is this what life is like for everyone? I am so fucking sick of it. When does shit get to level out and be okay? It feels like I am never going to get better and I am going to be miserable for the rest of my pathetic life. What are you even meant to do when you are having a horrible day and you just have no energy to talk to anyone?,Depression

8201,do not really know where to start so I am going to recount my life a bit. I am a moderately healthy 16yearold who started high school last year. In my country we start high school as 15yearolds. My family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. My parents are still together and I would say they raised me pretty well considering. I have an older brother and an older sister who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but I am still really close to both of them. I love my family and my pets a lot. Right now I think they are the only reason I am still breathing.I have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. I had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. I did not go to kindergarten because of it. When school started I used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. My stomach ached and I was trembling every morning for years. I was just too scared to go to school because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. I missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. I made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday I was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. At the age of seven I held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so I did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much I hated it.Obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. For years it was absolutely useless. They just made me do these weird excersises which I am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. The only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. For example if I had a field trip in a month to a zoo my parents would take me and my siblings there together so I would have an easier time to go there again. This helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. My anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.When I was about to advance to seventh grade 13yearold me my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. Couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying all my best friends were on the same class as me I had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. Life was going really well at this point and even though I was anxious I could go to school pretty normally even though I still missed many days. At it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so I had to stay home a lot. Whenever things were going bad I thought about suicide but never planned it out.On my last year before high school my anxiety just skyrocketed and with it I became very depressed. I was not too outgoing before but now I could not even go to the store without anyone else. I did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though I really liked being with them. Before I was a staight A student but I could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. I was a perfectionist yet I did not care if I finished my assinments anymore. My grades dropped heavily. Smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. On some nights I did not eat because I could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. Some days I could not get out of bed. So many of my hobbies became untouched. I could not play games like before I could not play he piano anymore and I could not write stories like I used to. I became entirely paralysed.My therapist was really worried about how I was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. I was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that I was otherwise doing just fine even though I was basically dying inside. My mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. I was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that I was barely functioning. This was the first time I could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. I was in so much pain. The only things I cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because I could not keep up anymore. The only reason I did not kill myself was because I did not want to die in pain and I had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. I have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. Not to my family not to my friends and not to my therapist because I am afraid of he consequences.During that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework news or worry about outside life. They wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so I could enjoy my time playing games. I have never felt so relieved. Before that I was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday The freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. At the end of those two weeks I returned to school. I was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end I was beginning to feel a lot worse again. All that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. I had just pushed them away from my mind. I became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like I never left.That same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. No pressure no expectations. I did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. I was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window I could see how wonderful the weather was outside. I could finally do the things I liked again and I could actually enjoy them this time.That did not last of course because then I went to high school to continue my studies. To my surprise the first weeks went well even though I was really anxious. Two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. I spent every moment with them and I had fun. The problems started when I could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. I failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowballeffect. My selfesteem was in the gutter and I started to hide in my room again. I slowly became me from before that two week vacation. I became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. I could not go to classes. I could not do my homework and I couln't participate in any group activity. I started failing more classes even on subjects that I previously could have aced with my eyes closed. I spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.For the last 67 months I have not been to school at all. I have met doctors and I have met with my guidance counselor for more times then I can count. My anxiety is through the roof and each time I explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor the answer is always We know it is hard for you to go to school because xy and z. You just need to try going to school.Like I had not fucking thought of that before. I am suffering inside my own head thoughts screaming how I cannot do shit and how behind I am going to be and how useless I am. For every day I started crying because I was so afraid of going to school. I could not read anything because I just could not understand the alphabets. I am nearly having panic attacks when I just think about going school. One day I became so enraged that I punched my door hoping that I would break my own arm. But thanks I had not thought of going to school. Right now I have been on summer break again but in a week I need to go back to school but I just do not know how I can. I start crying every time I think about school. I just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. I just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when I have not even started to live independently yet. I am terrified.Any advicestories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.Thanks for reading this far Feeling lost this is my situation,Depression

7974,I do not know what I am going to do. Do I want to play do I want quit and give up. I do not want to let my coach down but if that is the only reason then why play. The problem is somedays I want to play but then I second guess myself or the opposite. it is just so frustrating. Why do I have to make everything so difficult if I could just decide that is one less problem that I have to deal with. I want to tell him that I am going through some shit right now but what am I supposed to tell him. Sorry coach my asshole mom's boyfriend broke up with her smashed a bunch of shit yelled and kicked her and I just sat in my room like a pussy. Then to top it off she experienced everything that I do feeling restless little to no sleep and always nervous. Then she had the nerve to complain to me about it and get back with him not even a month later. For ten years that man scared me to the point where I did not want to be in the same room as him and when I finally felt free from worrying about being yelled at or having to hear the dogs get beaten she pulls him right back into our life telling me one day I am going to understand. a bunch of other stupid stuff.

7211,I am so depressed.The thing is growing up I had high dreams for myself.Really high dreams.I was lucky in the sense that I was born with talents. I could sing and grew up being praised for my voice. I was a fabulous writer who thrived off books and poetry. As I got into my teen years I began to love fashion. I could have been a singer or a writer or even a fashion designer.I could have had friends. Fun hilarious and artistic friends like me. And instead I became none of those things I so desperately loved. I do not have any friends because I am pretty different and I do not find it easy to click with people that often especially in the town I ended up living in.I am 31 and I have a daughter who I adore and love more than life itself. But I still cannot help but feel cheated out of the life I felt I knew I was meant to have.When I hear music sometimes I cry just thinking about how I wanted to do that. If I see a woman thriving in her writing careerWell.. you guessed it! That shoulda coulda would have been me.I am struggling with addiction and anxiety and yet I feel like an imposter even saying that. I have no support. My partner is kind but whatever is wrong with me is way too much for him. SignedBroken 30 something and depressed,Depression
8353,Like the title implies. it is been quite a few weeks since I last selfharmed to the point where most scars have faded as my family has not said anything when I wear tank tops or dresses. That or they just do not give a shit. did not do it to 'feel something' or 'let my emotions out I am not good at reading my own emotions but I am pretty sure it was just to punisg myself when I slacked on schoolwork. Well I am out of Sixth Form now waiting to see if I have gotten into uni generally doing OK with the help of meds then suddenly one tiny bad thing and BOOM. I want to take some scissors to myself. I acted like a shitty friend said I was ill when I just was not up for voicechatting and now I just want to punish myself again. And to be honest? I do not see why I should not. I did something wrong they are too nice to call me out on it so I should carry out punishment myself. With the area I have chosen there is little to no chance of any risk and I do not really mind scars so why the hell not? I deserve it! OBV I do not CONDONE THIS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT FOR ME IT MAKES SENSEMainly posting here to vent partially posting to figure out if this is logical or if I have stumbled into a delusional mental break again. Why should not I tw selfharm mention,Depression

She has been suffering for so many years and literally she tells me that I am too good for her but I do not want to leave her since I want and I feel able to help her or minimally be close to her but she tells me that her life will not last more than 1 year since just the day she turns that day that day she will kill herself and it is a margin of time that I have but still I do not know how to encourage her anymore That yesterday she tells me that she began to think about her life and does not remember any happy moment she had and then in the end I managed to calm her down and everything was fine until today where her brother hit her and almost killed her by hanging her and the fight did not tell me why it was but her own mother challenged her brother to kill her and at the end of a single madness step and she meanwhile told me this in her room kind of what the fuck am I going to do in the sense of I am 18 years old I literally think of ways to make her feel better but not I can be even less where I live then at You 18 are not necessarily independent anymore so I do not know what to do to help her since I feel that the more time passes the worse it gets and my efforts are useless and it does not help me to leave and leave her alone since that may make her decide already kill yourself and I do not want that. I do not know what to do that is why ask for even some advice I do not tell my parents because I feel the answer is obvious My girlfriend has depression and more problems and how her boyfriend does not know what to do even if he is willing to help her,Depression
7214,My ex who I still love so much is on my mind all day. I think about how bad if fucked up and could not conquer my demons. This depression is just to much. I wish I was dead. All I do is think about her all day long...,Depression

7269,Sometimes i feel better for about a week and then i just get depressed again. And when i mean feel bettee i more or less mean uncomfortable. Its so out of the blue and i just wonder why i suddenly feel stable and then i question so much. Its not really feeling better. I honestly do not know what it is but i do not like it. I mean i cleaned my room at least. Man this sucks! I hate when i feel better for a few days then fall right back into it,Depression
7715,Ugh this probably not the right place for this. But I have a friend who keeps asking me for money every single time. Yesterday this person texts me asking if they can stay at my house for a few days. My place is way too small so I told them no. Today I get asked to send 50 dollars to them I told them my account is negative but I unfortunately am way to nice I told them I can give them 30 I went into my savings I barely have any savings at this point. Last week same issue asking me for money twice this is annoying. I understand that my friend is going through hard times but its too much like then I end up feeling bad if I tell them no. I want to end all ties with this person but I do not know I just feel horrible right now. What should I do Friend keeps asking for money,Depression
7448,Sometimes the things that break us eventually do set us on the right path. Even when its messy and fucks with your brain. Keep on fam. I have recently begun the divorce process and while it was heartbreaking I have been better everyday that we have been apart.,Depression
8726,I am broken. I have dx adhd and depression. I take adhd medication.I am probably also on the autism spectrum but I do not have the money to figure that out.I am an intelligent being that cannot actuate potential and get through the mental roadblocks everywhere and explaining that to someone just leads to them thinking I am lazy. If being so mentally broken that you cannot do some basic things is laziness then yes I am lazy. I am not really suicidal in the way that like I do not enjoy life. I do when not thinking about workfinancials. More in like a I feel like such a useless member of our capitalist society maybe it would be better for everyone if I was just gone. I just cannot seem to earn my stay and obviously that is important. I am currently barely scraping to get unemployment with the help of my parents since I am unable to do it myself Mental health issues jobless 9 months,Depression
7536,My depression is fucking everything. I have had to quit 2 different jobs mechanic and lawncare. Both should not seem stressful but each caused my suicidal thoughts to sky rocket. I just need something low stress that likely will not because this what is a low stress jobs?,Depression
7254,If I could go back. Id change it all. Every small choice. Every stupid life changing decision. I have fucked it all up.,Depression
8214,I have my first new therapy sesh in a half hour and I am hoping it helps. I moved back home to my parents basement last summer after going thru severe depression from my first ever relationship ending. i feel really guilty because i said and did horrible things to make my ex feel the pain i was feeling and lost the great friendship we had because i wanted so badly to keep him interested in me just to make myself feel like i was worth something. or to distract from how meaningless my life has always felt. I am a gay almost 25 year old from a big city and i had a good network of people in high school who still live here but they are all straight and i do not relate to them much. were not close. before moving back home i lived in my college town another big city. most of my friends there were straight too and i felt different but i had closer relationships with them. since high school I have been deeply depressed and dissociated from my life so much i just showed up got the grades and graduated. no college professors to write letters of rec for grad school. credit score sucks. stuck in a dead end job here that i do a terrible job at because it feels pointless. it requires me to go into areas of the city that have shootings every day so I am always on edge that ill get shot or carjacked. it also sucks being the only gay person in a straight male dominated space. I have switched jobs every six months or so since finishing college 3 years ago so my resume looks too bad to get a cool new job. but i also feel like working in this strange capitalistic society is a waste of my time here on earth. i feel that there is so much i could accomplish but i have no avenues to achieving them. i now have an expensive ass car note so cannot quit my job. i am afraid ill never be successful have my own place live a life I am happy with fulfill any purpose. i fight suicidal thoughts daily. i feel so alone and hopeless and idk where to go from here. Feeling Stuck and Hopeless,Depression
7779,that is pretty much it there is such a lack of hope in my life that my therapist cannot even be bothered. My PHQ9 has gone up to 2527 GAD7 is at 1215.I just want to go missing as in 411 style. Being so hopeless that even my therapist misses my appointment.,Depression
8545,I just do not know what to do anymore. I am 29 not done anything noteworthy with my life. Been dealing with depression literally all of it. And I just cannot gain any ground. I am doing all the right things. I have been reaching out for help since I was a teen begging my parents to let me see a doctor and get some medicine. I am in good shape. I exercise. I eat mostly well. I have friends. I am in decent overall health. I have got a stable life. I have got an objectively great job some family a few good friends finances are okay can afford to buy and do things I want. I have never done drugs not even so much as vaped or smoked a cigarette I do not drink But here I am every step along the way at my doctors and counselors doors begging for help. Trying all the medications I am on 4 now. And they help yeah but not enough. Got diagnosed with OCD which makes a lot of sense but does not help things. I have tried meditation CBT you name it. I am trying it. And I am not gaining any sort of ground. I can only wake up and bullshit pat myself on the back of doing the bare minimum of making it through another day so many times that it just feels pathetic. And exhausting. I am just so exhausted. I want to turn this movie off. I am not having a good time and I know the movie will not suddenly get better so what is the point?I am just so done. I am exhausted. What is even the point? I am making it through another day. So what? Now I am a little closer to actually dying in a way people will accept?I am just so spent.Exhausted.I just cannot keep doing this. At what point do we admit that some people just cannot be helped? Either they are too far gone or its just not in the cards for them?I do not want to admit that about myself but I cannot ignore brazen fact. I just do not think I am cut out for life. And the ONLY thing and I do mean ONLY thing keeping me from taking my life is the pain I would feel during it. Everything else I have already come to grips with. Making mom sad? Leaving my cats? Making a mess for the police to clean up? Etc. I have accepted all of that. I just literally cannot do this. I am trapped in this movie I cannot turn off and I am ready to burn the theater down. I just do not think I am one who can be helped. Is it possible to be beyond help?,Depression
7916,my whole fucking life has been full of mental and physical abuse ever since i was a kid weird shit has been happening. been abused by my moms bf for 15 years after my dad left from doing something that fucked up the whole families reputation and flow. i was like 4 so i barley remember him. but i do remember he was a POS just for my mom to get another piece of shit 2 weeks later. my whole life I have been subjected to violence and mental torture the shit they used to do and yell at each other is unremarkable and kids should not beim out of energy. i should have jumped off that bridge but things turn full circle. full circle back into where i got broken in the first placethe only thing that will make me feel better is going off the grid leaving this phone behind and becoming homeless. my mental health has been decreasing. and there nothing i can do about itshe kept me locked away inside for 23 years 23 FUCKING YEARS OF A TEENAGERS LIFE WHO THE FUCK DOES THAGthen she glt another POS after she broke things off with the other abusive shit. I have gotten into fist fights for 16 years straight. not a year I have missed without seeing violence. and its taken a toll out of me. and now that its just me my sister and mom. they think they can act like nothing ever happened. like they did not expose me to shit that would make a normal person blow their fucking head offshe touched me sexually as a child and I am younger so she is fucked up in the fucking head. i hate her i hope she fucking dies. she is always nagging at my flaws and what i cannot do in life. all welll knowing i cannot confront her about it same with my mom she fakes mental health to escape responsibilities.she was fine when we were not living with her. now that were in a tough spot and have to live with the person who broken us in the first place . i cannot handle itwe have no more family. i do not want to look at them or talk to them anymore man I am fucking tired of it. they deny everything i been throug.

7657,I am a coward I do not have the guts to take my own life but why does not my body give up on my part. I have not done anything to deserve this I wish my body stops working in sleep everyday. My parents so many expectations so many hopes I crush them all day in day out. My parents deserved a much much better child they did not deserve a disaster like me but they still love me and it makes me do guilty. I am beyond repair but still I cannot dispose myself off cowardice. I do not want to exist I wish I get replaced by someone else or at the least get vanished into oblivion along with all the traces and memories I have in this world. Fuck this rant sounds cringe sorry you had to read this. Why does my heart keep beating my body keeps working hard to keep me alive even though I have given up?,Depression
7378,In lifeyou have have dreams and aspirations that you want to achieve but when depression hits it humbles you and what seemed achievable yesterday seems impossible today.Everyone chases money I would give anything for a state of calmness and ease. Depression really is humbling.,Depression
8169,just a check in post. I am curious to see how you all are doing how are you?,Depression
8425,Tyson fury and countless other champions had to get through it why would it be any easier for me this D actually hurted me so much but still teached me so many life lessons but still I am on my knees each time i get up I am scared so i do not try anymore fearing that this will not work. Being for 1 hours on the ground tasting all kind of emotions anger pain tears.. If my life has to be this way so be it but i are not going to let her enjoy shredding me imma make sure there gon be blood from each sides I learned something really life changing if you love it you will not have to work hard for it all she managed to do is making love being in pain now i love pain i are not saying i want it but at least i will not have to cary the burden of hating it guys we will make it incha allah . Allahu akbar peace Is it over ?,Depression
7240,I got really triggered today I do not know if that is the right word I guess I just mean extremely emotionally disturbed by an article I read about how bad violence gets in prisons. How can people do such horrible things and why do none of the staff do anything to stop it? Why is prison rape so commonly joked about? it is not funny at all it is a nightmare. I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soulshattering that experience would be. I cannot stop thinking about how many people are going through that right now as I type this and about how they will continue to go through it for years or even decades. Endless suffering. I cannot stop imagining it over and over again.it is really hard for me to stop thinking about all of the agony that people and animals are put through and everytime I get triggered like this it is like every horrible thing I have seen comes racing back to the front of my mind. I once saw a video of someone grabbing a piglet by his hind legs and slamming his little head against a concrete floor. Another of probably hundreds of baby chicks being stuffed into a garbage bag and suffocated. How on earth could someone do that to tiny defenseless innocent babies? My brain becomes overwhelmed with the images of these scenes and imagining myself in their place and wanting to save them and wanting someone to save me. I do not know how to get it out of my head other than to off myself. There is so much unimaginable suffering TW violence sexual assault animal abuse,Depression
7949,Skin veiled tightly an accoutrement for ones bones Decay shelled with living Insentient and autolytic Antlers protrude timorously only to fold piercing within A poem I wrote last night,Depression
8839,First I am sorry English is not my native language.I feel empty I do not care if we need to be with another humans I do not really know if I want to spend time meeting other persons because I cannot make friends. I have a boyfriend and 3 pets that are all the family that I hace but recently one of my dogs passed away and I cannot stop thinking that I am the worst owner and of course I am overthinking about every aspect of my social life. Toby I always cry for you. I miss you. My dog recently die and I do not have friends I lost my best friend.,Depression
7675,It was in 2011early 2013. I was feeling particularly empty that day for some reason. I felt sad but the emotion felt distant. I was looking for the Sponge Bob episode A Flea in Her Dome. I saw a low quality video of it and all of a sudden I started feeling down. I felt this weird nostalgic feeling but not a good one. It was the feeling you get when your life goes by too fast despite the fact that I was only 911. I was crying uncontrollably all day long but like I said my emotions felt distant. I was feeling a pain deep in my stomach and in the back of my throat. It felt like I had to forcefully exaggerate my expressions to force out the sadness. I honestly do not know how to explain it. I felt empty and like the emotions were distant and far off. I felt removed from myself. Idk how to explain this but I have felt empty inside since then and I am only 18Malmost 19.I am sorry if I explained this horribly I remember the last time I cried.,Depression
8360,Hello peopleI hope everyone who is struggling right now can hold on even if it means taking it 5 minutes at a time. I will try to keep this short and sweet bittersweet? is that more appropriate in this context?. I just turned 40 in February. Everyone who I have discussed age with assures me age is just a number. But this year feels a little different. I am not suicidal or in danger of hurting myself or anyone else. I have struggled with depression and some anxiety since I was 18 or so. At times mainly in my 20's I was hospitalized afraid to live but just as afraid to die. I did recover somewhat and was able to hold down a job for a few years.These days I just feel this feeling growing that things will only get harder that I am 40 and that any chance to make something of myself is behind me. Thank you for reading this. If anyone would like to chime in and share how they feel I would appreciate it. In Limbo,Depression
7396,Today I had perhaps the most emotional moment I have had in my two and a half years of therapy. I realized that finally I have gotten better. I am 18 and have been depressed for the past 7 years now and each day of those 7 years it you asked me to choose between life and death I would choose death every time. But today I finally voiced that I would not choose death this time. I would not choose death today. Today I would choose to live. I made it. I am by no means cured but I made it. And that is enough for me right now. I have gotten better.,Depression
8420,I can feel it. Its like a storm. Its heavy. Its a constant down pour. Most days I go on auto pilot so I can get through work and do what is expected of me. But I can feel myself getting worse and do not want to loose myself again. But nothing helps. I have tried talking to family and friends but I always feel like I am bothering them. I am too emotional. I cannot just be happy. And I am afraid to loose this battle. Help.,Depression
7043,I do not know what happened. Over the course of one night I went from optimistic to questioning my reality. I am a 27M and it seemed like I got under eye wrinkles within a night. I do not know if I did not realise it before but I certainly did the morning after and the revelation hit me like a bus. I look old. Older than a 27 year old. I am single I have no career no degree no money and have nothing going on in my life. But the odd thing was before that night I was still hopeful about things turning around in my life. But as soon as I saw my wrinkles that hope just seemed to vanish into the creases under my eyes. I realised I was no longer young and the thought of getting old alone is scary. Finding a partner was hard enough but this will only make it harder. The thought of aging is depressing me.,Depression
8938,it is been so hard to motivate myself to do anything recently. I am moving out of my home tomorrow yet tonight I have not even started packing. I hate how I just stay on the couch all day. I am moving tomorrow but I have not even packed anything yet.,Depression
6990,My ex and I broker up after 3 years a few months back. I tried desperately to get her back after realizing i really did still love her. It failed and she is done and she has our cat we got together. I still love them dearly and I know ill probably never see them again. I finally got the courage to go through my phone and try to erase the photos of the cat. I just cannot do it. I have spent an hour going through the gallery and snap chat. I have just set them to hidden. It hurts far too much. I have been suffering through depression after realizing what I had let go what I had lost. My little family. These photos are almost the last moments and belongings I have left of them. I am trying so hard to heal but it hurts thinking ill need to forget our kitten.Does anyone else have any of advice for this? It really reopened a wound that was starting to heal. Maybe I just needed to vent for the day I had to go through all the pictures of my ex and kitten today,Depression
8646,I always read that telling people you trust is the best option for getting help but it just feels meaningless when they tell me I should think about my future and how I should fight for my life when I am suicidal. Literally all I see for my future is suicide and if not then unemployed pathetic still relying on my parents etc. I feel like a baby that is not trying and I am convinced that I really am just lazy and not trying but why should I when I see no point in it. I plan to kill myself soon anyways. None of it will matter. You just get mad and insult or laugh at me when I tell you that so I will not and your eyes are always filled with judgement. I do not get why you do not want to tell me to kill myself instead of going through the struggle of telling me why I should not Telling me to fight for my life will not work since I am suicidal,Depression
7840,a couple weeks ago my therapist told me i was self sabotaging myself and now i always think about it. i seek everything from within myself. i do seek validation from others but i desire validation from myself more and i cannot seem to find it because i continue to constantly put myself down and degrade myself. if i do not like how i look then I am ugly. if i do not think i can draw well then i cannot draw. if i think I am dumb then i must be dumb. i feel like such a insignificant person yet i want that person to love me. its unhealthy and i cannot get out. its all my fault that i am this way. I am the only one who can fix it but they think they can if i tell them a way that i cannot even find myself. Self sabotage is eating me alive,Depression
8746,Apologies in advanced because this is going to be a long one tldr at the bottom for anyone who wants to skip over it. I am just having a bad night and found this reddit so figured a good as place as any to get it all out there and maybe seek some kind of advice.ampx200BMy mental health struggles started when I was a kid I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin as well as told I should probably seek some type of counseling along with the treatments. However after a few short weeks my parents took me off the meds because they did not like how it made me act From what I hear a common complaint. Unfortunately no treatment or anything was ever followed up with so I have been dealing with that untreated for awhile Honestly I am so used to it at this point that the symptoms I deal with I have always described is as not being able to make my head silent. are so ingrained as normal that I forgot about it for a long time.ampx200BAside from that I was actually a happy if not otherwise busy minded kid. However things changed when I was ten. Without getting into the nitty gritty details two major life events happened The first was an extremely bad car crash that left my mother with a painful and permanent physical disability that not only made living physically painful but also completely changed her personality due to the mix of pain and eventual medications. It also left me with deep mental scars which I have been told is a form of PTSD. I still cannot drive to this day because being in vehicles gives me panic attacks even just riding does and as I am sure you can imagine a panic attack behind a driving wheel is potentially disasters as well as how...crippling it is to not be able to drive in today's world especially when you do not live in or near a city with public options. The second thing was molestation and rape something that went on under my parent's nose for five years. It only stopped when the person in question essentially moved away. My mother only found out a few years ago when I broke down about it the rest of my family is still in the dark about it. This is where a lot of my problems really stem from and my life took a nose dive from this point onward. Depression suicide attempts when I was younger self loathing hating the world and just all around being confused and angry at everything and everyone with no way to deal with it.ampx200BTo add on to it and forgive me if this offends anyone but being a male I felt like I could not even seek help for it for the longest time. The stigma is not as strong now ah days though it does still exist that many of the things that happened to me cannot really happen to guys and if it did there are..well I am sure you get the picture. Despite this I have seen doctors I have been given..so many diagnosis it is hard to keep any of them straight been on a lot of pills which never seemed to work and currently am unmedicated and seeing no one.ampx200BThis brings me all the current day. Despite all these issues I met someone who loves me. We got married recently. I have been happier then I had been in years in all honesty she is the only person I have left anymore. My family wants nothing to do with me and vice versa. But now that I have someone who depends on me as much as I do them...my mental state is getting worse. ampx200BI still cannot drive. it is preventing me from getting work. My self loathing has turned into almost paranoid delusions because I cannot rectify in my mind why she would even stick with me or love me. The more she tells me it is alright the more she tells me I do not have the worry about it the worse it gets. The majority of her family hates me because they think I am a lazy sack of shit. I try to talk to her about it but I end up just making her feel bad like she is doing something wrong when that is not the case. I feel like I am spiraling out of control I feel like she would be better off without me. I just do not know what to do or how to deal with any of this. My mind is so twisted with what I think is happening and what is actually happening I almost cannot separate the two and tell which is real and which is just my fucking head talking. I thought for awhile I was getting better but now I feel more afraid and alone then I ever have before and I am doing it entirely to myself and I do not know how to stop it.My life has felt like a constant train wreck up until this one bright point this one little miracle happened to me and I am going to absolute shit over it. I need help. I need advice I need something. I am terrified to lose her. I am terrified of hurting her some way or another or dragging her down with me. I just do not want to be alone anymore yet I feel like I am driving myself towards that inevitable conclusion.So if anyone has any advice..anything at all please...help me. Sorry for the long post..just needed to get it out.tldr PTSD life long depression ADHD all relatively untreated. Managed to fall in love and get married. Was happier. Now it is all crashing back down and just...royally fucking with me. cannot drive cannot get a job feel completely alone and worthless. Afraid to hurt the one person I love. cannot imagine what she sees in me. Not sure what to do with my life anymore,Depression
7881,it is hard. I am finding even when I am barely waking up my mind is already off to the races. In this constant search for some form of answer or conclusion as to where my inner critic became so harsh and what caused it.it is like my brain is constantly quantum computing trying to add up the traumas the emotions all these images that reside in my mind. Scanning calculating trying to figure out the absolute source but I know deep down there is no one source. That does not stop my brain from trying before that critic starts to scream some more. It will not be long but maybe I can track it. Figure out the reasons it surfaces but sometimes it just seems to be from nothing at all.it is a scary thought when your brain turns against you. That saying depression is like living with a body that tries to survive and a mind that tries to kill you I am paraphrasing because I do not know the exact quote but you get the idea. Take a breath,Depression
7824,Nothing i can do will fix that. I am never going to be enough,Depression
7215,i have been depressed most of my life i am now 27 and everytime i seem to get somewhere with being happy my mind just forces itself to become depressed again back to the comfort zone.. i was reading that depression swells the brain over the years or something.. is it possible to be depressed beyond return? i have no wants in life at all anymore i have long just been waiting to die contemplating suicide but the trail of destruction i would leave behind for my partner parents siblings ect is something i cannot do i do not want to disperse my depression among those who have tried their best to help me. depressed beyond the point of return,Depression
8461,I do not belong in my family.. I do not belong in my country... I do not belong in this planet.. I do not belong in this universeprobably I do not belong here,Depression
7034,I finally got my depression well under control at the end of this last year. I was managing an exercise routine cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food spending more quality time with my family enjoying hobbies again thriving in school and managing a self care and hygiene routine which was always one of my big struggles.I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior. I do not shower or brush my teeth for days at a time I find myself binge eating and falling back into restrictive eating disorder habits I only really look forward to eating and getting in bed every night. The Fall semester is set to begin and I do not even think I will be able to do it. If I am lucky I might slide by and pass but I am going to suffer even more with that on my plate too. Why the fuck cannot I be a functioning person? Sometimes I want to move away from my family and just let myself self destruct to my hearts content. I feel like I live to eat and sleep again,Depression
8043,having narrisstic parents makes it worse cannot wait to go back to school staying at home too long gave me brain fog and depression,Depression
7224,With what medications can I almost commit suicide? I just want to almost die and go to the hospital I am running out of options to get my ex's attention she did not care that i cut myself I just want to talk to her. What meds or pills can i take?,Depression
7041,Quick background I suffered social anxiety for most of my 20's and went in and out of depression throughout the years. I am now 31 with no friends just a boyfriend and all my family who I barely get along with anyway live in another state. Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless. I also went through a horrible year in 2019 where I went numb to something that was happening in my relationship so I would not feel so much kind of like depersonalizationderealization. Things have gotten better but the numbness has remained. I am not sure how to explain it properly but I do not have anything in my life that is thrilling or exciting to me nor do I care to seek this out. Most people have a vice like shopping gambling some sort of sport or activity that gives them a rush. I used to want to travel I thought maybe that could fill my time or get me excited but even though I have the money and could travel once out of lockdown I just do not care for it anymore. it is like I cannot take the memories when I die so what is the point? I could sit in my lounge room and street view places in Canada for example so once again what is the point?All I do these days is work come home click around on some sites and do it all again the next day. I barely talk to anyone online. My relationship is boring and stale and even though we could spice it up sometimes I just do not care to. I love my boyfriend but I want someone else to talk to and hang out with. I almost have no reaction to things. If I won a million dollars or even 5 I think my reaction honestly would be meh. Everyone my age is either having kids married or have successful careers. I have never chased success so I really do not care to climb the career ladder or chase money. None of that matters to me. I am not sure what does. I cannot help but feel as if I am wasting my life away. Sometimes I wish I could have a crazy life. Sometimes I get the urge to do something so out of character to shock myself. To get that thrill. To feel excitement.God I am so utterly bored with my life. I feel numb about most things. I feel very little excitement or thrill in life.,Depression
7878,I am on the verge of doing it and I am a useless piece of shit anyways. I cannot spell I am failing school and I am stupid as fuck. Give me one reason why I should not go and hang myself in my back garden.,Depression
7042,I grew up being a very bad kid i smoked weed from age 9 first time i got drunk i was 13 since child hood we moved from place to place never had my friends as we always moved since i was 18 i moved away from my parents to another country and 3 years later still cannot make friends because people are so fucking antisocial here i lost my first son after 3 days of birth due to placenta seperation and now my job is pissing me off i want to break up with my gf but i love her money is a big issue and recently I have been having suicidal thoughts and other thoughts is there anyone that has any tips? Tired of living weird thoughts,Depression
8027,All the friends I made in school had another friend that they were closer to or liked more. I was never anybodys first choice or number one. I always did my very best to be likeable and I was always a good friend but I just never found that in school. My sister and I were very close throughout our entire childhood and into our adulthood but recently our relationship changed and I do not think it will be the same again. I have a chronic illness now and I do not work outside of the home. My husband works for us. Its even more difficult to make friends now being sick. The pandemic made it worse. I did try chatting with new friends online but they would forget about me after a week and would stop putting in any effort. I was always carrying the conversation.I dunno. I have become a bit of an introvert over the years. I think I am fine with what I got. I have a huge family and I have nourished those relationships quite well. My husband tells me all the time that I am his best friend. Hes sweet. I do have one friend outside the family that checks up on me so there is that. I guess I just want to know if any of you have felt this way? I never found a best friend.,Depression
7841,Is there something I can do to stop from feeling so utterly alone I have friends and family but I feel so alone. Nothing I seem to do helps me. I work outdoors so I am in the sun. I just do not know how to deal. And things are getting worse I am starting to not want to leave my bed I really do not want to eat tho I know I need to. I game a lot but I feel as if I use it as a distraction to keep my mind from further spiraling down. I just want to know what can I do to help bring this around Just down,Depression
7569,I am open to anything that will bring my emotional health up to balance. I have a full time job and I was attending virtual therapy until a few weeks ago since I did not feel like I had anything to say.I am also on antidepressants.I feel like I have taken on bad coping mechanisms like binge watching Netflix and skipping meals for junk food that I do not even enjoy as much as I think I do.Maybe I am accelerating the healing? what is the best way to spend your time after a traumatic incident like sudden death in the family?,Depression
6995,I have not seen my 7 year old daughter in a couple of months because she moved across the country with her mom and it has literally been killing me. My mind was telling me our relationship was damaged forever because of this. She is the only bright spot in my entire life. I have just been alternating between drinking and crying mostly.Today we connected in an online game and had a great time we are hopefully going to be playing regularly from now on and I will get to talk to her and bond with her through this. it is a pretty basic online game for kids but the first thing she did when she met my avatar was to shrink her own avatar into a little baby and jump on my shoulders like she did when she was a toddler in real life. I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine. She does not deserve to lose her dad and I now have new motivation to push on and try to get better.If a terminal case like me can do it so can you hopefully. My daughter just pulled me out of a black pit of despair,Depression
7938,Can depression be incurable????? Can depression be incurable?,Depression
7268,Help me feel better. I thought Id be long gone by now. Its inhibited me from moving on with my life. I am 21 and quarantine kicked me out of school so I am stuck with my thoughts. Who else thought they would be gone by now and how did you manage the future that you thought you would never have? Who here thought they would be gone by 14? 16? 18? How do we progress?,Depression
8625,It feels like everything is just a blur now. it is there and then it is gone like it is nothing. It feels neverending and way too short at the same time. I have not felt like this until the last 2 years. I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember but it is never been this bad. It really sucks cus I feel like I cannot truly appreciate the time I have with others. I have been suffering for a long time. I have honestly given up at this point and the only reason I still try to push myself and progress is for other people. I know I need to love myself and treat myself better I am trying really. I have been trying but I have never tried so hard in my life. it is so hard. I only ever talk to 4 people which I do not have a problem with at all but despite having these people in my life I feel so alone in this world. Not the sense of loneliness in my room late at night or loneliness from lack of love or affection but just this lonely feeling. I feel so much pain and yet I feel nothing at the same time. I do not know what to do and I do not know why I am posting this really. I have been trying to keep it to myself. When it gets bad I hold the gun in my hand look at it and just think. I do not know exactly what I am thinking in those moments there is so much running through my head. I wonder if there was no one on this earth I loved or cared for would I be able to do it? There are so many beautiful things in life but this dark cloud takes over and distorts my vision almost literally. It feels like it controls all of my body. I am not sure how to explain it. I do not know anymore,Depression
7738,I could finally die without having to leave my family with the fact that I killed myself. Even if it was three five years in the future Id be so grateful knowing I had a guaranteed expiration date and did not have to stay here indefinitely. I know I have said this before but getting a terminal illness would be the best thing that could happen to me,Depression
9122,Anyone else even tortured them n their dreams? Even my dreams are all. Depressing shit Hey,Depression
8129,I am so fucking tired of feeling like this. A deep sadness deep into my bones. Exhausted,Depression
7249,I was working like a madman. This meant traveling all over the world constantly worried about deadlines and sales quotas and just living one todo item after another. The year would fly by and I would not know where it went but I was not depressed I was engrossed.But it was a bad thing because it was fulfilling the goals I wanted for myself. I was just a slave to the corporate machine.Ironic.Slavery or despair. Those were my only two choices. Somebody should have told me. The only time I was not depressed in life was when,Depression
7909,I was about to graduate in the coming week with my PhD. I have been suffering through depression for past 2 years now and one year back my then gf of 5 years left me stating this is not what she signed up for.I am at the end of my funding and I cannot afford to pay for another semester. I deserve this because I could not fight through my depression and now its my time to pay my dues. I wasted time and resources trying to get my head straight but what I should have focused on is my PhD. Being an international student in US its difficult to extend my student status with enough financial backing.I just wanted to post and share it because I have been trying to keep all this inside and its been suffocating me. I feel like a disappointment and a burden on my aging parents. There is no worse feeling than being a burden on your parents. I just feel it would be easy if I did not exist. 28 M looking for some support,Depression
7573,Sorry if this sort of thing is not allowed I just need to tell someone.I tried to kill myself when I was six and once again a year later. I have never stopped being suicidal I had to go to the hospital when I was 14 because I felt like I would kill myself. Since I was 1213 I have been planning on killing myself when I am 19 the only reason why I did not kill myself when I was 14 was because I wanted to give myself a few more years for my life to get better. I have 2 years until I am 19 my life has only gotten worse. I have been saving up to get a mentally life saving surgery when I am 18. My family struggles with money and my dad does not pay child support I want to kill myself so the money for the surgery can go to my family. Paying for one funeral will be a lot cheaper than spending money on me for the rest of my life when I will never even be happy. depressed,Depression
7563,I wish it was easier than said tho Wish I could kill myself,Depression
7163,Fucking pill pushing con artists. Share your bad experiences with these scums of the Earth Psychiatry hate thread,Depression
8097,I have spent the vast majority of my life severely depressed. I have always felt like a loner desperately wanting to connect to others but with no idea on how other people do it. I recently was told my my therapist that I might suffer from childhood emotional neglect and fuck if all the symptoms do not describe me to a tee.Its hard to accept that I might have been neglected even though all the facts of my life point to it. I am having a real tough time now and I really do feel like all I need in the world right now is someone to hug me and tell me its going to be okay. All I need is someone to hug me,Depression
8219,When I read about people withdrawing during depression I read about how they stay at home etc etc.I have been struggling with depression for a long time now and recently got better but now it is back to being bad again. Ever since I quit meds it is gone this route. I hardly maintain contact with friends and have now officially decided to take a break from social media.I know this is bad but the strange thing is that I still do everything else. I leave the house everyday. I grocery shop do the dishes laundry I want to go to places like art museums and go out shopping or do writingart but I want to be alone. I am not lying in bed all the time either.For some reason I just do not want to have any contacttalk to anyone. This concerns me but I do not know why I feel like this.I am also struggling to feel emotions right now and have lost interest in what I love I seriously do not even feel human at some points which might be why I do not want to talk to people because I do not want to keep up this facade that I am interested in the conversation. Yet I am still going out and doing stuff and have some interests. I just feel totally dead emotionally? I do not know how to explain it but I am trying to pull away from the internet to recharge and whatnot.Any advice or any similar situations would love to hear your advice thank you Socially withdrawing but still doing everything else...,Depression
7002,I cannot fucking feel a single fucking thing man . I bottle up every feeling and I am so far away from everyone in my life . I have no friends or anyone I can talk to I feel like shit right this now I do not want anything in life I do not want to grow old travel make friends or whatever the fuck everyone says we should live for . I just want to end it I wish I died in my sleep everyday I wake up I feel shock and sadness . I did not choose to be born so why do I have to suffer for people who do not give a fuck about me . oh god !! just kill me nowMusic used to make me feel better it was the only thing but now even music does nothing . I cannot tell anyone about how I feel I feel stuck I cannot take this anymore . My parents think that I am very lazy and stupid so anything I tell them would be because I am m lazy . Like I told my mom n dad about how I do not find anything interest while talking about career and they said it is because I am lazy and stupid that I think too highly of myself and that I am overconfident .They also said that I am useless and would not accomplish anything in life . when actually I have low selfesteem and zero selfconfidence . how am I supposed to tell them about my depression that I have got because of neglect and abuse from them in childhood . Like I tell them that I do not feel like doing anything then they would just say it is because I am lazy you do not want to do this then you are fucking lazy and stupid I just want to die in my sleep that is the only thing I want . I feel so alone I wish I had someone to support me emotionally The worst thing about all this is being alone,Depression
7063,I turned 30 this year and I feel like I am having an early mid life crisis.Feel so old and like my life is in chaos.Lost my job last month because of ongoing medical issues.Lacking motivation to do anything.Feeling hopeless Ageing times,Depression
7808,I was stupid to believe going to the doctors would help. I was stupid to believe medication would help. I am still me. No amount of medication or counselling will ever change that. I do not know what my purpose is on this earth. I cannot hold down a job. No friends. Most of my family cannot stand me. I have felt this way from a young age and I am now 25 it is never ending. I have never really reached out for help before but I was scared that I was getting close to ending my life. it is all I was thinking of. I am told I will have to wait two years for counselling. The medication has done nothing but put two stone of weight on me so now I feel even more crap about myself. I am in a dark hole and only I can pull myself out. It gets harder to pull myself out each time I fall. I wanted to try putting my thoughts out there instead of bottling them in like I always do. To anyone else out there struggling you are not alone even though I know it feels like that sometimes. you are not alone.PS sorry if any of this is against the rules this is my first post. Also sorry for bad grammar I never finished school because of this stupid disease. I was stupid to believe it would help,Depression
8717,How do you guys fight it? I get sad sometimes and it just stays. I want it to go but it does not bother to go away. No one is there to help. Loneliness is eating me alive. Why do I feel lonely even though I have a girlfriend? I have no idea. I do not always feel lonely just sometimes ig. This sucks this really sucks. I get suicidal sometimes but that would be selfish. But I cannot see the point anymore. What am I doing with my life? I am loved I think. Just little things affect me a lot sometimes like a bullet I think. it is not fair on people who care for me if I die but it should not be like that. I wish I could just erase my existence like stop my parents from conceiving me. that would be cool. I think I am overreacting but I am a sensible person. I tried getting help but my gp never got back to me. It sucks because I got accused of that I do not help myself. I tried and I did help myself. do not accuse people who are struggling I never do that because I know it has bad implications. If you are in a relationshipdo not guilt trip your SO over something they have no control over. that is all. Take care fellas My chest feels hollow,Depression

7558,I have MDD which is already a huge thing that impacts me as well as BPD GAD and PTSD. I joined Reddit 3 days ago and since then I have had multiple messages and comments slating my appearance etc for literally no reason. I know its stupid but I really feel like shit now about myself and I know I am just going to dwell on it and things will go downhill.Does anyone have suggestions of how to get out of this mindset? I am worried about myself especially since I SH. Thank you for reading!!! Struggling tonight,Depression
8152,New to posting here. On mobile so sorry for mistakes.I have 21F been struggling with depression for about 56 years now but I have not gotten an official diagnosis yet. I do not think my parents want to admit I have it but I know I do.I did not used to feel this way. I was a happy teen for the majority of it. Things only really started to decline when I was 16. I have had ups and downs but its remained pretty consistent. However its been getting worse and worse since 2019. Even before all this covid crap.I have a nice life. I have a loving family and two wonderful parents that I love very much and who love me very much. I have some pretty great siblings too. I have a wonderful and amazing boyfriend that I met online last year and who is going to come visit me in September unfortunately its a long distance relationship. I have a great best friend who I also met online and that I love very much. I have a good job it does not pay enough at all and its incredibly boring but the family I work for is wonderful and is the only reason I have stayed with it for 3 years. I should be happy. I have so many wonderful blessings. But I am not.I have only felt worse and worse with each passing month. The depressive episodes are only getting longer and harder to crawl out of. I never want to do anything I like to do anymore. I cannot get excited about things that usually make me happy anymore. I keep having awful nightmares about feeling trapped cornered and helpless but everyone around me says Ill be just fine.I know I am loved. I know I am worthy of love. But I just feel so tired and lonely and empty. I am so sick of life.Sorry for the rant. I just feel really bad tonight and I had to vent because no one else is online or around to talk to. Tired,Depression
8031,I would like to know if you guys have ever seen your childhood before depression pic and cried with a feeling of OH IS IT REALLY ME BEING HAPPY... WAS I ALSO HAPPY ONCE? I would like to know...,Depression
8995,I do not know what to do what to focus on what to believe in what to spend my time on. The noise inside my head is deafening and I feel uncertain about everything. I question everything. I have no faith no love and no sense of conviction about the future. I just wish I knew what to do. I am so lost,Depression
7060,Last year the lack of future hope and general pointlessness of life finally got to me the cycle of disaster recovering from lifes shit then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home to just enjoy one more year of life ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year met a girl that went well for a good few monthsas far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me tried new hobbies Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad just not sustainable. Today one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymoreand quite frankly not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head I still have 2 friends but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago and although I know that I guess I did not think I would make it this far and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next 30 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me it is already in motion I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough.,Depression
7855,I am a 24 yr old male with depression anxiety seizures scoliosis and schizophrenia who graduated in 2016 and still living with my parents. Since then I have made no progress.I have realized that School was the easiest thing in my life.I had jobs but I could not keep up with it because of my mental and physical illnesses got in the way. I tried signing up for college but I was afraid of messing things up for myselfMy first dream was to become an MMA fighter but due to me having brain surgery to remove seizures I do not think I can ever achieve that.Throughout my life I was always called ugly even by friends girlfriend and family.I live in a godforsaken area where there is nothing for people my age to do I have never have had a serious relationship and I am still a virgin.Sometimes I just want to end my life but I cannot find the guts to so.Also I do not think I will be able to survive in the Real World. What can I do to survive on my own have a relationship find a new dream career and live in peace. Every since graduating High School my life is ridiculously hard,Depression
8442,I do not want student loan debt collectors harassing my parents after I am gone. The reason I want to die is also the thing keeping me alive.,Depression
8919,I am lost adrift with no hope of rescue and no hope that the future is going to be less terrible. The only reason I have not put my shotgun barrel into my mouth is because I have a wife and kids who are depending on me. Antidepressant medication is just barely doing anything and I have not had luck with therapy. I am out of options but to continue on this deadend path to nowhere. The world is headed down a spiral to mass death and doom and nobody cares to stop it. Everything is hopeless and it does not matter. I deserve to suffer because I am a member of this accursed species. I fantasize about killing myself every day,Depression
8058,I cannot name the last time that I live for myself.I live for my mom because she would be pissed if I left herI live for my dad because he is paying for my education and I would feel bad leaving when I am a semester away from graduating.I live for my roommate because I have to pay the portion for my rent. I live for my pets because no one else will take care of them.I live for my job because I have projects to do and bills needs to be paid.But I just do not live for myself. I do not find any happiness in all of this and never have. I have been hovering over this subreddit for the past four years and nothing has change.I do not know. I always hope things would change but it just seemingly getting worse. I keep telling myself with every milestone in life things will change.Well I moved out from home things got worse I have good grades does not matter to me I have a job in my industry I do not enjoy it..Not sure what to do. I am running out of excuses to keep on living. Life is only tolerable when I am drunk or high which is no way to live life.Idk I guess I will just see what happens Let me rest. I am tired,Depression
8062,Today I had a good day I quit my toxic job and received 4 calls for better jobs apart from that I sold things that I tried to sell for 2 years and made contact with old friends it was a very productive and good day week but I do not feel like that always at the end of the day I have a feeling that everything I do is wrong that it must have been better if it had not been me as if I were evil bug something that should not exist which every night goes to the same thought ..... should I still be alive?If what I feel or post does not go on this subreddit sorry in some way I think I had to remove it but I do not want to bother anyone sorry Today had a good day but not feel like these,Depression
7669,I have been struggling with depression and questioning who I am as a person for the last couple of years but it recently has been getting way worse. I wrote a song to express myself if anyone wanted to hear it. I know I am not supposed to do it,Depression
9065,I am even an outsider in my own family. I try to fit in with friends until it becomes abundantly obvious that I am not really part of the group and they do not care about methen i leave and try and find a new group. What is so wrong with me that I have never fit in anywhere in my life Always feel like an outsider,Depression
7716,I do not tend to talk to my mother about my mental health because we have not been too close over the years. we have only recently begun to have a relationship again after a falling out. She knows about my PTSD depression anxiety etc because it is all rooted in the things I experienced because of her or other family members. During a recent interaction she said she could sense I was going through a tough time and that it must be because I have never prayed to Jesus properly to take it all away. It felt so insulting because as the neglect abuse and pain I experienced as a child were happening I prayed my heart out through tears only for nothing to happen. I really am in a dark place at the moment and being told that it is my fault for not being good enough for her God has just been so disheartening. My mother told me that the reason I have trauma is because I have not spoken to Jesus properly.,Depression
8959,Sometimes my posts on Reddit seem invisible If you see this can you comment hi?,Depression
7801,I have a close friend who is chronically depressed and says he does not want to be alive. However he refuses to see anyone for counseling or treatment. Any suggestions for how I can get him to accept help and see a professional? Suggestions for getting someone to accept help?,Depression
7750,Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune which can reclaim it without our permission indeed without even advance notice. Thus we should love all our dear ones but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever nay no promise even that we may keep them for long. Lucius Annaeus Seneca Cannot find the sourceThe most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on survive and flourish without our loved ones whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember so that should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do they would enjoy seeing me again and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me I have a silly idea that maybe when the Norse Greeks Egyptians Celtics and more spoke about the idea of death and what it was to live life after because surely they did they sat around their grand tables talking of stories they heard as children told to them by their parents who were in turn told by their parents and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong and they would have led a happy content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death and made up the gods and the fantastical dragons and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again they are in Odin's hall or at Arthur's table drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if after you die you go to join them at the table and they want to hear your tales of glory would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them and how your life fell apart after they left you and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children for their loved ones and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death their inescapable cycle of life made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better have made life more fun to live. Or at the least have a good story to tell. To bring it back I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them although if you are losing them because of your actions you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them we should show our love for them. We should share our joys and try to be better for their sake if not our own.After all No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate deceitful abusive prideful greedy and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving and you will love after life,Depression
8683,TW suicideIts currently 6am and I cannot sleep. Its 6am and have not gone to sleep yet. I am too overwhelmed too sleep.I have an appointment with a psychiatrist for diagnostic evaluation in a couple weeks. My summer break is over a few days after my appointment and I am panicking. I am not ready to go back to school yet. I need a diagnosis before I go back I literally cannot function everyday of my life is living hell and I cannot take it anymore. My parents will not let me get vaccinated for covid and I do not want to go back to school where most everyone is not vaccinated. I am really worried for my appointment with the psychiatrist. I am worried that I will not be diagnosed on the first appointment and Ill have to go back to school without meds not knowing what is wrong with me.Last year I failed most of my classes and I really do not want to retake my failed classes at irl school because I am too embarrassed to let everyone know that I am failing. My pediatrician recommended that I get a tutor and a 504. I have already have a 504 plan but my parents and I know nothing about it so its doing nothing to help me. I am too embarrassed to get a tutor because I do not want to feel stupid in front of a tutor if I do not know something.I am having a really bad time right now and I am so tired but not like sleepy tired I am just so tired of feeling like shit everyday and not being understood. I feel like I am going crazy. I am not planning on killing myself or anything I just wish there was nothingness. Everyday I get worse though everyday I get more and more sick of everything and want to say fuck it. Sometimes I at least want to halfass trying to kill myself so that people will know that I am actually suffering and they will take me seriously. Idk thanks for listening bye. I am not doing too good,Depression
7471,I am a bisexual man. But I do not want to be anymore. I am trying to not be open about my sexuality because I do not want to be viewed as a predator deviant degenerate etc. I am scared of getting dirty looks or having slurs yelled at me for holding my boyfriend's hand in public.This just makes me hate myself even more than I already do. there is no place in society for someone like me. I do not want to be queer anymore,Depression
7633,I am not planning to yeet myself currently but just in case I want to know.Any sort of pill or way that can kill you with minimal discomfort?I am just so exhausted right now and I break into a cold sweat very often and I hate this feeling so much I do not want to endure it. I definitely do not want to endure it during death hence why I am asking. Are there currently any painless ways of death today?,Depression
7767,Like I do not want this life I do not want to exist anymore. I do not appreciate life and I am not grateful and a big fuck you to all you positivity only cunts who go around telling others to love life and be appreciative fuck you fuck you fuck you. I wish I could just die in my fucking sleep I do not want to live anymore but I also do not want to kill myself. Can I please just stop existing omg. I already know I am going to drag this on under I am fucking 80 years old alone and droopy and STILL be like this holy shit I need to jump down or get hit by a truck by like tomorrow I simply do not want to live anymore,Depression
8306,I would not say I have depression I have my own issues and I know a lot of people are lonely on here and so am I. I have nobody and I would rather talk to people who need it.

Willing to talk with people 1418 if you would like to talk or make a friend,Depression
8033,Hi all I went through a really bad bout of depression last year about 69 months I cannot overly remember it as it feels like a big blur. I would just be holed up in my room after I got home from work and would lay in bed for hours not eating just scrolling through my phone. I was living with two people at the time who I considered my best mates they were aware of my struggles with depression I was quite open about it with them but this was the worst it is ever been around them. Throughout those months they moved on with their lives got boyfriends promotions etc. which I am incredibly happy for them they are extroverted and neurotypical but they took my depression personally saying I was not making an effort with the friendship and that they felt like they were 'walking on eggshells' around me this is a major trigger for me. I told them several times that it was not personal and it is hard to get excited over someone else's life if I cannot even get excited over my own. This caused quite a big riff in the friendship amp I pulled back considerably because it was also setting off major anxiety for me. Because I never wanted to experience this again I started masking my depression around everyone I know. But I have noticed that when I am alone I am spiraling worse than before I feel like I am about to fall into a serious rut and I am trying to avoid that at all costs. Has anyone had any experiences like this? Am I actually doing myself a disservice by masking my depression? I am scared I might lose another 69 months of my life if I do not do something. Masking Depression,Depression
8026,I will try to make this as short as possible. I have always had problems with finding something that I like and doing it in excess not just drugsalcohol even good things. I am 25 years old I did not drink until I got to college and I liked it but did not love it. While living on campus you of I I drank often but I would not say more than any other college kid. Cocaine was another story. It came around a few times and i was quickly doing it A LOT. every night type of a lot. I was able to stop that on my own somehow. Alcoholism runs in my family although never effected my parents because they were careful. About 5 months ago I started drinking and it very quickly got out of hand. Like almost a fifth a night out of hand. Its leading to issues that have started to get worrisome. I own a lot of guns and I have started becoming somewhat suicidal. Its like alcohol woke something in me. I have always been on anti depressants. I have not seen the girl I have dated for the last 6 years in a month and she basically hates me now. I do not want clinical help I want to tackle this like I always have for everything else. Does anybody have advice on how they fixed this on their own? I am sorry if asking for that is frowned upon but I want to control this on my own. I posted this in another sub incase this is not allowed here but any advice would be very appreciated. I really need some advice,Depression
7039,A week ago my overseas boyfriend of 6 years went to prison. This means no contact for 18 months for us. Idk how I have coped honestly. there is been days where I do not feel like living and are never ending. I am young I am 17 and hes 19 but this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. We are not able to call due to me not being 18 yet and I cannot go over seas due to covid an financial situations atm. I knew it would be hard but I never thought it would be this hard. I have started sleeping all day not eating falling behind on class work and constantly cryingpanic attacks. I miss him so fucking much every single day and dread the 17 months ahead of us. there is a possibility he could get out in 12 but I do not want to get my hopes up. I am so grateful it did not hit the 2 year mark or was not a sentence like 5 years but its still so hard. It constantly feels like I do not want to live anymore but I am trying hard to hold on for him. have not felt this pain in a while. Heart ache more like heart attack.,Depression
7312,Close my eyes and count to ten Ill feel blank like way back whenClose my eyes and count to ninebring back memories of when you were mineClose my eyes and count to eight Reminiscence of that first date Close my eyes and count to sevenI only wish Id end up in heaven Close my eyes and count to six I wish this problem was easy to fixClose my eyes and count to five I feel as though I am on the edge about to dive Close my eyes and count to four Think about how you walked out that doorClose my eyes and count to three Back when it was just you and me Close my eyes and count to twoI really guess we are through Close my eyes and count to one I guess that is it I am finally done I wrote this poem interpret it how you will,Depression
7812,This is literally the first time I am opening up somewhere and not denying my miserable mental health. I am a 19 year old teen and went through a painful breakup 11 months ago. I was completely fine and confident before that a nice social group of friends that I made almost everywhere I went. People used to compliment me for my good looks and charm and it made me more confident. However after the breakup things started going downhill. I am not sure if it is the lockdown and quarantine that made me this way.I literally hate meeting people now. People give me anxiety. I force myself to attend meetup plans made by some 45 friends that are left. I feel tired to pick up calls from friends my phone stays on silent all the time. I do not open social media at all and even if I do all the messages I get are left unanswered. I cannot even do daily chores which involve interacting with people like going to the shop to buy groceries or visiting the barber. Somehow I push myself to do it. I want to join the gym and start working out again but I am afraid of all the other people at the gym. I am well over my ex girlfriend and do not feel anything about her or the breakup. But I do refrain from meeting our old mutual friends. My sleep schedule is messed up I sleep at 130 am and wake up at 1030 am. Previously I was diagnosed with migraine. Now that I stay at home all day I do not get them. But socialising or going out gives me stress migraines. I know this is not normal and I want to get out of all this. This is a genuine cry for help. About my life goals I do have a serious passion for Physics and Astronomy. But I end up spending most of my time playing video games. It would be very kind of the reddit community to help with any type of advice. Thank you. Help...My social anxiety keeps getting worse. long post,Depression
8156,I have been struggling with some sort of depressive disorder since I was probably 9 or so and I am 28 now. When I was young I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which I account for the beginning of all of this. Diabetes can be a real pain but is on whole quite manageable with the grin and bare it mentality I have developed. It took me 7 or so years to graduate university with a degree in biology I second guessed my self so often it was easier to go to bed than accomplish anything worthwhile. Relationships are taxing when I cannot numb my mind I process and realize outcomes quicker than they can become reality. Tonight I went to play trivia with friends as is usual. All of them bailed last minute but being the extrovert I am I was able to join a new group and had a bunch of fun with them. A person I would consider a crush was there tonight and after trivia I attempted to communicate with them. They ghosted me which was very unlike our previous interactions. I am stuck thinking about what all of this means in my head and the easy high of participating with a fun trivia group with the low of being ghosted is a lot to take on. I am stuck. Putting myself out there.,Depression
7802,Obv I made all these plans thinking I would be a lot better once the core stressor was removed but tbh I am still finding it v difficult to not feel low and to enjoy doing things. So I guess Ill just try and enjoy the remainder of the time without putting too much pressure on myself to not waste the time. I am finding it very hard.Anyone been in a similar situation who has any tips? Thank you Time off work due to stress,Depression
9058,I 28f am coming off of medications and quitting my copying mechanism of cannabis. I have lost all interest in life. Doing hobbies hanging out with people watching tv hell even mindlessly scrolling on reddit. I just do not have the energy to even care. Iv tried doing things to help me. I looked for places to basketball this morning but of course I could not find any open courts or just play around on. So that got me down even more. The only thing Iv wanted to do in the past week I could not and I felt like its such an easy thing. But none of the deck areas around town has courts and then the gym I was going to sign up for. Literally signing the paper work looking though the window at the court. And the desk girl was like oh btw were going to be closed for a month starting on Friday so of course I was not going to pay for a month that I could not even use. Trying to eat better to give me the nutrients to feel better but I do not even have the energy to pull out the pre made salad I bough at the store. I just want to feel interested in something again and happy and excited to do things. I know this is supposed to be temporary but man it feels so shitty and I am worried habits will form that I cannot break. Of just being a lazy sak Advice on loosing interest,Depression
7262,Hi I am 17 years old and for the past year or two I have been going through this cycle with jobs and consistency. I always want to change for the better and help out my mom and start caring for myself more and more so i eat good for a day a week start to develop my hygiene again run daily and then ill just stop. i cannot stay consistent with it at all. even with things i enjoy like video games music i cannot stay consistent with producing content on these things. But my number one problem is work. I cannot help my mom because of my mental health and it feels so damn disabling. Its been about 7 jobs where ill go through this whole process go the first day or maybe not even show up to the interview and never go back. Why? I do not know I feel afraid socially and the thoughts of the 8 hours of work drains me back to back days on top of it. But I do not understand why I cannot be like other people and just go and get it over with. I cannot do that it feels like I would rather die before go in again and that is how I feel right now 12 hours before my second ever shift at a new job. I thought things would be different this time as I did every other time but I was wrong. Please someone help me out her Its happening again,Depression
8740,You want someone to feel emotional pain?? Why?? I think that sounds wonderful if no one could cry at my funeral I would not want to bring emotional pain like that to someone especially if its someone I care about. I think that is the thing driving me from ever kicking the chair. I hate to offend but I think that is selfish to wish for someone to feel emotional grief like that have you seen someone go through grief??? Its terrible. Its ugly and painful and I would not wish it on anyone. So why would you want someone to go through that? Sorry if I hurt someone by saying this I do not intend this to be offensive I am just astounded that people genuinely think this and I want to know why? I hate it when someone says no one is going to cry for me when I am gone,Depression
8455,I have been in a rough place lately and yesterday I had a mental breakdown at work and ended up packing my tools up and leaving... now I am sitting at home kicking myself in the ass once again Depression broke my life again,Depression
8286,I have been working from home since the pandemic began and still live with parents.Since then I have hardly left the house or seen friends and feel like both my mental and physical health have been impacted tremendously. I am not very outgoing and do not have a partner so I do not really have any reason other than work or going out with friends to leave the house. But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point. Feel like life is on hold due to working from home,Depression

7698,do not know if this is relatable to anyone else but Freddie and effys relationship hits so much harder when you are also depressed and know that no one will ever understandtry to understand care and unconditionally love you as much as Freddie did for effy. Skins UK freffy,Depression
7065,I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me it will be a little long.So here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up hopeful for things to get better you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like it has been too long I break down then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time you start to get tired and lose hope but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough you get lost and do not know what to do how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much nut the last 56 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult I realised how much problems I am around that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things problems responsibilities situation future all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember everytime I work to change my life some uncontrollable shit happens that breaks me. I try to stay positive I try to not break down. Apart from this I feel alone I have never shared my problems my situation stuff I go through with anyone. Although its not like I have not tried I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen no matter what they say. Sometimes I want that one person that I can talk that one person with whom when I talk I forget about all these problems and just be with her you know. Like one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now no girl wants to be with a guy like me I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her blames her treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much in friendship relationship what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime not physically and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad every damn thing are coming back that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that I want that connection that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you if you read it. I am grateful this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane. Sorry I have to let some things out,Depression
7892,Having depression andor anxieties can fck you up so badly that it changes all the life you have now. How can you accept the things that you cannot change? Things you know will have consequences in your life things that you cannot just simply move forward and ignore because it is affecting you now and will affect you later. Nevertheless you do not have the option to act for a change because it cannot be changed anymore. How do you act upon this feeling? Knowing that no matter how much you want to improve and move forward it is already part of your life. It cannot be changed nor ignored. It cannot be glorified that it is an important part of your life because you know you are much better off without them. How do you deal with this in the right approach? How do you accept the things that broke you forever?,Depression
7151,Not sure if this is the right place for this or really why I am sharing.I 26 M have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember really. The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house a dog that we absolutely adore decent reliable vehicles decent job lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head to be able to go to work so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday. I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried. All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days if you could call it that. On those days I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly what difference! I mean I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home with keeping the house up and stuff. Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone 1200 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state. I am actually starting to feel emotions again not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story that many people will not even bother to read all the way through is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!,Depression
7769,Anyone else have immense trouble concentrating on shit? Can I ask how do you cope with it when you need to concentrate? I have clinical depression and my doctor tells me that concentration is one of the last things that improve when you get better. I do have my studies however I love my major and studying and learning new things but I just can not fucking concentrate. One of the few things that bring me joy is learning new stuff but when I open lecture materials its like I have forgotten how to read. Nothing makes sense and I cannot remember anything I read. I could not even bake a cake for my birthday alone had to have mom as help because I could not concentrate on the recipe. This fucking illness has ruined me. I used to be whip smart and very studious and had a bright career ahead of me. Now i can barely manage university courses. This fucking illness has ruined me. I have tried to be on my meds and without my meds. If I do not take even just one of my multiple meds my head just becomes so noisy and full of shit that concentrating on anything is even harder. If i take my meds the noise and all goes away but then its just the emptiness there that is keeping me from focusing on stuff. I know recovery is a long process but I am scared ill never recover or get my concentration back. I am really frustrated trouble with concentration,Depression
7647,How do i deal with my jealousy towards my closest friends they are buying houses having kids getting new jobs while still in this dead end job of which I have had for 11 years.I am now actively avoiding there happiness as i do not what to mess uo our friendship. As I am having what i consider the worse 2 years of my life.11k I am debtThought about dying 100s of times I have gained 4 stone Losing my boyfriend through deportation.But every time I have called the doctors to get help I have not had the courage to continue the call.I am struggling on a daily bases to keep it together but i just spend time crying and thinking it would be best to bot have anyone in my life as i would just slow them down.This may not be the right place for this stuff but it has felt a bit better getting these thoughts down on paperso to speak.Thanks for listening Safe spacevent,Depression
8450,I am in a place in life where I feel so numb. So tired of my toxic mother. Stupid bitch. And this constant changing of day to night and night to day. I always feel like crying inside screaming. A few weeks ago I stopped my medications due to weight gain. I am not that much obese but It feels very uncomfortable gaining weight. Doctor told me to do exercises along with the medications. But I could not follow the word. I feel so empty. Confused and irritated about people and society. But I just want to feel loving someone. Live in the fantasy of love without the knowledge of love is a fake thing. Like I did years ago. Man or woman. Completely platonically. I just want to leave home. I watch yt videos of people going to jungle and survive. It gives me excitement. But I know I cannot just stand up and walk into the jungle. I do not know what I am trying to tell here. I am just typing my feelings rn. I would not post this maybe. maybe I will post this. If I decided to post this at the end it would not be from my original account because I think someone I know may identify me somehow. I just do not know what I am expecting from you by doing this. I just need to feel calm. I have this dire feeling of leaving society. For good. I just want to go far away. I feel like I cannot trust anyone in the world. In my fantasies I would like to meet a persona man or a woman who thinks and feels just like me. Hug himher and cry until I do not have tears anymore. But I know it is just fantasy. do not know what I really want. My brain is battling over multiple thoughts at the same time. For short periods of time I feel happiness. For short periods of time I believe in real intimate human connections. Until very immediately I realize it is just fucking fake. I do not want to die. I think I am not suicidal. Onetime in life many years ago I decided to die but I could not complete it right at the point. I was afraid of sth. I had hope that things can change over time. But so far it did not. Actually I think that if things have gotten worse. I wish things change soon for better. Because it is just painful now. This feeling is intolerable. Suffocating. I do not know how others do it. the 'normal people'. I cannot put together words to describe my feelings correctly. I am confused. I feel brain fogged. I want to go to the jungle...,Depression
8785,Ita becoming a problem large tips paying for meals. The second someone is nice to me I feel like I owe them for making me feel good. I recently made 3 friends this way but then immediately left because I was taking up their time. Not sure how to get out of this headspace but I do like people being happy. I keep buying things for strangers,Depression
8873,I feel like my mental illness has completely overtaken my words actions decision making etc. to the point that I am such an entirely different person. Its like I have rewired my brain to only think and act out of sadness or worry. I overly guard my every action in fear I will ever even slightly inconvenience them. Its in every part of my life and I am lost. I have no clue who I am anymore. Completely lost,Depression
8054,sort of feel like its my fault anyway but i just got told every single day i hear something about you comparing yourself and i was already in such a shitty mindset. i want to scream cannot stop crying,Depression
9128,Wanting a relationship but being out of shape working on that ugly and no personality or real talents as well as poor means I am shit out of luck! 26 years old and i have never spent a night with a woman. Obviously more important things than sex but I am still a guy and want to experience it so not having any skill in that area sucks real fucking bad! I just cannot possibly see a good future. I am not going back to school ever so I am stuck with a hs diploma and my current job is really good and pays well for what I can get but realistically I will never own a house I will always be renting living paycheck to paycheck and it will always suck Lonely and miserable,Depression
8204,Even with consultations with a psychiatrist taking antidepressants I have no energy for anything. I feel useless I cannot study I cannot work I cannot do anything just stay in bed almost all day Sleeping almost 14 hours a day,Depression
6976,I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it but long story short I am getting better after months of medication therapy etc. My anxiety is at an alltime low and my antidepressants do not allow my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it i hate that I am getting better i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing like taking a walk laughing or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish i was given immense support from everyone my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists psychiatrists pills etc she is suffered more than anyone else even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not tried harder to get worse but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know get a new self destructive habit and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months i dropped out i started driving lessons yesterday I am eating better sleeping better I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it it makes me feel bad gross EMBARRASSED very embarrassed and its just a cycle ofI am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get but i guess i needed to vent thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??,Depression
8677,Hello anyone reading this it is 1010pm Tuesday 27th of July and I just feel like shit you know I let everyone down my family my friends I want to make a billion apologies to them for doing all these wrong things I hate myself. I cried for the first time in a long time I just need a hug man I do not even know what they feel like anymore. I have school tomorrow and just got out of lockdown today. Failed my exams from last term I am 16 and still do not have a female friend lol and I am bad at video games. I have a lot of questions and need answers I am lost in life do not know what to do do not know how to move on do not know how to get better. I need someone to guide me in life. Thoughts,Depression
7549,Life is fcking crazy I want everyone to realize how sad and weird life can get. I have been struggling deeply for the longest. To be honest I do not know why I am still going but I am hoping one day I can look back and be glad that I am still breathing. Everyday feels the same. I am constantly thinking about suicide but Ill probably never do it. Its a really sad feeling when you have no one to turn to. I am so scared of the future and where Ill be. Am I destined to be alone forever?? I have always thought it was cringe how people just rant on Reddit but here I am on Reddit. I hope I can look back on this post and remember these times. If anyone ever reads this.. know that we are looking at the same stars and moon and that you are not struggling alone. Everyday feels the same.,Depression
7061,Hello RedditI met someone recently on a dating app and we have been going steady for a week now. We are on different parts of the country and everything has been virtual. I enjoy his company and I think the feeling is mutual. The problem is there is this growing nagging feeling on the back my head that everything is bound to turn bad. I am already imagining all kinds of breakup scenarios in my head. there is this occasional feeling that he might be growing uninterested as time goes by and the fact that my brain tends to misinterpret his every word against me is not helping.The feeling is so crippling I do not feel butterflies anymore every time we talk. I feel fear.Will this ever go away? This is my first legitimate date and I would hate to screw this up. He does not know about my depression and I do not plan on telling him so big a skeleton as early as now. How do I possibly deal with this? Thank you for any advice Dating with depression,Depression
8823,How high should it be to kill you?If you are here to say something else than answering my question do not because that will make things worse.I have decided what way and have few areas in mind but I need some further answers. I do not want to screw up and end up in a wheel chair or so for the rest of my life. I get that while you jump off a bridge you probably have seconds to realise and regret what is happening but that is fine. I have suffered for years seconds is nothing to me.Is 10m 100m 300m enough? If I land in water how high? etc... Thanks How high should a bridge be?,Depression
7873,So I am not exactly capable of getting mental health help since I am in the weird bracket on pay where I make too much but not enough at the same time. I have tried for over a year very diligently to figure out what is exactly wrong since I have felt out of place since my relationship of 3 years ended it ended in 2015 I know forever ago my wife passed away a year ago and the circumstances were just to give me a fat middle finger on her way out. I do not understand where to start to begin what I am feeling but it is not happiness it is painful and it is nerve wrecking. Where do you begin?,Depression
7304,Before I really wanted to be happy i know it is not just something you can get but i was tired of being depressed all the time. At this point I do not even want to be happy anymore. It seems like too much of a mess and too much effort for something that will not even last. I feel like i have already tried so many times to be happy and none of them worked. Even when I have people that love me friends hobbies life still seemed so shit. Is this just it? At some point i just stopped attempting and accepted that I will never be happy with my life. The only way i see an end to this is suicide but I am just too scared to do that either. I also know that i will hurt some people if i do die and in the end i just feel like I am trapped here with nowhere to go. It makes it all the more frustrating that i hate being here but i cannot just kill myself . I feel like i do not even want to be happy anymore. I just want to die instead of doing anything else.,Depression
8318,I wish that I had the resources to move out and finally be happy Absolutely miserable here,Depression
8624,I cannot help it but feel jealous about my other friends moving on in their lives. they are planning and packing and ready to further their studies overseas so so far away from our home country and I am mad. Mad that they do not have a care in the world that they are leaving their friends and family behind for a few years or maybe more if they stay back there to start working after uni. I am mad that it was so easy for them to make the decision to study overseas because they are mentally healthy and can make productive and positive changes in their lives with no trouble at all. I am mad that they are excited that things are going to change in their lives while I sit here wanting to die over every little thing that upsets me. I am mad that they have no financial troubles and can afford living and studying overseas for years when it was already hard for my parents to sustain my studies in my own country. I am mad that they are outgoing enough and will probably have a great new social life there and merge with the new cultures and dating life when dating has never been a serious thing among us friends in my home country before. I am jealous that they are confident enough in their own skin to do things they want to do. I can cry just thinking about all this. Jealousy jealousy,Depression
7833,Yesterday was the straw for me. My councillor had already advised me to try them because I just keep spiralling getting a boost from our session and then it all going out the window before the next session. I do not have any fuel for the fire I think there is something biological going on. After a vicious breakup and being just unable to make any ground for the last 7 months. Struggling with the constant voices in my head minor jobs just being overwhelming have been the run of the mill.But yesterday I flat out insulted a close friend. The only one who had really been there for me. He got a girlfriend just as I lost mine. I am full of bitterness and resentment. I have always been a good mate never want to step on toes. It was completely out of character and like watching a car crash in slow motion. Trying to push people away out of fear? Out of mercy because I think I am just draining to know? I have no idea.I verbally attacked him and his girlfriend who I have never met. Even talked shit because she had a kid with some else after they split and he went running back and looks after someone elses kid.But anyway called the doctor today. Got some anti depressants to hopefully help. Really scared of losing my libido but the horniness and want for my ex has also been torture. So maybe not a bad thing? Just less on my mind hopefully. Got my anti depressants. Absolutely dreading it.,Depression
7170,My life is very hard. I am in pain all the time. I have been working on healing for years and there is been some improvement but overall I am still in bad shape. I can usually only sleep during the day. I play chess but my pain really affects my game and its really disappointing. I play guitar but have really low quality gear because I have no money. I live with my parents. I cannot work at all and my disability claim was denied. I sent it in an appeal hoping for the best. Its always hard being around my father. It seems like hes so disappointed in me and it creates a very tense atmosphere. Its easier to be around my mom but its still hard. My older brother blew up at me a few weeks ago telling me how lazy I am. He does not believe I have a disability. He was incredibly insulting. I blocked him but he apologized so I am talking to him again. Hopefully it will stay civil. My younger brother is nice but does not really understand my situation. I spend all my time either at home or at the park a few feet from my house. I tried to get gas the other day but was too anxious. I drove by the gas station and went back home. My mental health has never been decent. In 2013 my physical health began doing downhill. One issue after another. No help from any of the many doctors I tried. I smoked weed every day from 12 to 18 to try and cope with my issues. When I got sober a lot of the people I thought were my friends wanted little to nothing to do with me. College was terrible. I dropped out my senior year. Every year got harder and harder since my health was declining. Then I moved back in with my parents and it was doctor after doctor protocol after protocol. None of it helped. It generally just made things worse and Id voice this to my parents and it caused more tension. I was kicked out of the house countless times and often slept at motel 6 with the money I had at the time. I have had such a bizarrely difficult life. I have been expressing suicidal ideation since 3rd grade. I keep hoping things will pick up for me and that Ill finally reach a place where I feel stable. I have hopes and dreams. Well see what happens. Thanks for reading. All the best to you Tanner A difficult life,Depression
7456,I know...the title sounds annoying and desperate...but I really needed to tell someone anyone. This is probably a result of PMS...but I really do want someone to lay in bed and cry to. I am so touch starved and lonely. I have felt this way for years. I just want someone to hold me and reassure me. To comfort me through all the shit I go through. Sometimes the loneliness gets so bad and I cry alone in my bed. Sometimes I wrap myself around a pillow and have to pretend it is someone a boyfriend for comfort. This is one of those times. Ik after this I will get up brush myself off and get on with my life like I always do. I have to. But it would just be so nice to have someone hold me and whisper sweet nothings to me. To feel his warm embrace and his fingers play with my hair. To make me feel like I am worth protecting. Like I am important to at least someone. I am always fighting with myself internally. Ik that I should not have to depend on anyone for happiness. That I should be my own independent woman or whatever. And it is not like I am going to settle for someone who does not treat me right....and I know life is not all about love and relationships....but I just...I love feeling WANTED by somebody. Maybe that makes me needy and codependent but I just love it so much. I love being praised and spoiled with love. It hurts when I see other people living the life I want to live. Like I am happy for them...but it hurts bc I want that so badly. I want to be somebody is baby too. somebody is world. I want to be special to somebody too. Honestly it does not help that I might have daddy issues....Anyways I needed to get that off of my chest. Thanks for reading it all if you have gotten this far. lt I want a boyfriend so badly right now,Depression
7701,Just want to know how are you doing lately I am feeling like confused as hell because of my medication i think but my depression is less visible even tho i feel it behind me and it is heavy as hell. Bipolar depression is very dangerous just want to know if there is anybody who is bipolar and taking lithium like i do and how you feel about it. Curiosity you know. How r you doing lately?,Depression
7733,I bought an expensive gym membership for me and my mom. They have a jacuzzi and large swimming pool. She will promise to go with me but whenever that day comes she always says she is tired...every single time. I think before the pandemic we have only been to the gym twice together altogether out of my 3 year membership. She will not go with me. I wish I had someone to go with but I do not . I have 0 friends. Guess I will go by myself. Going by myself is so awful. I see everyone else with their friendpartner and me... all alone.. I have went to the movies by myself too because she did not want to go. Someone even asked me in the movie theater what is a young girl I am 21 like me doing alone Wish I had someone to do things with ,Depression
7504,I just want to knOw its NOT normal to be indifferent to death? like I do not want to kill myself but I would not care if I got killed. I know it sound strange it does to me and its hard to explain. I am not like rock bottom depressed like I formally was but I almost just do not care too much anymore? I am unsure of what normal feels like ? Its almost as if I either question or worry over every single detail in my head OR I have zero thoughts?? Normal?,Depression
9158,Just as the title suggests I am feeling really numb especially today. I am not sure what is left in me. I am going to be sleeping today away Losing any hope I got left,Depression
7529,I have posted here before. My problems are pretty big and out of people's hands regarding depressionanxiety. My 5 year old daughter got taken away from me four months ago. For no good reason at all. I was a great father. I raised her for 4 and a half years 56 days a week. It crushed me when she was taken away. With my depression I have been living the last four months like a apathetic hobo. Not caring about anything. Getting worse and worse. I make songs. Alot of it is pissed off and dark. it is the only thing that got me through.I got a call today from law firm and she told me that the judge granted me full custody. I pick her up this Saturday. With cops probably. I have a full band now. Instead of me being solo.I have to clean up.my act now. Clean my room it is horrible Clean myself up. My sister said she would help. Good things do happen. You just have to not give up and cannot let depression win Rage on! I have an inspiring story,Depression
8221,I am sorry to everyone that I have hurt by doing this. I cannot take it anymore every day just blends into the next with this looming sense of I am just wasting my fucking life and this voice inside me constantly putting me down. Everywhere I go and have been I have been surrounded by wonderful supportive people and yet I have never felt more alone during those moments. In these 23 years of life I have spent the past 9 just wishing and waiting for the sweet embrace of death. I just want to no longer feel alienated from the world a robot operating a meat machine completely devoid of purpose and emotion just living each day like clockwork. A feeling reminiscent of being a background character in a movie while the protagonists continue on their grand adventure. There honestly is no point in continuing on at this point because I cannot stand another day of If you kill yourself now then you will not get to see what the future holds! I have seen my future and there is no happy ending for myself just images of my cold lifeless body hanging from a rafter somewhere or floating down a river the next John Doe to be discovered by a passerby and just another statistic. So to all who saw some glimmer of potential in me or somehow found the strength to love me. Thank you I love you and please keep continuing to spread good into this world. But there is nothing that will fix this broken soul. Goodbye,Depression
7338,So tonight I was faced with a decision I could either cut something out of my life that I know would make me happier or I could continue on with it and remain how I am. That lead me to realize just how scared I am of being happy again. I was first majorly depressed last December but I got out of it and became as I would say happy again. obviously I was not suddenly perfect but I was recovering and doing so very well. Then around the end of may I got super depressed again and even worse than before I even started self harming for a few weeks. I have somewhat normalized again but I am not recovering. I am scared of recovering. I am scared that if I try to recover it will all happen again and this time I might permanently scar myself or worse. Any advice on this topic? Scared of Being Happy,Depression
8969,I am not sure if this is the best place to wrote this but last night there was a moth in my bathroom and to me the worst thing in the world is killing ANYTHING I just cannot do it and seeing it fly around just so peacefully minding its own buisness has caused me to have a nightmare i cannot explain it but i was home to loads of frogs crabs and all but instead of me killing them and putting them out of their pain i would not no matter what and instead i just let them decay in my room i do not know why but it has put me in a really bad mood and right now i do not have the best mental its causing me to be really down and depressive i do not know what this is or why but its scary and i am worrying it to happen tonight so I am going to stay up all night Nightmares,Depression
8956,Hi! I was wondering what you guys to to prevent or atleast make your panic attacks a bit milder. Because personally I have not really found anything that works for me. that is why I am reaching out to you guy in hopes of a few tips. Preventing panic attacks,Depression
7317,that is it. I feel helpless desperate and hopeless. My hair is damaged amp weak because I am stressing out I am stressing about not being stressed enough I want to be busy. I do not want to feel like this ever again. I cannot live anymore. My hard work will never pay off so I am giving up.Fuck this shit why only me? From now onwards I will never do anything. I will never work hard I will never practice I will not give a fuck about my career and future. The toll that all of this has taken on me is that now I feel happiness only when I think about suicide. No pain no sufferings No worries nothing. I give up.,Depression
9111,Ok maybe I am being stupid here but I feel like no one really gets it. I lay in bed all day everyday without a job or anything to do. My friends are also depressed but like I see such a huge difference in their life and mine. They go to work and school and are not constantly thinking of ways to die. Maybe its just me but does anyone else feel like people just do not understand and that I am just beyond hope. Thanks for reading my rant. Depresion,Depression
7079,My emotional range lately is sadannoyeddistractedself hate. I think I might have to seek medication this is awful. Just venting. I have lately been the most depressed I have been my entire life. So I thought traveling might make me feel something. I am in Libson Portugal at the moment and it sucks that the most happiness I have felt is the moment when I got an unexpected basil leaf bite of salad.,Depression
9157,I keep showing a happy face to everyone but in reality all I want in my life is to not have a life anymore. I do not want to kill myself I just want to die somehow painless... Does anyone else feels like that too? Will I ever stop waiting for my death to come?,Depression
7515,I have been depressed for as long as i can remember. since i was really young i have run away into fantasy worlds to escape my current reality. 99 of my problems stem from my family and how little my parents care about my mental well being. they do not even think the concept of mental health exists. they relentlessly made fun of simone biles recently for dropping out of the olympic competition due to stress. i cannot tell my parents about anything I am going through and even when i do they dismiss it. i do not feel like trauma dumping on a friend i love and trust. recently things have gotten bad again and i just cannot look forward to anything. i have started to hate the sport i loved for the majority of my life i have become withdrawn from my friends i do not have any expectations for the future. the only thing that anyone sees is a high achieving girl that seems to do it all. I am not smart. the only thing I am good at is disappointing my parents. the only thing I have ever wanted is to make them proud but i will never do that. what is even the point of being alive if i cannot make my own family proud of me? i wish i had never been born and i could have saved my parents from all that they have to do for me. i will never give them anything but sorrow and disappointment and resentment. i should just go drown myself like my dad says when you do not look forward to most things,Depression
9127,I am 30 years old 13 yeas ago wen I was 17 years old I got sick it got worse really quickly and 2 months after I entered the hospital I had to had operation to have an external heart support 1 month later I went through a heart transplant. Since I recovered from the hospital I have had a severe depression. I became obsessed with death the more and more I read about transplants online the mortality rate life expectancy etc nobody even mentioned any of this to me before I got the transplant. In my country the person who has lived longer with a heart transplant it is been 21 years and is all can think about. I am not a good person and I have drank a lot in the last few years since it was the only thing that helped me forget about everything for some time right now I just cannot do anything I just cannot get out of the bed I cannot fake it anymore and smile like I everything is going to be okay. I do not want to go through a transplant again neither die in pain I just want to die in peace I wish I would have died in that bed before I took this heart from someone else it could have been of better use. I just do not understand why in the 21 century we do not allow people to help them die how they want. If I were not a coward I would jump out of the window right now. I just cannot take it anymore,Depression
8810,I got the bad eating disorder. I will never be pretty,Depression
7291,psa. i do not expect a response. i would not know what to say to me either i just needed to share something i am a piece of shit. i am just a pos. i do not want to be alive i do not want to live. what is so fucking great about it anyway. you work everyday till you die you will probably endure more things that make you want to slit your wrists instead of smile. i just think its dumb. everything is just dumb. I am dumb I am so fucking stupid its not even funny. I am so fucking fucked i just want to lynch myself. i do not want to be here fuck all of you i just want to find someone my age attractive. i am so tired of having a bf 7yrs older than me when I am only 16 i feel fucking disgusting about it but hes the only person I have met in over a year that makes me feel anything. i think my ex really messed me up. why do men do that think they can bang you whenever they want just because you are they are girlfriend. honestly i want to kill my ex i hope everything he did to me happens to him amp i hope he rots in a tin fucking can for weeks i know it would not make things better but so what LMAO funny shit eh. i do not want to be alive. i do not want to be alive. 6 miserable years not a day without telling myself i should end my life. not a fucking day free from it. i am going fucking insane its day after day after fucking day wishing something would change amp it does not. it does not get better. it will not get better i am tired do not take me seriously,Depression
8466,I am probably just overthinking or some shit but its been on my mind for weeks and i just need someone to give me advice?. i mean the main thing that stands out is that if i would not be alive if it would not hurt the people i care about my mum would never recover so i could not. i never have energy my room is always a mess until i randomly get the energy to clean it i always sleep bad i catch myself clenching my teeth all the time so my jaw hurts a lot and when I am alone or in my thoughts i just feel nothing. i do struggle with a lot of things everyday like constant back pain and joint pain a lot of the time I am 19 F i randomly got the worse type of epilepsy near the start of 2020 so now i cannot get drunk with friends or on my hen night if i get married and my mum is so overprotective now i do not have one really good close friend my friends do not know half the stuff that goes through my mind bc I am worried they will chat shit behind my back like they do to other friends in the group. idk i just need to post it where people who i do not know will see it. i feel like I am just complaining now so ill shut up so ty if you read this all i think i might be depressed but i hate to talk about my feelings to people so much,Depression
7912,I am about to turn 18 and I am not ready. I never planned on getting this far living this long. That selfish desire to end it all is still there but I am too afraid to do it. I look back at 15 year old me feeling almost the exact same way and wish I would had the guts to do it then. If I had not taken years to dwell on it years in which I have acheived absolutely nothing done absolutely nothing I might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner. I felt like I have not slept in years my relationship with food is only more horrendous and the only thing that forces me outside is an exercise addiction. Whatever momentary happiness I might feel when I watch a good film or see a fox in the evening does not make any of this worth it. I have not felt true joy in so long I do not think I even remember what it means to actually enjoy life.I have completely wasted my teenage years. I have spent them inside for the most part isolating myself from people and trying to sort myself out on my own. I cut people off and other people got bored and left and now my only good friends live thousands of miles away and I will probably never even get to meet them. I know this is my fault and I should have tried harder to connect with people but I just could not. It felt impossible to hold onto those who mattered. Now I watch them all on Instagram going about their lives and having a great time and I am so happy for them but I am also so selfishly jealous. That happiness they have is all I have ever wanted. If I could throw away everything I have but be free from mental illness I would do it in a heartbeat. I am so exhausted. I do not even know what I am doing anymore. I am about to turn 18 and I have wasted my teenage years,Depression
7367,Fuck it I am totally alone. We all are no one looks at me no one cares about each other. Everyone walks around like machines on a mission. Its not worth pretending to be one of them. I should just die and let this nightmare end. I am over it all. Its all pointless and worthless,Depression
8247,Hi I am curious to know how others distract themselves from everything they are going through. My boyfriend has depression and he does not have any interests or a passion to distract him if he needs to and since we have some distance I cannot always physically be there for him to be the distraction he needs. When I got rlly sad I usually was triggered by something not always ofc sometimes i would just wake up that way. I learned to deal with that by doing something that distracts me but even when I was depressed I still had a lot of interests and things that I like to do or atleast that would distract me from whatever was triggering me. I just do not know how to help him in any other way rather than going on reddit and see what helps for others to hopefully try it out and let it be something that helps for him too. I just do not know what to tell him or what to do or how to support him since I do not know what I would have done if I had nothing that distracted me i think i would be doomed idk... What helps to take your mind off things?,Depression
8727,I cannot sleep no matter how tired I am always taking in everything and coming up with reasons in my head why everyone is plotting to hurt me and betray me and nothing has convinced me otherwise it is the most out of this world things but I am always convinced and feel like my life is already falling apart my friends are leaving my family is disappointed but none of that is happening and the likely hood is so stupidly small but I cannot shake the thought they are always there and they are so many different ways I think people want to destroy me from the inside Idk if this is something wrong with me or if I am just pathetic and people usually do the same thing I feel like I am at constant war with myself,Depression
7805,I have been pretty down lately and now I am on the fence weather tomorrow i should go see my doc or not. I am starting to giving up with my meds but i still want to be better. I do not know. Please help me. Can anybody please give me any reasons why i should continue see my psychiatrist? Really need some support right now,Depression
7351,I have been hiding my tears all day and my boss let me leave early. I thought spending close to 1k would help me cope but it did not. Now I am just home and feeling worse. I want to attempt suicide once more last time I really almost did it until my brother found me. It just brought shame and made me want to move so my family will not find my body. My only real friends are all online and I feel really lonely. At this point I am thinking of making a plan find my cat a home give away my belonging and then end it. I am done trying nothing ever works out for me. I want to be free already,Depression
8860,I am so depressed. I am so tired of living. Please help me. I do not know what to do. So tired. Let me die. I do not need this torture any more. So tired of being alive. Why is it all so fucking hard. FUCK So depressed,Depression
7543,I am overdue for a haircut and with everything going on in my life I really want to shave my head. Some unnecessary info about me I am 21F. Overweight last time I checked I was nearing 230. If I kept going with my diet Id probably be at my goal weight right now. So I am trying to do somehow lose weight again eat less drink more. Part of the reason why I added some info about me is the reason why I have not done it yet is because I am not only insecure but I dress like a guy so if I shave my head completely Id actually look like a guy. Hahaha I know it will get better but damn I have been in a slump for weeks now. Also one of the main reasons why I want to shave my head is because of the bugs. They get caught in my hair and I hate it. I have short hair already and its getting long so I am kind of tempted to get rid of it all. Plus its a good way to start fresh. I feel like shaving my head to start fresh,Depression
8110,All this work all this pressure that everyone puts on you to succeed. To go to a good college get a good job the normal things a lot of parents ask. All for what? I work my entire life and then what? Am I supposed to enjoy my ofttimes from studying or working being an ugly socially awkward loser? Not able to talk to anyone have friends even when doing normally enjoyed things video games time off etc. all I can think about is how everyone else is probably enjoying their time with other people. Am I working for something or am I just working for the sake of working just because everyone tells me that is what I am supposed to do. Do people only tell you it gets better for the sake of having one more wage slave satisfy their demand for goods? What is this all for? All for what?,Depression
8288,Everyday I see people just doing the same thing but not making any changes. I watch obese people walking into fast food joints. People just walking on this treadmill of work spend money sleep and repeat. Ever since I left the country in 2016 I have just been feeling like this place does not work for me. I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99 of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless I see alot of people doing alot of cool things and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here. I think I just have to go to Africa for a few months and be around my people. I realized that living in th US makes me depressed and I do not believe I fit in here,Depression

8980,cannot keep up anymore I am just done Last straw for me,Depression
7023,So I am 22f I have a great and supportive family and a boyfriend whom I met in University.I am in my last year of university and the pressure to figure out what I should do after getting graduated is getting to me since the pandemic started we are having classes from home so attending classes is not a big deal.The problem is I do not feel like doing anything I just want to lay in bed and do nothing. So I do not do anything which is making me guilty. I have a lot to do tbh searching for an internship. focusing on my subjects deciding if I want to go abroad for further studying if I decide to abroad the admission process and exams I need to give there is a lot going on in my head. When I sit down and try to do anything I feel anxious like I am missing out on something and thinking about the things which I could be finishing. and I end up not doing nothing and just browsing youtube for hours. I just do not know what to do I feel lost and anxious.does anyone has any advice? I feel guilty,Depression
7414,I do not know what to do please help How do you deal with constantly feeling nothing at all? i am just overwhelmed,Depression
8716,inside my head. why are there two different people inside of me fighting over what decisions i make. depressive bipolar sucks. i think i might have a personality disorder. raging war,Depression
8870,I do not want to exist anymore. Traveling and going to scenic views used to help a bit but I just do not want to wake up tomorrow. That is all. My cat is the only reason I am still alive and hes mean,Depression
8543,Doing nothing is best I can do I know I am going to be dead soon. I wanted to do something crazy or just fun before i do but I realised I do not care anymore. I do not want to do anything anymore. I do not care about having fun. what is the point of doing something?,Depression
7385,I went to residential for 2 weeks and it was amazingly helpful. It did so much to change my outlook on things. While I was gone my wife realized she can not keep doing this. I spent all of my momentum coming out of residential on convincing her to at least give us a chance. I was able to get a job only one place even reached out after I applied. It is physically wrecking my body. I am in pain every day. The pay is crap. Plus I am sleeping in the guest room which has a shitty mattress. I do not know if I can make it through this. I got home from work tonight actually feeing pretty good. My wife was out so I just lounged around for a bit. I felt like I was getting some of my confidence back. Then it came crashing down around me. I am still a fat ass unattractive. My wife told me before I even went to residential that we needed to stop with the physical in part because I need to lose weight. Before she got home I moved my shotgun out of our sorry her room and put it in my closet. Just in case. I promised her months ago that suicide was off the table that I was all in. What good did that do me? I applied to yet another job. If I do not get it I think that will be the end of it all. It will be the first time I fire my shotgun. With my luck it will not work. I can not even work up enough to care. Falling Again,Depression
7789,Why should not i end this to atleast stop this pain Next day of doing nothing. I do not have strenght to do anything. I can just lay in my bed.,Depression
8303,I have been on and off of antidepressants since I was 12. Unfortunately I have shown horrible increases of suicidal thoughts whilst on a majority of them. I have gotten to a point where I want to start the process of going back on them and I have been recommended to do so but I am more than nervous that Ill have increased thoughts again. I was last hospitalized in 2019 and I really do not want to get to that point again. My body is falling apart because of my mental health. I have gained a lot of weight I have not taken care of myself the way I need to even though I am trying. People around me do not understand it and I truly do not either.Why am I supposed to feel hope if my only chance of feeling hope is something that is increased my thoughts of ending my life?I am truly lost Medicine feels like my only hope. that is why I feel hopeless,Depression
7446,and I am having a hard time forgiving myself for the fact that I am a quiet person. I have been in horrendous situations where I feel stupid as hell for even getting myself into especially when it comes to work.. I have had challenges for years and at 29 years old it still has not gotten better. I have a social disorder and the pandemic made it worse.. I am at home friendless cannot drive jobless never had a relationship and I feel like an absolute loser for having depression and anxiety still. Its mentally taxing!!!! I feel like I am as weird as people say..,Depression
9159,I left my job to join the military. I was extremely motivated in the beginning. I am 24 and it took a year to get to a weight to be able to join. Its the hardest I have ever worked to achieve a goal. I swore into the DEP delayed entry program. Its designed to help get in better shape before basic training. I am supposed to leave in 2 months. Once I did that I lost all motivation. I stopped going to the workouts and became reclusive. I feel I am in such a dark place. I do not want to talk or be apart of anything. I feel like I should be happy working on something I want to do. There is no reason for me to feel this way. I guess i am asking for advice on why I feel this way. Left job for the military and lost all motivation,Depression
7962,I also think about going to the hospital everyday but I know that is like a temporary bandaid for me. Its a place to keep me safe for 3 days and then I am left with a 1000 bill. To me its not worth it to keep going back but I am really really struggling rn. I am drinking more and all my thoughts are about death. I am so sad. I truly want to find the motivation to kill myself but I am just so sad rn. I feel like I am tied to the wall but they are closing in and I cannot move. I think about killing my self everyday,Depression
8257,He called himself stupid. So I asked him Why do you think you are stupid? I call you smart all the time my brother is SEVEN and he said everyone calls me smart but they are lying all i know how to do is play games. I am dumb HES FUCKING SEVEN. HES FUCKING SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HES FUCKING DEPRESSED ALREADY. My parents are neglectful and they did me the same way the first time I knew I hated myself was around 9. How did they fuck up again. Fucking how. My little brother is 7 and he already hates himself.,Depression
8555,I really cannot take it anymore. I am 22 years old and have spent most of my life depressed. I was getting better I thought but now I am back to square one I feel. All my friends have been treating me like shit for so long but they never used to and I gained some self respect and now they are all turning on me. They kept on fucking up my life and making me feel like shit especially the last few months. I get blamed for other peoples wrong doings and they get away with it and then chat shit about saying how much of a dick I am even though they all bitch about each other. Whenever I try do the right thing it goes wrong all the time. The more I try to get away from them the more they claw their way back into my life. I cannot escape. I thought starting therapy this year would be good but all its done has taken away my emotion less state made me even more depressed and made me realise how much my family has fucked me up since day one. Not listening to me gas lighting me and not taking me seriously from a young age has left me in capable of human connection and I just do not care anymore. I am so alone and all I want to do is kill myself but of course I agreed to travel 10 hours to visit my sister and now I am stuck here with my parents. I cannot stand being around my family for too long and I am with them for a week. I want to tell them how I feel but whenever I try to talk to them they get mad and say there is always a problemIm losing weight so quickly because I do not eat anymore and I do not want to. I am constantly in pain and my brain just will not stop racing thoughts all day until I go to bed. I am paranoid all the time and cannot trust anyone. I have small breakdowns everyday and I just cannot keep on going like this. Everything is falling apart around me and I do not want to live anymore,Depression
7081,I am okay with dying or living but I will not fight for either. Like if I get a terminal illness Ill probably just let it be. I cannot imagine myself reaching 30 I expect that somewhere between my college and grad school years Ill just die of some illness or probably suicide but I do not really want to commit suicide because of my family will blame each other and stuff like that and also my mom I do not want to put her in a situation like that. I am okay with getting killed through natural causes where no one gets blamed. Right now I think I am okay with this nothing really matters anymore or something. Basically I do not have a will to live or a reason to fight for my life should I be in a fatal situation. I know some people feels like this too but idk what this is,Depression
8708,I have been depressed for a while and one of my comfort shows is greys. The only downside is that it induces me to be even more depressed and oh god I just had a full on breakdown. 007 if you know you know. And the way Meredith was talking like this could be your last day and be with the ones you love. Now I am feeling very impulsive. there is this boy I love. We decided to stop talking and get back together when were both mature but now I am like what if he dies. God what do I do. Do you all ever feel like this Season 5 finale,Depression
7286,I have been on various antidepressants for over a decade now since i was 13 and cannot remember what a life without them ever feels like. i have diagnosed GAD and depression and have only recently started considering the negative effects that medication may be contributing to my life chronic fatigue lack of excitement or motivation lowered libido etc...over this entire time I have been in therapy CBT talk therapy somatic and have accrued some new skills.I am incredibly intrigued by what i could be like without medication but am also absolutely terrified about what that could look like given my diagnosis and family history.what have your experiences been going off medication and instead using natural or lifestyle changes to deal with your diagnosed mental illness? what is your experience being unmedicated after being on anti depressants?,Depression
7774,I seem to be a lot happier when I am alone and being independent then when I am with them Is it possible for your family to be the reason for your depression?,Depression
8429,I hate being alive there is nothing good about my life I just want to die so I can stop feeling pain I hate living,Depression
7836,it is going to be a long one. My parents have a tough relationship and I am very used to them quarreling. Since when I am about 16 they got into a particularly big fight which I witnessed many arguments. Although they never fight physically or used foul language the way my mum talks is extremely offensive degrading and condescending. My dad tends to be the weaker one in our family and would be the one who compromise usually though not easily. I did not realize how have all these affected me until I got into university I am 21 now and lived on campus never once thought life would be so stressfree and peaceful without them.Since I am small my mum stemmed the idea in me that I must compete for her love with my younger brother and for a long time I disliked even hated him possibly because of all the constant competition and comparing going on. An example would be that if my mum and I are in an argument she would verbally express affection for my brother and make sure I know she favors him over me. Although probably my dad and my brother disagrees with her actions her longtime dominant role in our family made them turn a blind eye in these cases.Going back to my parents in the middle of almost all of their arguments my mum would definitely ask me to take a side and have to condemn my father outright. If I do not do so she would make me a villain as well and I would have to apologize or get scold at later although the matter of the argument does not relate to me at all. I hated to be squeezed in the middle of their fights and would often cry and scream for them to shut up. Very hurting words like you should just go die your dad does not want you anymore or it is all your fault still rings in my ear although years have passed after them. Probably a few months ago I found myself getting extra irritable to noises and not once I got so irritated I almost cried when a friend is talking to me though I had a long day. I also noticing having more frequent thoughts of skipping social settings and wanting to just curl up in my bed. In addition I also have stronger feeling than ever that my boyfriend would just leave me again for no reason. it is another question which I always ponder at whether I am insecure in romantic relationships due to my family or past experiences since my past bad experiences could be related to my family too? but that is for another dayThen recently I cried in a restaurant eating with my parents since they would not talk to each other nor to me after quarreling about trivial matters. Even if my mum would respond to some of my questions it would be expressed in a sour and rude manner. I just felt like I am being treated like shit for nothing. Sadly although they both saw me crying they pretended that they have seen nothing and carried on with their lunches in silence. I could not stop crying and ran away which my mother came after me saying things like why do you have to make a big fuss you did not stand up for me when I was in an argument etc. I did not look back and went straight to my boyfriend.Days after till today I still have bad mood swings that made me want to cry in public feeling empty anger that I do not know the reason of. I am tired even though I slept a lot and did not want to talk at all. I have been through phases like these years ago but never this strong. What is my problem and should I get help? What can I do in the meantime? Thanks for getting through this whole thing as english is my second language I hope the grammar is not too bad. Thanks all I think I have depression but I am not sure can anybody help?,Depression
7585,So I am about to be 23 and ever since I tired 18 my family has been against me They wanted me out the day that I turned 18 which is like two days after my graduation in with a lot of physical and mental abuse from my mom and my stepdad my stepdad would beat me about whatever else he can get his hands on and then my mom will come home if my brother and I ever gave you any lip she is fine whatever she could to hit us with whether it was a spoon and a DVD slipper a shoe there was anything she could finally get hit with it so I moved out at 18 with my best friend in high school thinking that you know we had jobs lined up with the stuff that we can do for income and in reality he move me up there because he was hoping that I would be the one to get a job and take care of them so I did that for a few months while I was in Green Bay and do with us not having food and everything I SH really really bad and to the point that my girlfriend at the time will come get me. We we had to hunt geese with rocks because we had no money or food. From there I moved to Sauk city to be with my girlfriend at the time and all she did was take advantage of me. She took all my money medications and the worst part is her and I had gotten pregnant and she made me pay for my abortion even though I wanted to keep the kid. Before the abortion she would ask me for money which I had no issue with it at the same time she was selling nudes while she was in collage. I did not find out about that until three weeks after I had to pay for the abortion. So after that I moved to baraboo with my friends and they drained 12000 from my bank account because I assumed we were going to go halfs on everything and in reality they used me for all my money. I have been homeless for three years and I really do not know what to do. Anyone please give me advise. I really need somone to help with what is going on Any advice is welcome,Depression
8130,I work six days a week. I have been since November. I have been doing lots of overtime since Covid came into our lives. I pretty much gave up on trying to finish this semester at WGU. I have experienced a lot of grief and loss this year trauma routine changes and I am having more horrible days at work than okay days. I have to convince myself daily to not call in as Id feel guilty and still not enjoy the day away from work. I am burnt out. I think its time for a new job. I miss snuggling my cat. My grandmother passed two weeks before my cat. Sold most of my stuff to move and then lost one of my good friends in a shooting in April.I am all over the place and I want to be left alone or maybe not asked to do anything else. I am too in my feelings to play video games or watch TV. I do not want to go anywhere but I know existing on the couch waiting for bedtime is not good either. I keep making therapy appointments. I schedule them for two hours later than I should finish my work shift but something always seems to come up that makes me just a few min too late to have the session. I am not sure what I am looking for here. I am just tired. I am tired,Depression
8964,I am 21m and I would think its depression or anxiety and I feel stupid because I am not the brightest guy around it feels as though I am judged Id self medicate wit alcohol or weed which would give more anxiety but my doctor gave me lexapro amp I do not think it works. idk it does not help because I am alone and it does not matter if I am having a good time it only matters when it ends because I have nothing that is interesting which is being alone and thinking about dying is scary and unavoidable so being alive is scary but I want to be better so what if I do not have the option too be better. I am depressed and I do not know how to handle it..,Depression
7556,I am trying to improve trying to find my idiot brain. And no matter what my parents are always angry. They do not let me leave the house they yell at me for not doing chores and then yell at me for doing too many chores when I try to help. I know my dad never wanted me and was pressurised by my mum but its not my fault hes a pussy with no spine. His problem that he has no conviction little prick.I honestly do not have the energy to fight my brain and my parents at the same time. I want to just live the supreme party life try every alcohol buy some hookers and take loads of drugs and die of overdose. I will not have to deal with this shit anymore because its not worth it and I can go out having some fun at least. I am giving up on trying to get better. Want to just take my parents money and spend it on alcohol drugs hookers video games junk food and send myself to an early grave from overdose or something 18M,Depression
7987,Headline says it all not going to go into detail because its pathetic. Why am I so hard to love? I am way too ugly andor pathetic. At this point I do not even want to believe it anymore. Even though we made fun of each other all the time and recently been sexual. I have always thought how perfect and great they were. Even now I respect him too much to even bother for an explanation or anything. I really hope I get over this and I hope his life gets better too since I know his struggle too. I wanted to be his best friend but I know I cannot since I have always wanted something more. I just need to stop being in his life for both of our sakes Getting rejected after confessing your love from childhood fucking sucks,Depression
8961,I am bored. I am unhappy. I am alone. The quality of the earth is declining rapidly. I want out. I do not want to be alive anymore,Depression
8933,So the problem with me is that I have plans for everything I am pretty mature for my age not telling my age. I have plans for everything the place where I lack is executing it. It happens everytime with me. This is the reason I am depressed. I know that depressed is not the correct word cuz I know that the pain of other people is way more than me. But it is ruining me. Can you guys help me. Thanks in advance. An unusual problem for an unusual guy......,Depression
8495,Without writing an essay i feel like my recent depression spanning over about 34 months has completely been eroding away my personality recently I have stated to feel a sensation i would describe as numbnessI can still easily interact socially and do the essentials work college etc but my experience while doing these recently seems to be different to how it was when i did not have depression.Does anyone else experience this sort of thing a slight decrease in a Sense of reality or you just do not feel like yourself at all.My theory is i seem to be living in my head way more and my negative thoughts are affecting All areas in my life now. Man it sucks How to recover from personality erosion,Depression
8050,Just as a gentle reminder when it comes to mental health At the top of their games and at the height of their powers Barry Sanders retired Rob Gronkowski took a break Michael Jordan took two breaks Calvin Johnson retired Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open Mike Krzyzewski took a breakleave midway through the 1995 season and did not come back until practice the next year. Andrew Luck retired at 29. Bjorn Borg retired with 11 Grand Slam titles at the age of 26. Today it was Simone Biles.Mental health needs to be treated and looked at like any other injury in every aspect of our society. In sports our jobs and especially our schools. A reminder about mental health.,Depression
7494,Hi I am early 20s M in Scotland and I have been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relateempathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadnessdepression and loneliness consequently which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of selfdoubt about myself. The relationship was quite oneway I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. There have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadnessIt's been a really hard time and I have been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. I have been paying for expensive private professional helpcounselling recently that i selfreferred myself to try console me through it but I think at the end of the day I really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. I do not really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoorsvague i know and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. I have tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. I do not know the best way to meet new people these days? in Scotland? Especially at this ageI appreciate it is a lothuge ask the amount I have went through just gets so overwhelming to process and I am just so lost and want guidance i do not know what to dowhere to go. I guess it is just so hard to see the wood for the trees and I do not know what to do and cannot see how things will get better. I feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve which makes me feel more hopeless. I want to get out of this rut I have been in for so so long and to feel lovedvalidated again and feel good about myself again as cheesy as that may sound. Sorry for a lowpost I do not like putting it upon people Crippling Loneliness after grim breakup,Depression
9020,I have rewritten this like two or three times I do not want to say to much or to little but I am losing my mind over my brother I cannot stop thinking about if hes drinking or not he finally admitted he has a problem about a month ago and agreed to go to meetings we have no money for rehab or anything like that and after months of getting zero sleep and losing over 20 pounds worrying about him I thought that everythings gone back to normal until today I am pretty confident hes been drinking me and my dad work during the day this whole thing the last 6 months has really just fucked me up I hate coming home cannot sleep I just feel empty inside I feel like I got no one in my corner and I am sorry if this comes off as me being soft or weak I just have no one to talk to and had to finally get this off my chest My little brothers an alcoholic and its slowly killing me,Depression
7125,reccently i read over some messages between me and a previously close friend from a few years ago. during the messages i was going through a depressive episode and we were talking about it together. however the messages i sent were kind of toxic and i was being very unfair. she was trying to help me and i would reply with k or refuse to say what is wrong because it does not matter. i would also send worrying messages and then not reply for long periods of time which would make them very anxious. i do not want to be the person i was in those messages normally i would consider myself to be a kind and friendly person and id like to think that I have somewhat improved in the last few years but I have been noticing that during depressive episodes i have a tendency to regress to this blunt and rude way of speaking to people. i know that depression means you cannot feel as much for the other person and it definitely makes you feel like no one else cares but i do not want to use it as an excuse and continue to treat my friends badly. a lot of the time i do not even realise I am being like this until afterwards but I am appalled by how I have acted. i would appreciate if anyone has any tips to get themselves out of the nobody cares about me attitude or any similar experiences.many thanks my depression makes me into someone i do not like,Depression
7931,i feel stupid I am not good at academics anymore i used to have a lot of friends but i have zero now i cannot even get up to go shower or go eat and all i do is hop on the game and play to lose and I am fucking tired of waking up with eyestrain headaches. my boyfriend does not like me my best friend went to rehab my other best friend moved an hour away. i lost everything and i know I am young and everyone says you are still young it WILL get better but it never feels like it does and everyone in my grade is moving on and I am being forgotten everyone else plays sports old friends from my middle school are in the council they are cheerleaders and I am such a loser because i do not do anything. I am not good at anything everyone else has a hobby but i have actually zero and I am pathetic and fucking dumb and i wish i could have the balls to kill myself but i cannot hurt my parents and I am too pussy to even hurt myself but I am stuck in my head I am hardstuck in life just like I am hardstuck in valorant and i cannot move on and i have no friends to hang out with and i just want to not exist i wish i were never alive in the first place to suffer. i do not want to go back to school because its going to be the first day of high school and its terrifying and i cannot take it walking alone in the halls and eating alone in lunch i lost everyone i ever loved because of my self sabotaging bs and its not their fault I am fucking annoying. i wish i did not care and i wish people on instagram did not post themselves going out all the time it makes me sad and i just hate how I am a no life. no one likes me so many people blocked me and i do not know why and my only friends are online and it does not count I am so jealous of everyone else andi wish iwere my old self. I am not pretty enough to have someone that will actually have a crush on me. i need to leave so bad. i wish i were still popular like my old self and life does not feel worth living without friends. nothing feels worth it anymore. cannot handle it anymore,Depression
7815,I have been working 7080 hour weeks for the past 10 years. A few months ago I went off with depression and anxiety. I know I am completely burnt out. I get really good days when I am with certain people like my parents or my brother but when its just me and my 7 year old daughter I feel so down and I am just exhausted with life. Its a struggle to even get up each day and when I do get up its only to lay on the sofa doing bugger all. My house has become a mess and my daughter although she says she can see I am happier already can still see that I am not fixed How long does burn out last or is this depression? I am seriously considering asking for medication even though I am SO against putting any drugs into my body. I just need a happy pill or a caffeine cannula! Depressed or burnt out?,Depression
7318,At the point I am at in life I could not really care if I die in 1 hour or a few days. My life over the past month has just been getting worse and worse which fueled by alcohol do not help. I still care about those around me but I do not see the point towards why I am here and why I have to be here. It just seems pointless and a waste of time and seems like a form of punishment. Just feel shitty and do not care anymore,Depression
7097,I have not felt good in such a long time. Sometimes i feel sad and sometimes just nothing just numb. What should i do? How can i regain my will to live?,Depression
7400,Does anyone else feel like this?My childhood was terrible. Both my parents were addicts I was an only child who was bullied all throughout school I was molested I was in a traumatic car accident because my mom was driving high on Oxys. She died when I was 18 I lost contact with my dad because of his addiction and 4 of my long term relationships have been abusive.How the fucking hell am I supposed to believe that life will ever get better? I literally cannot even imagine it. It seems like an impossibility. Its impossible to imagine that my life will ever be good because up until now its never been that way.,Depression
8032,I have always suffered with depression but around 2019 it is gotten a lot worse I do not properly take care of my body I do not brush my teeth I do not wear clean clothes I barely shower I cannot even sleep in my room anymore because of how disgusting it has become and how sad it makes me to be in there so I now sleep in the living room and spend all my time there then my older brother constantly reminds me on how lazy and useless I am even though he knows I have gone crying to my counselor because of the things he says about me then my friend recently sent me a screenshot of him telling my friends how lazy I am and how I am lucky he cannot slap the shit out of me idk what to do anymore I feel like such a disappointment to my family I feel like such a useless person sorry for the bad grammar I have dyslexia,Depression
8977,Nothing helps. My life is fucked up beyond any repair. I will never be happy because aspergers are not meant to be happy. I hate everything. I hate myself my family my girlfriend and my shitty future where I will end up working 12 hours a day only for it be with my fat girlfriend that treats like a man child 247.I really wished that I died on my last years suicide attempt. I hate my past my present and my future,Depression
9118,Hi all I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mindnumbing television alcohol and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there lt3 Being afraid of being alone is totally normal. The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seenheard in the way you need to be seenheard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the samesimilar thing. Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are what they value how they talkact etc. what is the difference between that and growing selflove amp selfrespect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way. To feel less alone meditating for 5 minutes a day journaling and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me that I learned through my spiritual journeytherapy is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions you will be surprised what comes out. Start some hobbies anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember you have time. Over time you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want recharge and protect your energy from people. We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says I am so ugly or I am so fat or I am so worthless we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative selftalk we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you lt3TLDR I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video first I tell you my story then I go into the prosbenefits of spending time alone and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time. Friendly suggestions for anyone who feels alone lt3,Depression
7766,There is so much behind this but how do I cope with the sadness? it is just this deep gut wrenching heart twisting pain and sobbing that I cannot control. The pain does not stop. I have to somehow go to work in a few hours Last night my husband said he is not sure if he wants to be with me anymore.,Depression
7632,Please do not lecture me I feel bad enough as it is.I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety approximately 14 years ago. For a long time I did well. And then about 10 years ago I started to slip again. Change of meds going off going back on and multiple changes of jobs because most of them have been temporary.For quite a while at different jobs no matter how good it is I start calling in sick. I get migraines so sometimes that is the problem. But sometimes I just cannot get up. It feels too much to go to work.I do not know why I do it. Its ruining my life. Id like to work and have an income.How do I get over this? Calling in sick all the time,Depression
7866,I had been very anxious about certain aspects of my job and have been avoiding it for a long time.I was being paranoid and let my fear because me to freeze in place.Well today I overcame that fear and said fuck it. I checked emails and replied to my customers and now I am getting back into the groove of work.I was depressed for months unable to even stay awake. I slept 12 hours a day for nearly 2 months. I could not break out of that rut.I am not even really sure what changed today. Maybe it was anger. Maybe it was accepting that I hated how my life was at the moment and I was done staying in place day in and day out.But I wanted to share an encouraging story. Sending you all strength. I hope you find the strength to make it through another day and get even the smallest task done.If you do make sure you give yourself a good pay on the back. Proud of you for getting out of bed. For brushing your hair and teeth. For making that phone call. For cooking that meal. I did some good things today depression victory,Depression
8671,Have been on the bathroom floor unable to breathe from crying so hard. Its just not worth it I mean nothing and am so unimportant Want to die,Depression
6974,Did your depression start after a time of serious stressanxiety? If so this may be why you feel so disconnected. After times of intense stress where we do not give ourselves any leeway or breaks our body naturally will downregulate hormones to essentially force us to stop what were doing. So we may have super high levels of glutamate and norepinepherine keeping us in a stress response but low levels of dopamine keeping us in a depression and the high amount of anxiety neurotransmitters because us to feel both depressed and depersonalized freeze response If you feel disconnected from reality this may be why,Depression
7205,That feeling came back. You know the one. It feels so cheesy and lame when I really think about it. All the darkness sadness the self isolation. Is this really what I am now? Is this who I have become?I choose to believe that somehow things will get better. I think that is my downfall. Instead of taking the steps to move forward I sit and wait for things to get better. Of course they never do. Is it my fault though? Or is it just something I cannot control? there is so many things that I do not know. In general and about myself. It terrifies me. Life is just terrifying I guess. That feeling,Depression
8328,I do not know what to do with my life anymore. I feel worthless to almost everyone I talk to including myself. I just do not know what to do. I have tried many things to find some joy but most of the time it gets ruined somehow. I think I got too good at putting on a smile. I try to get joy out of so much different things. Just look at my profile and history. I try to distract myself from my life and like that I am now very easy to distract. My family mocks me all the time at how much time I spend on my PC. But all I am doing is distracting myself from my real life where I do not know what to do with myself. When I lay in bed or do not have anything to distract me I think almost immediately of suicide or harming myself. My family has not noticed or just do not care about my feelings because I should be thankful to the good life they give me. I have a little brother and he gets out of everything somehow it is literally the cliche of having a little brother who gets all the attention. He is 2 years younger than me. I do not like my sibling hate him more than anything. I try to be a good son but I just cannot unter such conditions my brother annoys me almost every minute of the day and after some time just dealing with it I got violent. Now after some years of back and forth he is not going to stop and I do not think I cannot handle my anger. I have some anger issues because of him and my parents hear my side of the story but do not care. I have not injured him more than blue marks he never bled because of my violence but I have considered injuring him seriously just out of rage but I luckily could prevent this till now I do not know what to do anymore. I am afraid of myself. I cannot handle all this stress anymore. I cannot think clear without crying or raging. Is something seriously wrong with me? Hi please help me M 15,Depression
7988,All my life I have always been so quiet and boring which made a loner in school. It sucks because I have such a boring personality and I was never able to fit in and I hate it so much I hate being like this. I cannot do much of anything anymore my mind is so empty and its so hard. I just want a place that feels like home I will never have friends,Depression
7298,So I have literally not done an entire course's worth of work and I am most likely going to fail this semester if I cannot turn in the homework by the end of this week but I have not worked on it even a littleI do not understand why I cannot get anything done and yet I continue to do it I always am just in time for appointments just in time to get to work and barely late for assignments. I cannot seem to get a foothold no matter how hard I try to because no matter what I am barely scraping by. I have no free time because the rest of it is filled with worry.I work part time and do school full time and it makes me want to die not only literally but figuratively as well. I can literally feel the pain in my soul when I put off the assignment the quiz the test and eventually the class. It hurts so goddamn much you would not believe but then I go ahead and just do it to myself again.I see it as something almost akin to climate change as depressing as that sounds. Like the worst part about this inescapable loop is that it is inherently completely avoidable if I simply did the work. But I cannot bring myself to do it so I do not know what to do and every second of inaction is another assignment missing so I am watching my possibilities burn with fear as I stand like a deer in the headlights. ampx200BI am powerless to my inability to work and I cannot strive nor see myself striving to do anything other than work. Help I am going to fail my classes lose my housing and my life,Depression
8673,Anyone find cycling phenylalanine and 5htp daily is a great way to remove depression? My depression has recently been bad and libido too. I find phenylalanine can really deliver motivation and a good feeling however it can easily become unbalanced if not mixed with 5htp. It has been a while since I did this but today feel reallly motivated after dlphenylalanine will go up to at least 2000mg and then later tonight will have 5htp if feel the need. Phenylalanine and 5htp great for depression?,Depression
7445,As much supportive as my bf is with my depression its so fucking scary to tell someone that would never do this that if it was possible to kill myself painlessly I would. I think I got to the conclusion today that my life is not going to get better if I do not admit this. However it feels like such a selfish thing to do bc I do not him fo worry all the time and this to mess with his mood. I feel like I am selfish with everyone for not caring bc I am so depressed and then I also feel like its selfish if I tell someone that I would like to die bc of the burden I am putting on them. Please help me by saying how you told someone you felt this way and how they took it.Note I am aware that I need a psychiatrist and probably taking meds How to explain to someone your suicidal thoughts,Depression
8579,No matter how hard I try to turn my life around I lose. Dissapointment is all I have ever felt. I am so close to just giving up on this living thing Will things ever get better? I need someone to tell my I have to live right now.,Depression
8270,Any tips to get over the random overwhelming waves that hit hard? Tips,Depression
8433,I just moved states with my partner they had a great job offer and I am still finishing my masters so we headed out with plans Id get a bartending gig. And I did for about a week before I was fired for not being a good fit. The wording definitely stung. I immediately spiraled panic attack going wide with my failures cannot keep a job cannot do anything right etc. My partner was great and supportive but its hard to crack that nagging voice of worthlessness in the back of my head. I am good at my job so being fired for what I can only assume is a dislike of me in particular feels... devastating. I want to be a writer. I am working on my thesis for my masters. Yet losing a job I have had for less than two weeks has leveled me and its hard to see any value I bring to my relationship society etc if I cannot keep a fucking bartending gig. Fired while Depressed,Depression
6988,I have felt this way for so long I have always assumed it was normal not so much that I was necessarily sad but more often just numb? Like I never really feel joy or excitement although occasionally I distinctly remember the occasions I have noticeable sense of peace that cuts through my general sense of heaviness. I am not sure if this depression and I have not wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. I think I am having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events previous abuse climate change corruption realizing you likely will not grow up to be what you thought you would be the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc or if that is a distinction that even matters? Depressed?,Depression
8666,I am a wretched mess. I find myself to be a terrible fucking person. I started to feel better since a few months back but right now as of the 27th of July of 2021 at 735 am in the morning I am doing worse. I want to just take a shitload of tylenol and hope that I am not the 60 of people who experience pain during liver failure.I promised my girlfriend that I would get her help. Shit I got a panic attack brcause I could not get her an online meeting with a psychiatrist that could help her as soon as possible. I promised her she would be happy again soon. I promised her I would stay. I promised her that she would get better. But she is not. She is not getting better.I am the one making things worse she cannot see it but I am. The most recent argument left me devastated for no fucking reason whatsoever apart from me realizing that its not something else that is the problem. Its not that we both have problems. Its meI am the problem.I want her to be happy and find someone better than me. Someone that will not use manipulative tactics without realising. Someone who will be able to trust her again easily even after breaking my trust once. But I broke hers for the better and that ended in a dumpster fire. All I leave behind is chaos. The bad kind of chaos. I need to pull out the weed from the flower patch by the root so it will not grow again. I dom't want her to come with me. I want her to find someone better than me after I am gone if I find the courage to take more than two pills of tylenol and live those dreams we had with a proper man that will take care of her and can take care of her. I am sorry Margarita. I am sorry that I have done all of this to you. I love you. If anyone can help please do but I want her to let go so she will have less suffering pain and toil than what she is currently experiencing with me.

7475,I just watched an early 2000s movie and I feel more depressed. Last time I watched it life felt so alive and real. 20 now and everything is just lifeless. Generally did not think life would be like this. Just sharing,Depression
8081,Why do not women like me... it is been years since I have been touched I just want someone to hold my hand again to tell me they love me... I want to be kissed again I miss being touched,Depression
8520,it is been a bad year for me it started back in December when I ruined my relationship and lost my job but I kept going. I had a new job the next week and I was going through the motions staying busy. Then in February I had an accident at work and I have not been the same since. I have been to multiple doctors visits and lots of physical therapy but I am still not better. My job offered me a light duty position sitting in a corner alone staring at a wall and I did that for a few months hoping I would get better. I have not healed I am still going through physical therapy and I feel useless. About a month and a half ago I gave up I stopped going to work and I have probably left my house maybe 5 times for supplies other than that I have been in bed. I have no motivation to get anything done I have no drive. This is all new to me I do not feel anything really. I am not sad I just have never been one to not do anything I have been active my whole life. I am not sure what this is idk how to snap myself out of this and get back on track. Sometimes it hits me hard and I see what I have become but for the most part I am completely numb. I am going to end up homeless soon if I do not get it together bills are piling up but even that will not motivate me. Idk if I am even posting in the right sub or not I just had to get this out. I am not sure but I think I may be depressed,Depression
8189,This may be long so I apologize. I am 29F married and a mother. Let me begin by stating my husband is about as supportive as he can be and my child is incredibly understanding. All this aside my depression and manic episodes are beginning to get out of control. And I honestly do not even know where to begin and truthfully my story is not one really worth sharing. I feel as though this deserves a disclaimer that I do not feel right sharing my sorrows as I see myself being more fortunate than others. But I am so lost that I feel this need to post something rather than continue hovering over this sub and other subs related to mental health depression and anxiety. Currently I am on 20mg of Lexapro and 600 900mg of Gabapentin per day. My father was an alcoholic and my mentally ill mother suffers from bipolar disorder depression and classic narcissism. I was raised in an extremely religious family in the Biblebelt of USA. My entire life up until 16 was immersed in the Southern Baptist culture. My parents divorced when I was 4 and I did not see my father for 17 years. During my upbringing my mother and father managed to marry 6 people between the two of them. Somehow during the later years my fathers 3rd wife managed to get him sober. We reconnected when I was 20 years old and 9 months pregnant. I suffered for years from mental and physical abuse by the hands of my mother and her 3 husbands between ages 418. Needless to say my life centered around their instability. I was the oldest and therefore inherently responsible for my younger siblings. Being in a violent home the anxiety I suffered was not acknowledged. I was the girl in school that everyone knew had a rough home. My friends were my escape and still today remain my chosen family. But the fact of the matter is they do not truly understand my situation. I gravitate towards people who are not nearly as jaded. I leaned on my friends parents for guidance and empathy. I have always been the black sheep of my mothers family. I am creative incredibly artistic intelligent charismatic and I am not sorry about it. However my family views me as strange and always have. I was always told how much I looked and naturally acted like my dad someone they hated my entire life. I have absolutely nothing in common with my mother or her side of the family and frankly I am extremely resentful. We rarely speak unless its a holiday. I refuse to have my child around their toxicity. My mother is on her 4th husband and just as manic as ever. My father who I had so much in common with died from alcoholism in 2017. After years of sobriety he lost his film business and drowned his sorrows tenfold. His death was gruesome. He died alone in an old farmhouse during the August heat in North Carolina. His body rotted for 9 days before anyone found him. I can still smell him today. His death destroyed me. After years of separation from my father due to his substance abuse I was so happy to have him back in my life. But he suffered from his own mental health issues and lost himself. I miss him every damn day. Fast forward to now. My husband and I have been together since 2008. Our child is 8 years old. I promised myself that I would NOT repeat the cycles of instability and abuse with my own child. I am proud to say I have kept that promise. My husband and I have always put our kid first including making the decision just to have the one child in an effort to provide the best life. we have done it all. We bought a house in the suburbs of a great small town we are part of the community provide a great education we are not religious and we make sure that our child has an active lifestyle both in and out of school. We both work full time and I am a part time college student. Our vehicles are paid off and our debts are very minimal. Life is great right? Here is where my own mental health issues come to light. I suffer from clinical depression and panic disorder. I see a physician regularly and have been on my own medication for a little over a year. My job is incredibly stagnant and in such a toxic environment. Every day I dread this job. I have been there 5 years. Now that I am educated and have consistent years in a particular industry I feel confident moving onto a better paying position and hopefully a better workplace. I have been job hunting for four months. The job market is terrible and the competition could not be higher. I have never been so rejected in my life. My car is beginning to fall apart and I cannot afford to fix it or purchase a new one. My studies can be overwhelming at times and my professors this summer in particular have been hard on us. I have a number of hobbies including a podcast and I am so lost. My depression is so out of control. I have no family support whatsoever and I feel like I already lean so much on my husband. I am scared to lean more for our marriage will break. I write this because I am scared my kid is beginning to notice. There are days where I can barely get out of bed unless it is for work. I wish so badly that I had my dad to call. He had his issues but he got me. I feel like antidepressants only help me so much. Some days I just sit in my car and think I could just smash this into a concrete wall and it would be over. I feel like I am a rat in a cage getting nowhere. I have been going through recruiting hell trying to find a new job. I have had many phone interviews several in person interviews and I am either over qualified or qualified except one detail they are looking for. I cannot win for losing. Perhaps this is more of a venting post. Am I alone in this? I have always done a great job of putting my own issues on the back burner pushing through the pain and laughing to keep from crying. But these last 2 months have made me realize that perhaps that was not the best avenue. This is the first time in my life that I cannot escape my depression and my manic episodes. Intrusive thoughts are ever present and beginning to worsen everyday. I cannot brush them off and feel so out of control. I just want to run away. Feeling out of control.,Depression
8736,You ever just get out of a super anxiety inducing situation and just have a depressive episode and your too afraid of opening up and talking about it to anyone because you do not want to seem like a needy freak? Well I do. Or you want to vent to someone but do not want to scare them away. One of those nights.,Depression
8365,I am so proud of myself. I finally got my butt back into therapy after struggling for the past three years and was diagnosed with severe depression no surprise I just think I did not want to hear it. I am finally being consistent with getting help since this therapist is a great match for me. they are smart quick witted and good at calling me out on my bs and getting me to reflect on my own thought patterns. While I still do not feel better I feel more hopeful and I am grateful. I have started to enjoy life again. I have taken it upon myself to finally start making healthy changes in my life to recreate a headspace that invites more positive thoughts. Some things I have done the past few months to force myself out of the comfort of my sadness I have started journaling again. Every morning I try and write down one thing I am grateful for in my life. My therapist also recommended I journal every time my mood plummets so I can get it off my mind and on to paper. I quit vaping. Vaping was a terrible crutch I used to aid my anxiety it was not an easy quite but its been a couple months now and it feels good to be free. I started reading again. I replaced my phone time at night with books so I can get away from social media. I am extra proud of this because its been years since I have read for pleasure and I forgot how much I loved it. I just finished my first book since starting again and I hope this is something that I can keep up. I started learning how to reach out to friends and family when I am having a bad day. Swallowing my pride was hard. I believed I always had to be 100 happy all the time so no one would ever worry about me or think less of me. I am grateful for the support system I have. To everyone who is still struggling I hope you are able to get the support you need. Depression is nasty but I hope you find someone or something to help you bear the weight. I am proud of you for living. I wanted to share my small wins amp progress ,Depression

BYE REDDITlife is a gift at the same time is a curse. that is cool very cool!,Depression
7108,I am just here right now because I do not want to be alone. I am alone. And I am so tired of hurting. I cannot do this. Alone,Depression
8540,I am so sick and tired of everything. Everything drains my mind. Whether I am momentarily happy or sad. Nothing satisfies me anymore. I have lost interest in the shows I used to watch I make music but even that seems bleak and pointless at the moment. I cannot get myself to commit suicide but I really wish this life comes to an end. When I walk down the road I wish that a vehicle runs me over. When I am riding my bike I wish I come across an accident and die. When I sleep I wish that peacefully pass away. I do have aspirations and goals in mind but honestly I do not think I have the mental capacity to endure through. I wish I had what it takes to take my own life.,Depression
8322,I just want to type this all out because I truly do not know what else to do right now while I sit here contemplating everything. Basically TLDR my wife has now given me an ultimatum of being in a poly dynamic or we split up. I love her so much and she had alone given me so much more meaning in life when I met her and made me such a better person. I do not want to be without her no matter what that means but I want her to be happy too. Earlier this year she had been talking to an online friend about the idea of being with him and wanting to and started talking to me on the side bringing up what if we opened our relationship up and went through a lot of emotional and devastating talks about this and I was horribly depressed for months and even suicidal. Eventually she stopped talking to him at all for other reasons and I went to a psychiatrist because I have always had pretty severe depression but did not want to take medicine for it and had finally broken down and wanted to try it as a last resort type thing like what if it really did all come down to a chemical imbalance. This surprisingly worked with no downside whatsoever and we talked more and more about the possibilities of being poly and I did a lot more researching and talking to people I knew who were in that lifestyle and agreed to give it a shot and thought that I actually did want it and it would be ok. I had been dating a girl for a little while and we have done sexual stuff and she was kind of dating this guy and they had not done anything serious. I noticed that when I did stuff with the new girl it just did not feel great for no reason whatsoever and I kept brushing it off as me being anxious over this new lifestyle. Yesterday my wife had finally told me that her and the guy she was dating did sexual stuff and at that moment the one that I had thought about so many times to try to prepare myself for and thought I was for sure ok with I absolutely broke down and told her that I cannot do this. None of my experiences with others have been good and I still cannot truly fathom how people can live this way. I just want her to love me and everything go back to the way it was before. Today while at work she sent me a wall of text essentially saying that I was the problem and that she is going to continue being poly but in the same breath saying how she loves me more than anything which makes zero sense. But it came down to we either stay poly or we split up so I do not see how she could love me more than anything but still prefer to divorce. Anyways I told her that I guess we are going to divorce then because she basically made the decision already but I truly cannot live on without what I had before. I truly felt like I was in heaven being with her all these years and was ready to tackle anything the future had but now thinking about being without her I am just ready for the end. I would love to do something that was more peaceful and painless like the exit bag method but it is now too time consuming and I want to be done soon. And if you read all this way through then understand that I know this has been all my fault for agreeing and getting involved with it and breaking down after hearing her. I am not blaming anyone else but myself for this I promise I just want out and she can live her life happily. Also also I know I have posted things in here before and obviously I got through them majority having to do with the earlier in the year issues that went away and I got on medication but this is different. Things are actually ending in my life and I cannot deal with it. Anyways I think this truly is goodbye. I think I am finally going to do it long story,Depression
8865,so I started medication about 1.5 months ago and I have noticed my anxiety depression and OCD have been starting to get better but my brain feels so empty without these thoughts and I find myself trying to force myself to be anxious or depressed at times. Am I crazy? Sometimes I feel like I am not truly Ill and am just doing it for attention because a truly mentally ill person would not want to force these thoughts. I do not know. I hope I am not the only one who feels like this. Comfort in anxiety and depression.,Depression
8950,If I end up lying down in my bed for the majority of the day sometimes I think about how small I am compared to space.There are billions and billions of galaxies. There are a whole heck of a lot of stars in space out there too.Compared to me space is too large. So who cares about a tiny human like me? I have got a finite number of years to spend yet I am spending every waking moment not having enough energy to move.Strangely enough the thought of things that matter much more than my life motivates me to move and do things sometimes. Nothing really matters so why should not I get up for once? What helps me,Depression
9059,Hey kind people I randomly came across this sub and something hit me. I have been struggling to adjust after moving to a new city for the past few months wake up tired every morning even if I go to bed early and sleep most of the day when I am not working or have school. I have zero motivation to do anything I used to enjoy. All my future plans and the things I was working hard towards just do not really mean anything anymore I just feel lost as hell and feel like I am in a middle of a life crisis. I had a break up and a year ago and it really affected my self esteem. I start univercity next year but really does not want to go there this miserable because I know it will affect my studies. I was wondering if it is depression because I can count how many times I have been happy the past few months and I really hate how I feel most of the time I use day dreaming and weed now as a way to escape but every time reality hits harder. Thanks for listening to me ranting! Depression or just unhappiness?,Depression
8505,I have been feling depressed for a while now some days i do not have the energy or motivation to do anything but I am not sure if it is depression or I am just very sad . sorry if any mistakes I am romanian How do yau know if you have depression?,Depression
8738,So its only be 2 days but I hate my new school I miss my old friends and everything does not feel real at all I never asked to be bullied out of my old school especially when I was going to the wellbeing office on the campus but those fuckers did not care anyway I am stuck with the painfull and life at my new school I hate going here physically I wish to do school work at home in solitude which is how I feel comfortable with anything nowadays at least for the past 3 years now. I have no one to talk to other than my old friends and my pyschologist and my parents at times I feel trapped in this terrible period I hate it. I hate my new school,Depression
8375,I have dropped out of college but I am reapplying for a different major and I feel stuck. I do not know what to study or what career to pursue. My childhood dream was to be an actor but I can stick this idea right up my ass because its oversaturated anyway and who am I to make it.they definitely have better options bc who wants a depressed ugly fuck anyway.I have to move out very soon but I do not know where I should go. The idea of living in a shared apartment makes me sick but living alone would be too lonely. I do not see a future for menot now not ever.I am having multiple breakdowns a dayI am cryingyellingsuicide is constantly on my mind but I am always trying to calm myself down which only lasts for around 15 minutes and then it all starts all over again.i cannot live life normally at this point and I wish I was a different persondifferent circumstancesdifferent family.Life probably are not for me and its okay. Death cannot be worse than this. I have reached a new low,Depression
7861,look i do not want any sympathy or anything i just want to vent. i am a 21 year old male asian male born in the UK who is a current university student doing psychology with criminology which is great and all but that is probably the only thing going for me and even then i do not know what I am about to do with this degree. anyway since covid has hit I have been at home back with my parents since 2020 and been literally doing nothing. i do not help pay rent no part time job and a constant mess in my head. i am diagnosed with severe social anxiety and that has been getting in my way constantly. it is hard for me to make friends I am scared of job interviews so never go through with them. i only managed to open up with others when i am drunk other than that i only have 1 friend left that i can speak to quite comfortably. i fear rejection i am an attention seeker and constantly need approval from others and this really messes with me. thing is seeing others who have jobs people going out with friends having fun makes me jealous. idk what the because of this is I have always had an overprotective mum who does not allow me to do a lot of things and wants me to tell her everything that i do as if i need her permission. i was not like this when i was younger i was the chatty one causing trouble but ever since around 14 i changed. now that i think about it it might be the racial abuse i received during 1415 and that may have knocked my confidence but who knows. I am so useless,Depression
8041,Always being busy for the entire day has helped me shift my focus. I have taken up a lot of hobbies just so that I could fill my day that I do not have time to overthink. Yes I still have suicidal thoughts and do go back from time to time. But this method has helped me to reduce the severity of those situations. Another thing that has really helped me is learning to enjoy the nature like when it is raining or you are going for a walk in a sunny day. I do recommend learning to ride a bike because it has helped me a lot. My friends forced me to go outside and learn riding. It is not going to work wonders but the sense of control to be able to control the pace at which everything is moving on the open road really helps you calm down it just helps you be at peace. This is just something that worked for me,Depression
8188,we are still friends it is actually working out being like sisters but I want her to love me like she used to.My love is still the same hers is not. I want her to love me again I just want her back,Depression
7051,After this pandemic is over and i can finally go out i will overdose myself will sleeping pills. to be honest i do not want to die but I am just too tired to live. the last time i felt true happiness was in the 6th grade i mean my family is ok and they did not do anything wrong but for the past 6 years I have never been truly happy i decided after the pandemic is over I am going to kill myself,Depression
7704,In 2016 after living by myself I had to come back to my parents place. I was pretty miserable because my return was the result of several disappointments and failures in a row.The 2 following years were pretty dark I did not know what to do with myself and a childhood friend that was very dear to me kind of betrayed me and it totally broke my heart.In 2019 I finally found a job that was perfect for me. I knew the place my boss was very understanding regarding my shyness anxiety etc I was good at it I got my first salary and the first car etc Things were getting much better.I did not move out because I was working part time meaning I was not earning much and I chose to prioritise spending my little savings into a car rather than an apartment. Then my contract ended and I have been looking for a job since last January. I have been applying to jobs all over the country and oversea super confident but I barely get any feedback and when I do we proceed to have an interview but then I do not hear back from anyone.I was okay with living at home because my mom and brother were still there but she divorced him which I am happy about my dad has been sucking the joy out of us and belittling us our entire lives and my brother left too so now I am stuck with my dad I cannot even look in the eyes and broke. I was supposed to live with my mom but her new boyfriend moved in instead. That hurt too but I want to let her live her life with him she deserves it after years of submission to my dad.I know I could try to apply to a different job that is hiring more in the meantime but as I mentionned I am very discreet anxious shy but also clumsy distracted and I am pretty sure that I would be a burden and suck at anything that is not of my qualifications. I do not feel capable of doing anything I do not know alreadyIm very alone. I got a couple friends and I am thankful for them but my social life is far from being exciting and my love life is simply inexistant. I was relatively fine with it because frankly relationships scare me so I was kind of at peace with it but considering my current situation that lack of love is adding to my list of what is making me feel worthless. Someone that could make my heart feel a bit lighter would not harm right now.If you read it that far Sorry that was a lot of self pity. I needed to get that off my chest.I know I am most likely not dealing with things in the best way possible and could certainly do more please do not come at me too hard for it I am trying I feel trapped and defeated,Depression
7664, Anyone feeling a bit lost in their teens30s watch this,Depression
8127,I would prefer to keep my identity anonymous but I am at highschool and I was basically a pretty energetic individual until I got hit with the fact that my friends hate me because of a stupid asshole I ended up becoming the quiet nerd not really as I was not working enough at my school work even though I am confident I am an excellent student. 2 years later I ask them again now if we can go out or something and they told me they would see 3 out of 9 people supported me and were able to make that asshole agree to voting which ended up being that I am not a person they would ever invite and my friends did not stand up for me they just rules are rules so I just cut all contact they can have with me which I think does not really matter because they would not give a fuck I have been suffering from social anxiety for many years and now the only thing that I can think of is why am I hated and for how long and I cannot talk to anybody else and now I am just surrounded by no true person I am breaking down and might have suicidal thoughts any advice please? My friends hate me hanging out with them because of some stupid assholes who hang out with them and I cannot take it anymore,Depression
7172,So I just found out I got banned from Omegle. do not understand why but whatever. I am super depressed due to the deaths of most of my grandparents due to covid. Any chance I can get back in or am I just fucked? The real kick in the pants is I used to do crazy shit on Omegle when I was heavy into alcohol now I just use it to talk to people yet I still got banned now not back when I was putting guns in my mouth. I just feel alone and needed this as an outlet. Banned from entertainment.,Depression
7895,i do not feel anything anymore....i used to love and care about everything but got hurt so much that i used to wish that i could be like those girls who did not feel anything. Now my wish finally came true i regret making that wish... Now that i do not feel anything I am doing everything to feel something.Cutting smoking having sex. i cannot feel anything anymore.I am so numb i cannot cry anymore i do not feel any emotionsi just wake up work and drinki wish i could go back back to when i could at least feel something.. numb,Depression
8427,So i just moved out from my moms house and my home town after 22 yrs. And as much as i like it i am also anxious and stressed. Its probably because i have a puppy9 months which i brought with me it is mine afterall. But since its my first dog ever and my first time ever moving out i am very overwhelmed. I had depression long before i moved out or got a dog aswell. When i was home in my hometown i felt less stressed because of much less responsibility.. now i have work i have my dog rent to pay bills food expenses and gas for my car.. I have exams in 3 months which i need for my apprenticeshipwhere i work.. I am so stressed and overwhelmed and idk what to do. I feel like I am going to get very mentally ill if i keep feeling like this for a long time. Also i am living underneath the people i pay rent to they have a dog too and whenever he barks my dog will also bark.. i feel like I am failing to train my dog correctly aswell because of this. Depressed stressed anxious.,Depression
8923,So I have been feeling this way for well ages. After a few life changing moments a few years ago I suddenly actually want to stay. A few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. I absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. I am fighting my best fight but I have recently noticed I am slipping back into old habits. For example I have that nagging feeling that I am just not good enough unless I work myself to the bone even picking up a second job in the process and if I do not then I am worthless and not worthy of love. I have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. A lot to unpack there but I am kind of ignoring it for now. Today was an ok day but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. Small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. I closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then I began to list off in my head what I did and what I must have forgotten. I became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar I work at a tavern and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. It just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and I stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and I NEVER stay after for a drink because I feel so uncomfortable in social situations. I was close to tears as I hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. Am I taking his outburst as validation for how awful I already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? Me forgetting something at closing when I am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now I never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. I just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time I clock in which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. I want to never have to clock in again. I am terrified. Need help navigating uncertainty,Depression
8981,if we all came together in real life we could make a depressland state. how you would like depressland to look like? I feel wrong I just cannot believe there are 777000 of us depressed and there is nothing we can do about it together.,Depression
8884,I have had a decent summer nothing crazy like most kids but it was not bad. I did some stuff and went some places but a while back I went to this public place which had a lot of people.It made me Hella uncomfortable ngl and I did not realize this but the anxiety and fear is still there. A significant amount.I thought over summer break I had gotten over my fears and anxieties for the most part but I was wrong its still there and I am panicking because I am going to have to go back to campus and do stuff around thousands of people.there is going to be a lot of people and I am not ready for it feel like Ill throw up again.I am scared terrified actually. please kill me. tomorrow I have to go to school for registration and stuff like that and I am pretty nervous.,Depression
8157,I have anxietydepression and am on antidepressants and am generally in a good place. Every so often I get in these really low moods they last for a few days more or less and nothing seems to help. Is this normal? They usually go away but when I am in them I have no motivation I feel anxious I have a really low mood and I just feel like it will not end and I really want it to pass. I constantly google things and reasons why it might be happening because its so out of the blue! Does this happen to anyone else? Have any tips for getting through these ruts? Feeling down for a few days,Depression
8691,Why does this always happen I do not even know what i expect to happen why do i even bother to talk just fck all of this I hate when people i open up to start diagnosing me,Depression
7139,I am a 27m Pansexual and Autistic. Growing up I was bullied alot but I can recall having happy moments even happy moments with my mother but as I grew my mother and I started to become more argumentative and hostile and drastically effected my mental standing. Everyday was mental struggle to find happiness and I would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime and it helped me ignore it but then came the Dark Day an argument so drastic that I had to kick myself out to my wife's girlfriend then house. For awhile I felt great! My mother's hostility felt like the Moon from Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask and leaving finally made it disappear. Come Present day my anxiety had risen things are harder to enjoy and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where I cannot have a day with out hearing my mother's voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screwups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife who battles against depression and is possibly autistic. I feeling like I am losing the war for my mind and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again CONSTANTLY creep up. This has spiraled into beast that just will not die. I do not know what to do and I have come here as a start because idea how to ask for help and have actively avoided looking for help because I am too ashamed The Root of a Losing War,Depression
7058,First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30 soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I deserved to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space. Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni drifted from a lot of them due to smoking I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat. Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my selfloathing was unwarranted. When we broke up and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury I can walk again now thankfully it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of betrayal and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boringself indulgentan asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the here and now in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ageist. I have a sister we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.. I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden a waste of space a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself my partner could be free would not have to mind me and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself I cease to be a burden after the funeral has been planned and done. If I killed myself depending in the means I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable I constantly try to suppress it or hide it I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press off,Depression
8140,Hello I been really struggling with depression recently and I am currently not able to get professional help. I am in a good place physically. I got a job at Yellowstone National park and my job comes with room and board so I was able to move out of an abusive living situation and I have good plans for after my contract here is done. Things should be good but I feel horrible and I am not sure what to do I am really depressed and I do not know why,Depression
8692,I m sick and tired on how my life's goingi know it sound so cliche but that how I being truly feeling recentlyI feel like everyday my life's going downhill. it is been like a month since I have been feeling like this. I WAS not this type of a guy . I do not feel like working out which I used to love doing for like 45 times a week. I have been eating less and less everyday I got a lot of assignment and studying pending too but I just cannot do it. I only get motivation to work for max an hour or two only when the work is really important otherwise I spend most of my day laying in my bed I just do not like how everything is going recently I just want my motivation back so that I get back to my normal life back I want my motivation back,Depression
7148,I feel awful right now and almost every night. I cannot go to bed anymore without realizing how much no one loves me or how much I hate college! Its only worse that I have been thinking a little more about the idea of suicide. I swear I am considering it after graduation. One day I am feeling great the next day just okay. Right now I feel like absolute shit,Depression
8747,When I talk to my family about it I am obviously stressing them out. So I am turning to here. Also they say that I have two options suck it up or they will send me to the mental hospital. They think I can just snap out of it by thinking positive I try. But intrusive thoughts are INTRUSIVE. And I cannot solve the issue of my lows absolute sadness feel like I am being held down by bricks and highs anger and screaming rage when there is LITERALLY NO because. They do not understand what I mean they think its me choosing this. Its been months. If you guys listen to Hobo Johnson I am sure you have heard him say that hell get therapy when he can afford it. Well I am in that position a bitch cannot pay for therapy or afford a psychiatrist. Idk what to do. I am trying to better my life by saving money and doing my life goals but LIVING is not looking fun to me anymore. I have planned my suicide I think if it 50 times a day with intrusive thoughts. I am tired. I am losing sleep and I lost my appetite for days. Its not worth it.I know I have something but I cannot afford to find out what. Idk why I am posting this for help? Or to vent? what is wrong with me? I cannot afford to find out. Lol. Fuck it. Tw?,Depression
7090,I hate being alive. Every minute of everyday is just filled with pain and anguish. Why must we be forced to stay in a world that some of us do not see any hope or any type of future in? I am honestly at the end of my rope and there is nothing I can do to get myself out of this hole. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up because living is just a nightmare. there is no point,Depression
7568,This is my first post ever talking about my depression idk where to start. This past week I have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser I am in life. I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. My mom has spoiled me too much growing up and I took it for granted. It really hurts me to know I have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. I had a job back in early May where I working a Physical Therapy Aide position but did not even last a month there. I thought I was doing fine until I got a phone call to not come into work anymore. I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school I always had low selfesteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5year relationship w my high school love. My low selfesteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17 and you would think that would build complete confidence but the selfesteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos gym come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. She graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. She always gives me advice but I would brush it off bc I am too pussy to completely open up to her. I am going crazy. The day is almost over and what did i even do today? I am a little kid in a young adult's body 22year old in deep depression. Now starting to go crazy,Depression
7852,My family just begged me to go with them somewhere and spend some time together. I wanted to go so badly but felt paralyzed and could not even get myself to change into something else...... Anyone else felt this way? Like you want to do something or go somewhere but you just..cannot? I absolutely hate myself when this happens because I am disappointing them and being antisocial Feeling paralyzed,Depression
7103,I can tell my SO is getting fed up with my crying and mood swings. I feel like such a burden.Why am I even posting this? I do not know what to do,Depression
7292,The worst feeling is having all of these emotions bottled up and not being able to release them. I am drowning and it hurts so bad. I just want to cry,Depression
7311,I have been laying in bed all day. i do not have the energy to eat and i have not done anything but stare at my phone for the last 12 hours. i do not really care about myself a whole lot and i cannot muster up the energy to climb out of this depressive spiral right now. i do not feel like i have anyone in real life to talk to about this. any advice would be appreciated. m19 feeling emotionally numb do not know what to do.,Depression
8437,I just hate everything about me. My appearance my personality my stupid mental illnesses. Even if someone told me they loved me I would not believe them because how can someone love another that cannot even love themselves? Why am I so unlovable,Depression
8252,I have been talking to someone i had also met on here and i just told them i do not want to continue talking to them because it was beginning to affect me negatively. I feel like it was kind of selfish of me to do this because they have been going through a lot and i basically just left them. They seemed a little mad at me when i told them and now i do not know how to feel. When we would talk it felt like they were becoming dependent on me and it was just a lot of pressure but i truly did and still care about them. It just got too much. I do not know what to do. idk what i just did.,Depression
7132,Anyone else feel like their dog is the reason for living? Knowing something else in this world needs me and is always happy in my presence gives me reason to get up. Dog saved my life,Depression
7031,I have a good life if you were to look at me from the outside but I am rarely ever happy. I have noticed lately that when I am on social media and see something not ideal or bad happen to someone unplanned pregnancy breakups etc. I get a good feeling. Of course there are some instances where I am happy for family members and friends who have positive things happen to them but if its someone who has either ignored me especially if the opposite sex I get an especiallyyy good feeling when I see bad shit happen to them. I really want to work on this but it is not something that I have dealt with much beforeand it makes me feel like just a bad person at the end of the day. Any thoughts or similar experiences dealing with this? Thanks. Is this Normal?,Depression
8796,I feel like an actual child. I cannot control my emotions. I am full of RAGE and vengeance. I want to throw things and destroy everything in my path. FUCK IT ALL. I have been screamcrying for three days straight. I feel so raw. I am so fucking mad. I am done. I am DONE. I want everyone to DIE or FUCK OFF. I hope my father kills himself soon I REALLY do. He deserves pain. I want him gone. he is A WOMANIZING PIECE OF SHIT NARCISSIST WHO DESERVES TO DIE ALONE. YOU DROVE ME TO SUICIDE YOU BASTARD AND CALLED IT A STUNT. YOU GAVE ME DIAZEPAM. YOU LEFT PILLS OUT. YOU RUINED YOUR LITTLE GIRL. FUCKING DO EVERYONE A FAVOR AND HANG YOURSELF. ITS ALL YOU ARE GOOD AT. FUCK THIS WORLD! I do not even want to die I am just in agonizing grieving pain these past days,Depression
8367,Hopefully I do not wake up tomorrow Yup I want to end it all,Depression
7791,Hi allLet me introduce myself. I am a 22y old male student. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder back in 2016 and since then I have been on meds antipsychotics antidepressants and mood stabilizators .Lately I have been without will to study and I have been feeling really lazy and with some intrusive thoughts that are common for OCD. As of today I have been smoking a pack or more of cigarettes a day. All of what I do during the day comes down to eating and smoking and sleeping. I do not feel happy with my life. I may lose my scholarship for university and I only did one exam in two months. I am worried is this may be a sign of depression?Thanks to all who read and reply! Is this depression?,Depression
7794,I am just tired of everything and want to stop existing. This shit sucks and I would rather not be here. Who in their right mind thought living life like this was bearable?Not one person gives a shit. I am not even sure I even care anymore. So like I said fuck everything. Honestly fuck everything,Depression

7100,Both excited and discouraged to go back to therapy. My episodes of being super depressed and constant worrying has gotten super bad again. Sometimes I feel like I am wasting the therapists time for going as I keep having the same problems I always have but hopefully this time will help more? Wish me luck Reddit. Just scheduled a therapy session for the first time in months,Depression
8357,I am literally a she will of how I used to look. And I am only 22. Deep down hoping I can turn this around but it is looking bleak I do not think we talk enough about how much depression ruins your looks...,Depression
8838,i have goals and ideas that I have been wanting to pursue since forever but i still just cannot get myself to do anything. whenever i have free time i opt for the most comforting activity rather than something productive. and my biggest problem is that when i finally buckle down to do something productive i stop when things begin to get hard. I am just so lazy. i know depression plays a big role in why I am like this but idk. i want to better myself so so unmotivated to do anything,Depression
8239,I believe that I am just a fat useless worthless autistic loser. My whole life was a disaster from childhood up to now. I was bullied my whole life eventually online for 3 years as well. I was not the best kid either because I was immature and had a temper which I still do. In college nobody liked me because I was different due to my autism. Same with 2 High School bands and every job I had. So basically I was hated my entire life. there is no point in me having a career in anything either because nobody will ever hire me so there is no point in trying. I truly believe that I deserve to die what is the point?,Depression
7210,hah i have my own little imaginary world where everything is so perfect and it helps me sleep at night and its so much better i doubt it will ever become reality it could if i was skinny but it will not because i do not try my anxiety is off the rails but staying cheerful is what gets me through the day even if people take advantagei really wish i was the girl in my imaginary head everyone loves her and she is a perfect girl truly is amazing she is the opposite of me hahawhy cannot i be her my little imaginary life,Depression
8471,I cannot get relationships down. It always seems to end the same way. I give and give and do everything right in the relationship. Then it turns out the guy is cheating and using me. I know I am not some supermodel looking woman I still think I am pretty. Well I did not anymore. I tried working around the cheating by offering open relationships. They always turn that down though. So what is wrong with me that I am not good enough? Just feeling really low after another one cheated. 1 year relationship down the drain. At this rate I will never marry or have a family of my own. I feel like such a failure and fool,Depression
8617,The past few weeks I have been feeling really bad just for no reason and recently I developed an extreme hatred for myself. Like inside of me splits into half and half of me take myself as my own enemy. I talked to my GP my counsellor and the Samaritans I take the tablets and tried suggestions they gave me but it all did not work really well. Like those things only help me at that moment but in the end it all comes back to where it was and started draining me out. I try to keep myself calm during the day but at night while everyone is asleep that is when I get extremely mad at myself like I am losing my mind. I have to bitecut myself so the pain calms me down but I know this is not right and cannot be a longterm solution. Please if someone has gone through something similar let me know how you have overcome this? Thank you so much. Can someone give me advice please..?,Depression
7787,Hi am 24 and I have been trying to figure out my career. I am a very creative person atleast I think that since I make electronic music play tabla Indian instrument and sing. Along with that I am a very emotional personal and care about small things a lot. I think I feel things very intensely even if its a small feeling of love anger hat etc. My problem is I have started losing interest in things. Some days back I was really excited to make music which I did but lost interest in 2 days. Then I was interested in making a product that is environmental friendly and lost interest in a few days. I just lose interest in everything. I need suggestions on how I can be more patient and figure out things for myself. I do not want to be that human who would go for a shit ass job and work there 95. I want to be in a more creative pursuit in life and I would really appreaciate your suggestions.Thanks if you read it till the end I lose interest in everything in some time,Depression
7744,I think it is time to end my life. I only have a postsecondary school no job. They will not accept me anywhere. They are not responding to my job applications. I have been looking for a job for three years. With no effect. there is no way I can find anything. I do not have any future. I do not have any future,Depression
7507,I have had depression since I was 1314 and now I am 25. I have been pushing myself through it every year. Through school mental breakdowns work trying to do everything I am supposed to do. I have felt this collapse coming since the past year I felt like I am going to break soon. And here it is. Fuck. I feel everything and nothing at the same time. I do not process it. When my boyfriend raises his voice because he cannot stand how I always have a bad attitude then I feel scared then maybe Ill she would a tear and then Ill forget about it. I feel nothing. I want to die and end everything at this point. Everything does not feel like its right or working out. Promotions or jobs I cannot feel motivated for it anymore. I actually am probably getting a new better job but I do not think I can even handle it. I feel I pushed myself to the fucking extreme all these years trying to be ok and do my job that all the repressed things are coming back to me. I feel like I need to change things right now. I just want to be completely alone but also not alone at the same time. I have been avoiding taking meds the last few years fear of creating dependency. But I booked an appointment to get some because I think if I do not try or anything I might actually kill myself. My mood shifts are so fucking extreme. One day I could be looking at all things for the future planning financials jobs homes. The next day I am in bed and time does not seem to exist i just lay there in existential dread of being alive. High functioning depression to crippling depression,Depression
7093,Lockdown has been extended for another four weeks until the end of August for me. It sucks I miss socialising and trying to enjoy the few things that bring me joy in life. Unfortunately it has to be done and hopefully will not be much longer. Until then I am downdepressed laying in bed all day with nothing to do and just being miserable. Lockdown depression.,Depression
8323,I just do not feel like doing anything anymore let it be playing with my animals three dogs and two cats going outside assisting my dad with work hanging out with friends or anything really.I am already a mess. I stay up all night just laying in bed. I stopped doing the things I love and just stopped caring about everything.People always say the same thing. Get a therapist or it will be better soon. I know they are lying though. I have been like this for about five years now. Heh my dad always says that he gets it. However he does not. He does not feel like he is constantly drowning in sorrow.I cannot get a therapist because then I will have to use my parent's money and then they will find out how I am and I do not want that. I do not want their pity.ampx200BSorry for the rant and waste of time for those who read this. I feel so useless,Depression
7075,I hate my thoughts because they are intrusive depressing loud and give me headaches so I listen to music to drown them out up until recently I was told this was not normal. So my question is what does it mean? Do I have a mental thing or am I just depressed? What does it mean when I have to listen to music to ignore my thoughts?,Depression
8227,Just when I think I am starting to get better and get a hold of my anxiety amp depression something triggers me and I am back to feeling an immense amount of pain and suicidal thoughts. Its so scary when you are brain is constantly telling you that you are better off dead. I do not really want to die I want to be somewhat at peace with myself and just live a decent life. It feels like that is just not going to happen for me. Sometimes I truly think that I was destined to commit suicide. I am hanging on by a thread at this point and as time goes on the hope I have left gets smaller and smaller. I cannot make any friends due to social anxiety and now spend almost all my days alone. I think I have a decent personality but no one ever gets to see it because of my sa. I feel like everyone just hates me. what is the point of life if you cannot even make meaningful relationships with people? I do not want to die but I do not want to be alive either. So tired of trying to get better and constantly being knocked down. My depression has me in a chokehold rn and I am trying so hard to not end it. I deserve to be happy and live a good life. I am not giving up on myself yet Just when I think I am getting better,Depression
8431,I have no energy and no desire to do anything with my life at the moment. It feels like there is this incredible weight inside of me. The lethargy is INCREDIBLY intense. This has gone on for about a month now. I no longer find enjoyment in anything. I have absolutely no appetite and eating is a total chore. The two things that sadly consumed much of my life porn and video games no longer give me any satisfaction. I feel like I just want my body and soul to dissolve into a setting sun on a beautiful exotic beach.I am in college getting an undergraduate degree in computer science. I enjoy studying CS and computer programming but I just have no desire to do it now.I worry a lot about finding a job when I graduate next year. I hate working for people but I have no choice. I feel like such a wage slave doing these meaningless jobs that realistically do not matter to anybody or make anyone's life better except for some ultra wealthy corporate owners who really could not give a flying fck about you or anyone working along side you. Then there is the fact that the world has gone completely fcking mad and quite literally insane since 2020 rolled around. If you DARE to disagree with anyone nowadays you are considered a threat to humanity and must be purged from the Earth. People are so far divided over everything it makes me fcking sick. People are cutting off friendships family members are refusing to talk to one another because of various political issues.Oh and one other thing I am living with my parents now and I hate my father. he is an incredibly depressing disgusting pathetic individual. I thought about whether I would feel sad if he suddenly died tomorrow and honestly I could not find an answer. Someone I met awhile ago gave me some sage advice about people like him miserable people enjoy making other people miserable. I cannot stress enough how true this is! I cannot wait to get the fck away from this guy when I leave to go back to school in the fall. I need help. I am not sure what to do other than come here and complain. I want to try meditation maybe that will do something.Any suggestions? I am like dying here. I Just Want To Dissolve Into Infinity,Depression
7052,I feel like a burden to everyone including myself in my life one that no one wants to help. Feeling like a burden,Depression
7966,I have been completely alone for about 3 years now. I live alone work a decent paying job and that is about it. I struggle to clean or do laundry or shower unless it has to do with work. I am responsible as far as work is concerned but cannot accomplish anything else at all in my life. I have thousands of dollars saved I live in a good area in a large house but every minute of every day is a struggle. I am really having to struggle to function each day. I think about ending it all often if barely not daily. Every friend has left. All the family is gone. Its just me and my cat and the main reason I do not end it is because I do not want him to eat me when no one notices I am gone. I need help. I have been alone so long,Depression
8263,This is my first time posting here or anywhere actually but I just really wanted to share this with someone. I have lost all my interest in things I used to enjoy the most. I think it happened three or four years ago but I could not accept the fact that I do not enjoy the thing I used to love the most it was animated movies so I kept forcing myself to watch them but every time I kept having weird thoughts and just would give up watching them thinking that Ill start enjoying later. To be honest the fact that I lost all my interest made me even more depressed. Now I do not enjoy anything. Listening to music does not bring joy anymore I skip meals and I do not feel excited for food as I used to before. I used to like cooking but now frying an egg seems like an impossible task to do. I started getting panic attacks last fall and struggled with thanatophobia for couple years and now I just have no energy to do anything. I feel anxious all the time. Sometimes I try watching some tv show but for some reason I just cannot watch it even if I want to. I cannot sleep at nights and only fall asleep when its 79am. I feel bad for my family because I feel like I am a waste of space and just useless but at the same time I cannot bring myself to do anything. I wish I never existed I feel like a total disappointment. Before I wanted to get therapy but after going to four different therapists I lost all the hope and now I do not want to cure my depression. For some reason my depression makes me feel safe now. I am really confused on what is happening with me. I am sorry for such a long post Losing interest,Depression
8613,Hi everyoneI am at a point now where my mindbody are completely shut off when I am at work. I have been with this company for almost a year and it is no secret that I am incompetent and disengaged. I do not think this has anything to do with the company itself or the work or the people but the deteriorated state of my mental health due to years of major depression. Believe me I have tried many ways of coping but it never gets better I always resort to selfharm and suicidal behavior. I am so exhausted now that I cannot muster up any more strength to force my brain to focus on the tasks at hand. I want to quit so bad but I do not want to leave in an unprofessional manner. Does anyone struggle with their mental health at work as well? What did you decide to do about it? Selfharming at work,Depression
8955,Thinking about how overly sexualized my gender is has begun to drive me insane. I am so upset all the time. Everywhere I look women are being exploited and displayed as objects. Ads movies songs books LITERALLY fucking everything involving a woman is basing her worth on her looks and fuckability. Its making me so depressed and anxious and I am finding it hard to trust the men in my life. I know not all men see women as sex objects but the subconscious conditioning is real. Every man I have ever been friends with had initially wanted a sexual or romantic relationship with me. I feel hopeless and disgusted and just ready to stop existing in such a gross world. I cannot seem to stop thinking about this. Please help me. Over sexualization of women,Depression
7764,I am so scared of everything when will it stop? scared,Depression
7241,Its been around a month since I have had a depressive episode and its back again. The crying every night the thinking about my past causing me to lack sleep getting you look tired looks from family and friends who see me people checking in on me because they know something is wrong even though I try so hard to minimize it and keep it under wraps. I just have no clue what to do anymore. My parents would be depressed if I were gone and my alcoholic sister would never even be able to fully understand it who knows if she would even find out. After a while though everyone would heal and life would continue on. Maybe one or two people would visit my grave but after then the trips would become farther and farther away until I am just another headstone. Who knows would I even get a grave? that is expensive and I would not want my parents to have to pay for that. is not that crazy? We die and then we have to pay for dying. Fucked up. And even if I stay alive. Will anyone ever love me? When I was little I dreamed of being a single mom because I thought that it was more realistic than marriage. My cousin and I used to talk about getting beaten and how bad it was but we never told anyone because we thought it was normal. Now were both 20 and depressed. that is life I guess. Its coming back again,Depression
7908,I have been living alone for about 8 years now. My main source of socializing came from going into the office but that is pretty dead now and most people want to work from home. Also the work is shit now so I am trying desperately to change jobs.there is a lot of different issues happening all at the same time and giving me massive stress. Throughout all of this I am trying to combat PTSD and doing everything in my power to not self harm or jump straight to suicide. I kill the thoughts immediately.ButI'm slipping. I have to give a little bit in some areas to compensate for others. And I keep having to do it so now the thoughts become longer and more enticing and grip me.I am so fucked right now I cannot even self mock and laugh about it. I have been trying to cry and it does not work. Quick one,Depression
8048,trigger warningI have never been so angry when hurting myself before. but with ever cut i made I thought of each reason I was doing it. you are ugly. You deserve nothing. You will never amount to anything. You are a failure you are fat. It burns where I cut and I do not feel like doing more but I want to because I feel like it is what I deserve i relapsed into cutting again today,Depression
7799,If there is one thing I am certain it is the fact that I am feeling like I am straying further away from social interaction. I have been a complete shutin since my senior year in high school and now I am already a fulltime grinder. I used to force myself to go out and do things alone like go to a movie shopping cafe... yet for the past couple years I stopped doing so. Basically my routine is just wake up go to work now from home come back home to sleep. The rest I just spend on computer playing games or watching anime. I do have couple of friends that are still connected but that is all there is in my circle. I feel like I am just existing for the sakes of the existence itself and not living because to 'live' you need a purpose and I have got none. I exist but not living,Depression
6991,Hello guys i m 21 with high eye pressure and currently on lumigan .

8108,I am always ashamed of posting here because I think it is annoying to other people even though I know there is thousand of members and no one will remember me. I am writting this as I am in my room and it' horryfing to notice the poor hygiene of the roomthe clothes piled up in the floor growing bigger. Every day is exactly the same and every day fucking sucks. I literally have no motivation to live to get up because I know exactly how it is going to end. Today I tried to make it different I took a shower I dolled up went to visit my grandma. Not even an hour passed before I was ready to tear my eyes out. I hate being alive so much. I am young and I hate it so much to think I still have to live this shitty life God knows how many more years. it is getting bad again and I am so helpless. I lash out because my anxiety and my depression is not always crying. it is rage.Again I do not know what to do.I cannot even pin point why It got bad again. I am out control. Getting back again,Depression
8855,I do not image living past my 30s although I have goals in life I do not imagine them coming through I am too scared to kill myself but so tired of living I got myself a therapist but she barely keep in contact with me when she does all she does is a depression screening I am only 15 and do not know how to handle what I am feeling I do not know how to feel,Depression
7121,I have horrible sleep problems so the times that I am up there is no one to talk to all I can do is watch videos all night. Its always at night that I feel miserable hopeless and alone. Nights are the worst,Depression
7285,Posting here mostly as a last resort since I feel like I bother others when I talk about my depression. I am a 23 years old girl and feel like a loser. I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember which was made worse when I was a teenager due to drug useexcessive drinking being sexually assaulted and briefly working as a sex worker although in a pretty sketchy way. I feel like no one cares. I feel like my friends do not really give a shit about me or would not care if I was not around. I feel like my band sucks even though I put so much of myself into it. I feel like people think I am stupid. I fear I may actually just be stupid. I feel unremarkable worthless. I have not attempted suicide in many years but sometimes I feel I am getting there again. I feel unhappy in my relationships and I think the problem is and always will be me. I try DBT and am on antidepressants. Any advice is appreciated. 23 yo really depressed and feel lost.,Depression
7606,I am tired of feeling tired of being depressed.My life is a bucket full of shit in which I stick my head into every morning.Most people are shallow and act only for their self interest but cover that under a veneer of false benevolence and think we cannot see through their bs. We live in a sick world where we only think about ourselves use nice people ditch them then repeat the process. The idea of suicide seems more and more attractive to me as days go by Life is made of pain,Depression
7991,I have been with my partner for nearly 3 yrs now and we have never once had sex hes been really patient with me. While we have never had vaginal intercourse we have done other things and I sometimes struggle with depression bringing down my libido. But for weeks now I have been struggling having any sort of intimacy with him. Last time I broke down crying as we made out with his body over me he did not notice as the lights were out. And he began to move his hands and the combination of anxiety and fear of him feeling my cuts started self harming recently made me run I left immediately and told him I could not do it. Prior to that I have had tears run down before but this time it was more and I felt as if I was suffocating. I love him and I am attracted to him but when this happens it feels like I am not there almost like I am just watching myself but I have no control over my body. I know I can tell him to stop at any moment but it feels as if I am mute and cannot bring myself to do so. He does not even know I struggle with depression no one does he just thinks I am saving myself or waiting for the right time. We were relatively young when we started dating as well so it makes sense that we have not had any relations during the 3 yrs. its scary when I disassociate I know hes someone I trust and love but it feels like rape in a way. I am not comparing the two but I do feel powerless and its not even his fault. I cannot be intimate,Depression
8929,that is all I have decided that fighting day in and day out to be anything other than a total disappointment to myself is just not worth it. I am 39 years old I have a stable job a wife and a kid. It seems like I should be happy. But I am not all I have are regrets and loneliness. I had to give up everything that made meme to have this wife. And then I had to give up my chance to rediscover myself when I had a kid. I love my daughter with all my shriveled heart can. But I hate every single aspect of my life. I work too much because I have no choice. I have no time for me because my wife says I have responsibilities to always be available when she needs me. I gave up my friends my hobbies and all the things that made me smile because I did not want to loose her. Now she is all I have and i am miserable. I hate my job and spend all day every day thinking god I just want this day to end. Then when I do have a day off she finds a way to make the entire day more work. And I spend my weekends just wishing they were over too. I have only the drive to not ruin my daughters life to keep me from driving my work truck off a bridge. I hope everyday that Ill fleet into a wreck or fall off a ladder just to finally be able to rest. Every spare thought I have is about all of the missed connections I have had and the insane shit I used to do . I look forward to nothing. I cannot find a single thing about my life that I do not hate except my kid. I just decided tonight that I am going to give up on having any semblance of my self. I am pointless. I have decided to give up,Depression
8896,f18. I do not know how long this is been going on for because I do not reminder but its getting hard to do things again.My parents left the house for me for three or so weeks and I took care of the house for a really long time and now its just not getting picked up again its not nasty moldy bugs or anything but it should be cleaner than this. Its mainly just dishes not being put up from the dishwasher the laundry is not done the beds are not made up etc.I used to be taking showers every day right now its almost every other day again or just days with my boyfriend and I hang out or he comes over here. I ran a full tub of water for a bath and I almost got in but at the last minute I decided to put clothes back on and just go in bed and drain the tub out and we have a huge tub because its in the master bedroom and it was a waste of water and it makes me feel bad.I have not really gone out and done anything recently. I went shopping a while ago with my boyfriend and then within these past few days we went to the gym one time but I only walked on the treadmill for about less than a mile and I did some weights it was a lot less than I used to do. Then later that night he picked me up again and we got gas in town and I did not even get to get dressed I just left with what I had on which ones just a shirt Nike shorts and slip on shoes not even a bra even though I always put them on.I have not really been eating when I normally should I would eat a long time after I woke up and then not again until around midnight. I have been sleeping a lot mostly in an accident and its to the point where my boyfriend has been saying are you sure you are not having narcolepsy but I know I do not its just tiredness.My boyfriend and I have plans to go out next Friday and I am having a hard time getting motivated for that even though it will seem like a fun time and we also have to move in together at the same day same time and were planning to stay the night and burn around the city for two days to get used to it and I am having a hard time getting motivated for her to even though it sounds like fun with him.I am going to college in less than a month and I already made a post about how I feel like I do not fit in and the comments are really kind and considerate really make me feel any different besides a tad bit I am glad other people feel the same as me somewhat. I cannot even explain why I do not fit in. Its beginning to be hard to find motivation again,Depression
7971,I have struggled with depression for many years now. My goto strategy to get help was to reach out to my friends and talk about it. But I use that too much it became that I was ranting to them every day sometimes multiple times a day and that pushed away almost all of my friends. So I am working on not reaching out as much. But I think that support from my friends would be really helpful I still want some kind of support. What are some ideas for how my friends can helpsupport me so that I feel supported but that it does not hurt them in the process? How can friends support me?,Depression
8076,I mean I could have everything in the world but I still feel like I would be fking depressed. I just cannot sometimes the world is a shitty and dark place and I have been through some traumatic shit. I feel suicidal lowkey passively every day just every day i wonder why am I still here? I do not want to fail at trying so I just keep my head up and just go through the motions of life but it is exhausting. I feel like I cannot do what normal people do have a 8 to 5 job and social life and be happy.Happiness is difficult for me. What is the point of life?,Depression
8541,I have tried to change life around a bit. I could be the richest guy on the planet but I would still be couped up in my head all the time being scared of the world. I fucking hate my life and I will always have suicide as my friend if I need them. there is just no changing anything,Depression
7343,My retail job is making me depressed. I dread going there everyday. I feel like I am at the end of my rope with it. The days I do not work I cannot do things I enjoy because I am so tired from work. I do not even really have that many things I enjoy anyway. Is this all life is? Just working and being tired and working again until we die? If life is just working and being tired from working what is the point?,Depression
8936,I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes and other errors i will probably make.Well the post title is just that living is fun and all sometimes but i just cannot handle it anymore. No matter what i try i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father the occasional kick or punch i can deal with but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it eating it or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah she was a friend of my GF and me at the time and when shit hit the fan she was there for me i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a jobIt would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself That still sticks with me today i think about it every single time i get closer to someone every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore every single day seems to get worse and worse.

7422,Breaking is what I call what I think is an anxiety attack. I start getting anxious for almost no reason. I get scared really really scared. I start to feel hopeless. The thoughts will not go away. I cannot be happy. And it starts around this time of the day and does not end until I go asleep. Some days it does not happen but other days like today. It does. Any tips on stopping it before it really takes over? I have the types of thoughts it brings throughout the day but they usually go away. I am able to focus on other things. But at times like these they start to overwhelm and crush me. I am about to break again is there any way to stop it?,Depression
7158,Is life even worth living like this? I am 21 years old and no one likes me,Depression
8224,I feel like sometimes it would be easier to just end it. And not have to worry about anything. Sad,Depression
7652,Is anyone having a particularly bad time right now? I really need to get outside my head and maybe gain some perspective through the problems of others. Last summer I lost my job. I have been working towards improving my symptoms and I do see a steady improvement. A few months ago I could not sleep for more than 3 hours. Falling asleep was almost impossible. My anxiety shot through the roof as I was having daily panic attacks a new thing for me. I lost my job went back to school and got my degree. I am worried all the time. I ruminate all the time. I was bedridden for a few months and I lost about 50 pounds. My muscles have atrophied. My teeth rotted as I was not caring for myself. I am in a lot of pain physically and mentally. I cry multiple times a day sometimes uncontrollably. I will be 30 in less than a year and I feel like I am already dying. All I can think of is the negative even though I have some positives. I am relatively healthy no serious physical diseases.I have an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. I love her more than anything and she always returns the love tenfold. She has been trying to support me during this very dark period and I feel horrible for dragging her down. When the depression and anxiety were at their peak I was considering suicide every minute of the day. I had to call the suicide hotline and the lady I talked with used a tough love approach which actually helped put things in perspective. Anyway even though the symptoms have been improving things keep happening in the middle of my recovery that trigger the anxiety and depression. Just yesterday when I was feeling quite good about my situation I became the victim of identity theft. Here we go again. One step forward and 10 steps back. I obsess about things and it has been driving me crazy. There are compounding problems contributing to this hole I have dug besides my mental health. I need a kind stranger to tell me what they are going through as well so I do not feel so alone. I am hurting really bad. My heart and spirit feel broken. Anyone else? Anyone Else Having The Worst Year of Their Lives? I desperately want to feel less alone and reading about the what others are going through helps.,Depression
7059,I do not care if anyone reads this or upvotes. I just need to ask why I cannot just be happy? Why cannot I be normal and enjoy things anymore? Why does it have to suck? Why does not anything make it better? Why cannot I be happy for what I know are good things around me and in my life? Why did not I bring my gun today to end this? Why? Sorry. Why?,Depression
9149,22F I was turned off from sex after a very disappointing dateencounter where I know I did not want to have sex and did not like the person. I wanted company so I made the mistake of going back to his place for tea. We did other things and I drew the line on intercourse. He did not get the message or did not care and kept trying to get me to give in. I did I was tired and feeling pretty unworthyunlovable. I did not want to be alone missed feeling wanted and felt generally if not him now then who later. I beat myself up over this for too long and worked through the shame of it all.My sex drive is pretty high so during this time it is kind of added to my depression but I think it is good that I took a time out. Now I am genuinely in a headspace where I want to only worry about myself and be selfish with my desires.How bad for my mental health would it be for me to look for someone to strictly just have sex with and not do the whole this is who I am who are you and do we match thing? I have always done it and it is basically only ever exhausted me.I know my worth yaddayadaya I am horny and sad is this going to be detrimental overall undo healing? Is there a healthy way to do this for me? I have been sexless for a year,Depression
8232,Hey guys for a long time now I have been feeling really bad about myself after a lot of negativity I have 0 self confidence and its always such an effort having a decent conversation with someone I always worry about if I am too awkward or stupid and just end up a mess in the process. When it comes to relationships none have ever worked out they were always pretty awkward and never lasted long I blame myself for it to be honest. Even after 10 months of gym and people telling me I look great I never feel good enough and I doubt I ever will. All in all I just feel terrible about myself. I have school in less than a month and I am turning 14 pretty soon its sad that life goes so fast I miss being happy and not caring about every tiny thing I do. I have not really talked about this kind of stuff ever so that is why I am saying it here. Hopefully someone understands me I am going to go sleep soon since its pretty late goodnight God bless. Low self esteem sucks ,Depression
7434,I have been fairly happy recently a lot happier than I have been in a really long time. I do think my depression is greatly improving. But I still wish I could take a break from being me for a day. Like take a vacation from being trapped in my own body. Its just exhausting and I think I would like myself a lot more if I was not always around me. Does anyone else relate? I wish I could take a break from being myself for a day,Depression
7407,When I get told I am a good guy it sometimes drives me near to tears. I have been told how nice I am. How funny I am. How dependable. I have been told many times by different people these things so it must be true right? But I guess I am not good enough. If I was it would not be so hard to find and keep people in my life. I know it sounds self serving and all pity party but its how I feel and the thoughts in my head. I realize and understand that I am not a priority to anyone else. I just wish I knew there was someone out there who thought of me sometimes. A complement upsets me,Depression

8784,I have been depressed for 34 years and my lack of access to my emotions decrease in memory and mental clarity has progressively gotten worse over time.I have tried things like fixing up my diet and exercising more to no avail. Will I have to get on antidepressants to fix these issues? Will I need to get on antidepressants to get my emotions back?,Depression
7689,I have been walking around being productive I have a boyfriend I have emancipation papers not filled out I have this big plan on how I am going to go out and live life and pursue college. I have told all my friends that I am going to leave my family which I feel like is emotionally and mentally abusive but I am not sure and go get an apartment and finish highschool and go straight to college and then Med school. Problem is I have not actually done any of that. This past year I got pulled out of school twice for suicide watch my grades plummeted I quit my sports team and I cut off most of my friends I stopped showing up to work and I just tried to not to kill myself. Recently its been getting worse at home. My father has become more controlling grounding me for stupid things taking away my car not letting me see my boyfriend or friends gaslighting me for not spending time with him etc. My mother has gotten better she has not manipulated me in a while so I think were fine. Her husband on the other hand says that I am the reason my mothers health has deteriorated both of my stepparents have said that I am the reason our family is dysfunctional. Sometimes I like to think I am stronger than others that I have it worse than my friends but that is not true at all. I am weaker than all of them. My life is so easy. So why should I want to stop existing? there is been awful shit that is happened when I was a kid Ill admit but as of late lifes not as bad as it could be. Idk I just feel so stupid. Living the vida depressy,Depression
8967,My life is fine I am pretty lucky actually but I can stop feeling utterly miserable bored and alone. there is nothing to do and I cannot bring myself to do anything. Anytime I start something I always want to stop after a couple of weeks. This has been going on for as long as I can remember. I wish I could just maintain an interest in something. I feel left out and unable to connect with others too. I just feel so trapped. I am just so unhappy. I have tried so hard to change it but I always have this cloud hanging over me. Surprise surprise another post about being miserable,Depression
8515,Sorry if any mistakes I am romanian I have a problem I am depressed and I am homeschooled I am a little behaind whit my school work I want to catch up this summer but i cannot find any energy or motivation to study any advice?,Depression
8761,Any form of intimacy gives me severe nausea. To describe it in detail you know that feeling you get when you are about to throw up? Your saliva is basically the consistency of water and you feel something being thrown up your esophagus? that happens but i never throw up. i get on the verge of vomiting but it never comes. this would in turn lead to a racing thoughts shortness of breath and every other symptom of anxiety you can think of. This happened to some degree almost every single time. did not matter what the form of intimacy was talking cuddling kissing or having sex but the more sexual the situation the worse the anxiety nausea was.I have only ever had one partner and we were together for about 4 months but i had to break up with her because the anxiety got so severe that my feelings were lost for her because i was overwhelmed with how intense the nausea and anxiety was. it got to the point where even just hanging out with her and have nothing go on between us made me sick to my stomach and sometimes she could not even touch me or i could not even look at her. she was not abusive or manipulative by any means in fact she was the most supportive person i could have asked for. when things were getting steamy she would ask if i was okay and if i needed a minute when the nausea happened i would step out of the roomcar and walk around taking deep breaths and she completely understood. she showered me with acceptance and understanding and i still could not get over the nausea and anxiety. We were completely open and transparent with eachother and it still happened. The level of nausea varied each time though. sometimes it was a little other times it was so intense i could not move. only a few times did i not have nausea at all. Now after breaking up with her a few months ago i have had multiple opportunities to even just hang out with a woman platonically 1 on 1 and i completely avoid it because it freaks me the fuck out. i do not want to have any form of intimacy anymore because i know how anxious and nauseous i will get. It just sucks because I am comfortable with like sending nudes and stuff and that is about it. i feel like such an asshole for even doing that because i know i will not be able to go any further than that. I get this problem with other things too like eating and going on vacation as well as being deathly scared of smoking and drinking but this particular situation is where it gets the most intense and the most frequent. I am on Prozac for my anxiety if that is any additional information that may help. this whole thing has spiraled me into a deep pit of self consciousness and even self hatred. I have had countless nights just lying awake thinking about what is wrong with me and why i cannot justenjoy life the way i want without having to be controlled by the way my stomach decides to act one day. I do not need a solution as soon as possible i just need a place to start in order to fix me. 20M I suffer from anxiety related nausea due to mainly intimacy with another person and it has left my mental health in absolute shambles.,Depression
8661,Practically every day I see posts on social media from those looking for their answers to this and very similar questions many from the context of having done a great deal of reflection through the Covid crisis and now as we hopefully begin to emerge in to a new and changed reality. Wellbeing psychology and the solution focused approach have a huge amount to offer in this respect and I am currently considering the feasibility of PERMA Hypnotherapy offering a program to meet this end combining the best from these areas to give a structured approach and an outcome that is a clear understanding of this is what I am this is what my life is about here is what I am going to do and why and this is my legacy to the world. It would be interesting to hear if there is a demand for such a program and if so what specifically would you like to see? what is the point?,Depression
8816,I disagree. I was not prepared for this shit at all. I am only 25 amp I feel like I have gone through hell and I am still going through hell. Every single day I sit here and feel like no matter what I do or how hard I try my situation does not improve. Rent is so high and jobs pay so little I cannot afford to move right now. I battle with my brain from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. Everyone in my family is talking about me behind my back and not doing anything to help me. I have asked for advice and help several times from them and my friends. They all ignore me and my friends abandoned me because I am not important to them. I feel like I am in this all alone. I have a very loving and caring boyfriend but I feel like I overwhelm him with my issues so I do not like to involve him at all. He always says hes here for me and I know he is. But my anxiety says different My problems are bigger than me and I cannot do shit about it. No one said it would be like this. Your 20s are the best years of your life!,Depression
8167,My wife is suffering from burnout and I think depression she has went to her mums as she wants a complete break for a few weeks we have 2 small dogs and they are my wife's world and she is not really bothered about seeing them or me because her empathy has been zapped. I love her so much and want to help I am keeping my space but I am in the dark and so confused the last week has been unbearable I want this feeling to go away! My wife wants a break as she is suffering from burnoutdepression,Depression
9033,So one of my coping mechanisms is spending lots of money on stuff I do not need I have been feeling a lot worse lately and around a week ago I had over a grand in my bank account now i have 89 if anyone has any advice or anything it would help a lot. I cannot stop spending money,Depression
7751,As a product of modern dystopian society I have become extremely socially awkward and unable to communicate with other human beings which has let me to fall into alchoholism and further financial unstability and depression and made me wonder about the meaning of my existence. So no mom. I did not get a girlfriend and quite honestly I am doubting I ever will My mom asked me if i have a girlfriend,Depression
7747,I think I hide my depression too well to the point where my own therapist thinks I am not. I never talk about how I really feel because I just do not have the guts to tell anyone in depth. Posting here is kind of my last resort I am not really sure what to do. Or I know what to do I just do not know how to get myself to do it. I hide my depression too well and my therapist thinks I am okay,Depression
8462,Hey so I have been having trouble crying recently because I have been holding in my tears for far to long so could somebody just write anything in the chat thingy to try and help me cry. You do not have to but it would be nice.,Depression
7345,I lie here after nearly two weeks of missing antidepressants because I ran out. Yesterday evening I took one before I went to bed.I am tired my body needs sleep but my brain will not let me rest.Every time I am nearly asleep it get head tingle that is so uncomfortable I can sleep. It feels so weired. Can antidepressants make you unable to sleep?,Depression
8025,All the friends I made in school had another friend that they were closer to or liked more. I was never anybodys first choice or number one. I always did my very best to be likeable and I was always a good friend but I just never found that in school. I was always jealous of the friend groups who grew up together went on to have huge weddings where everybody was included you know. A tight close knit group of friends that just click. All those groups you see in movies and tv shows. I did not have that. There was my sister. My sister and I were very close throughout our entire childhood and into our adulthood but recently our relationship changed and I do not think it will be the same again. I have a chronic illness now and I do not work outside of the home. My husband works for us. Its even more difficult to make friends now being sick. The pandemic made it worse. I did try chatting with new friends online but they would forget about me after a week and would stop putting in any effort. I was always carrying the conversation.I dunno. I have become a bit of an introvert over the years. I think I am fine with what I got. I have a huge family and I have nourished those relationships quite well. My husband tells me all the time that I am his best friend. Hes sweet. I do have one friend outside the family that checks up on me so there is that. I guess I just want to know if any of you have felt this way? I never had a lot of friends.,Depression
7303,I feel like I have always had one sided friendships. like I am always the one who puts in all the work. And it sucks because it used to hurt less. When I was a kid before I moved for the first time friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in we moved again. and again I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time a good job and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job I moved back to my hometown to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece's room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst. I do not even try anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed. If you are reading this know that I do not want to die. I do not want to stop living. my death would be too painful to people I care about. I would never do that to them. but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish I would ask to have never been born. obviously there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now. Rant. Down in my feels tonight. it is a long one.,Depression
9025,My brother called me all upset and then he hung up on me yesterday.Today my Mom got a call that he nearly attempted suicide and is in a psych ward detoxing from a relapse of being an alcoholic.I feel like shit. I wish he had just kept talking to me. I wish I had called back. Please call someone a hotline or just anyone if you are feeling bad. I hate that he did not feel like he could talk to me. I feel like a failire. Guilty about my brother,Depression
9066,I still live with my parents and I want to change my major. I am very unhappy with the major i chose. My mom says its too late now and that i must graduate and find a job. I have not given up so I am studying to a very important exam to get accepted in a new major but its so hard to study the whole day and not flunk in the classes that I take in college. I do not have much free time at all.I do not haven many friends never dated. I am too socially awkward. I gained 10kg in the quarantine. I feel that I am ugly now and that I will die alone and unhappy. Sometimes I think about dying and just wish I was never born. I am 22 and have gotten nowhere.,Depression
8506,I just need some support. I am dealing with a lot of stupid shit and it is piling up again. The worst of my problems is a head injury from over 3 years ago that is still fucking up my day to day basis. I get exhausted easily mentally and physically I cannot remember shit I am always in pain unless I take my prescribed drugs or drink and now people have been making me feel bad about it. There is nothing I can do. I am seeing a neurologist Friday. But right now I just need uplifting words. Please. I am so depressed today,Depression

7570,Not sure what to write but I am going to treat the comments like a mini journal because I have lowkey had one of the worst weeks or two of my life and it has all been self inflicted in the worst way possible. Even worse than that I am in a hole that idk how the fuck to get out of I have tried I promise Dissociative amp Depressed Mini Journal,Depression
7252,he tries to help me and asks me why i do not care. i said i do not know. i genuinely do not know why i do not care. he said i do not care about him and i realized i do not as much as i should. i try but i cannot. I am so tired and he brings up my issues whenever we talk and say that i cannot admit when I am wrong things like that. i have lost all interest in caring for people. I am so tired. how do i fix this? i do not want to lose my friends but I am so drained i do not care about my friends,Depression
7968,when they say that thinking about suicide is calmingrecently I realized that whenever shit happens I think well it does not matter because imma kill myself soon anyway and idk why it just makes me stress and worry less about the bad things I think I understand some people now,Depression
9123,Imagine if you wanted to die and you could just swap lives with someone instead. Maybe a 89 year old or a 5 year old. would not that be weird? is not it odd how some of the of us try so hard to die while others are doing everything they can to survive? Imagine if you could donate your life.,Depression
8475,I have had to be constantly dosed up on it for the past couple of days.So far it is been the only thing that calms the HELLISH itching from the sunburn on my back. If you have never experienced Hell's Itch go step barefoot on a fire ant nest and just let them bite. Then imagine that happening for hours on end in a place you cannot reach.Unfortunately Benadryl also sends my depression through the roof and my filter out the window. Not good when I am in the middle of a longdistance fight with people I love very much. I said some really hurtful things.I hate being an asshole. I hate that Benadryl removes my ability not to be. And I have no one to cry to about it so here I am. I mean I apologized but like... What good does that do? I am still a horrible person. I fucking hate Benadryl.,Depression
8312,I do not understand how people can think its okay to make plans with you. Know they have plans with you says they have to do something before hand then not text you the rest of the day and say sorry I was busy the next day. Like I am not mad they were busy but we both have phones and you could say hey I am not going to make it. Instead I got to waste an entire day waiting around. Maybe it is only a problem with the friends group I have but it just feels like no one gives a fuck about my valuable time. Rant,Depression
8759,Has anybody here had a bad mental breakdown? If in the past do you still reflect on it?I had mine last year I could not eat drink or sleep properly for about 3 months my hair thinned I lost weight no showers. As I was recovering my partner moved out while I was at work. I called the samaritants every other night just to talk to somebody.I keep thinking about it and I am in a much better place now but it is so damn scary. Mental breakdown,Depression
8672,No one takes my anxiety seriously. In my family it is no secret that I struggle with severe anxiety. I do not want to give too much detail but they do little things that make me feel like they really do not give a crap about my anxiety. Like how I hate taking pictures especially with other people because I feel selfconscious and literally feel like the ugliest person alive. I told them about it and they apparently understood. Then a few days later they force me Literally pull me by the arm to be in a picture with them that is not even important and I instantly lost all my trust in them.I remember running to my room afterward and bawling my eyes out. I did not even want to look at the picture. I know it is not even that big of a deal but it really affected my ability to open up to people because I felt that no matter how supportive they act they will never really take anything I say or feel seriously and I just felt like the biggest wuss ever because I mean it is just a picture right? why the hell am I so scared of a picture?Of course this is not the only thing I am dealing with. I really hope I am not the only one that is going through this but I do not feel human anymore. It feels like my mind has detached from my body. I do not feel present. It feels like I am floating and like I am not alive. Idk how to explain this but it gets even worse during stressful situations. I do not know what I want anymore. It feels like my body is trying to tell me something but I do not know what it is.I remember when it started. I had just had the biggest mental breakdown I had ever had and I just went numb afterward and that numbness has not gone away since.I do not know man. Life is just so fricking tiring and lonely. Just venting,Depression
8049,I am getting old now and realizing I have had dead spot decades in my lifetime. Memories of depression starting from age 5. Parent accounts of ND sensitivities before age 5.From age 1020 dead spot 0 productivity Then some brightness and progress from 2030.Then again 0 productivity from 3040. I am starting to see some brightness again now. I hope it lasts.Are these decadelong cycles common among people with depression? I am not asking for a diagnosis of course but I am curious is this pattern consistent with a different diagnosis besides depression? I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I am on medication for that and I have been on antianxiety meds before but not currently taking any now. I need to go back to a psychiatrist for further evaluations I just have not made appointments because the whole process feels invasive and kind of exhausting but I will.

8405,This is why people do not seek help. This is why people refuse to open up because they are constantly being let down. This is why its easier to keep everything bottled up. I express to my doctor that I have not been feeling the same for a while. I feel empty I have panic attacks I feel suicidal and it was met with Just take yourself to the movies. you will feel better. This is not a big deal. I will not prescribe you medications because I do not think you need it. Just try to get out of the house more. Now I am left feeling lonelier than ever before.Fuck you.We all deserve better. Everyone struggling right now I hear you and I hope you find and get the help you deserve. Your feelings matter. Attempted to seek help for severe depression anxiety and was immediately dismissed,Depression
7531,I am 20 year old male. I am struggling with depression for so long that i cannot even remember when i started feel depressed. I have been depressed my most of my life and never ever think that ending my life as a solution but in the past few mounths I have been thinking alot about killing myself alot because i cannot see a way out. I do not think I am going to be able to normal. I cannot even remember when i was normal like not even happy but normal. I am a virgin and never had any relationships. I have tried bunch of times but everytime i tried i got rejected friendzoned and sometimes got blocked. Last year i decided to stay platonic i said myself well if i do not propose i do not get rejected that worked not well but better than be heart broken. My past is full of pain and betreyal. My parents divorced because they cheated eachother. I was 14 when they got divorced and i kept all my anger inside then. I still keeping all of my anger inside because I am afraid to let it out i do not know what kind of monster would id be turning into and do not know if i ever be able to come back. Well that is my story thank you for reading it. I needed to write somewhere and this was the only place that come to my mind. is death really the only way out?,Depression
7661,Idk what subreddit to put this in so I decided to put it in hereWhy is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive or too inconsiderate too myopic too loud too shy etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny or too fat or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. Work on your self esteem or You sound insecure. Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just insecure?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities,Depression
7541,I have been attending university for about 5 years now bouncing between programs and failing multiple classes. This summer I was able to complete about three more courses and I could graduate with a general degree. Its about 3 days now until i would have had my last exam and I have not done schoolwork at all. This is something I am not interested in and I had no motivation to do any of my assignments or work and now its come to bite me in the ass. Luckily I got accepted to college in September for a program I think I am interested in. I could not find it in me to push myself to do anything for this I cannot stop thinking about how disappointed my family is going to be knowing I am a failure. The only reason I was doing it was so it would look good on my resume and to make my parents proud of me. Its so hard to watch people I went to Uni with graduate I envy their ability to put their education before their emotions and push themselves I could not and now that is 5 years of money and time wasted I just want to graduate and feel accomplished. I hate myself. 22f I have given up on Uni and I cannot stop beating myself up,Depression
8143,I am going through a huge rough patch right now and I know it will get somewhat better eventually. But the parts of my life where I am somewhat happy are so few and far between. It never feels like good times will last. Is living a life where 90 of it is pain and 10 is good really worth it? I do not feel like good times are worth waiting for,Depression
8973,I am just exhausted. About to turn 34 and so worn out. Life is good wife cool step kids good job. But my first memory is being in my room not wanting tomorrow to ever come. And that thought has never gone away. Medication and and a fast pace job makes things bearable but that thought never goes away. Repeating myself. Constantly. I am trying to live this life with normal people and all I do is let them down. You cannot just tell your family that you love them and that you do not want to wake up anymore. Worn out.,Depression

7155,I am a 24 yo male. All throughout my life I feel like I peaked really early on and either through selfinduced calamity circumstance or a combo of both came crashing down. Even though I have not lived a long time I already experienced a long term relationship sex life abroad college and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became selfgrandiose and deemed myself settling for someone below me whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees even though acquired from top universities do not mean shit when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a Introduction to Beer GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am my expenses are and will be for some time I think paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society. I might grow into an alcoholic with a severed lung but that is a bet I am going to have to make. I am not posing a question here. I am just writing down what I have been seriously thinking about for the past couple of months and I want to know your opinion on it. I think there is no way out vertically so I am thinking to change position horizontally before ultimately falling off the radar. Idk if any of these make sense to you folks. I am just very tired and bored and hopeless of life. Thinking of Retirement,Depression
8274,I have been dealing with depression since I was 16 and now I am 27. I have been eating sweet's for a long time. My sugar intake has to be through the roof. But just a few years ago I thought about suicide and I attempted it a few times. I failed. But instead I decided that I could not deal with the short pain of going through that and possibly surviving. Most people eat unintentionally to suppress their feelings or to feel better. But I decided if I am going to kill myself that is it is going to be slow and I am going to enjoy it. I have been overeating intentionally eating food to gain weight eating so much sugar that it is all I have got.Maybe I will stop but for now I am happy killing myself. I have been slowly killing myself with food,Depression
7321,I am a living fuck up. Physically mentally socially academically socially .If someone offered me the chance to never have been born and my consciousness to not exist I would take it in a heartbeat because I know the world would be a better place without me in it. I just wish I was never born. Thinking of doing more years of schooling then working 45 years being old for 15 then dying makes me sick. Why do I have to live?!! I am so angry and sad all the time. Every day I wake up is filled with fear. Anxiety anger and sadness. I wish I could never be born and forget everything,Depression
9047,I have been having depression and anxiety from studying. As a student I have always tried to get the best grades possible with that i was not getting recognition from my family but was still determined to aim higher the year later i started high school with a 93 average and ended with 98 average totaling it up to 96.3. I have always thought that when i get these grades i would get a good job or congratulations from my parents but i was fully depressed when i told them about my final term grade and did not even get a good job or attaboy which really affected me negatively and i was so sad that i had to confront my mother about this and we started crying and she said she would do better and thankfully it worked but it still lies in the back of my head wether or not if i had said this when my final grades are up she would appreciate or was my confrontation a wake up call to start appreciating me. Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies,Depression
7131,After breaking up with my partner I realized I have no friends but that did not bother me till recently. I am lonely but too scaree to get close to people. My anxiety gets really bad when I talk about myself so it is hard to open up... I am finally on meds and waiting for them to take effect I am just so tired I do not want to work and I do not want to see my family but as someone who lives in middle east I have no right to live alone without marriage so I have to stick to my toxic home environment...I feel like I am too unstable for friendships and yet I want it. I want someone local who I can share my thoughts to and be able to go out but I keep finding excuses not to get close to anyone and at the same time I have no idea where I should be looking. Why do I have to do things? Why is it so hard to just live day to day routines? I feel so pathetic and stupid I am lonely and exhausted,Depression

7612,I have been forgetting things. I feel stupid. I do things on time and then there are mistakes in them because of my forgetfulness. I am easily overwhelmed. I come across as careless. I switched medications earlier this year but I think it is gotten worse because of that.I would fire me. I am tired of myself. I complete a task but inevitably something is off about it no matter how many times I check. I have been at this job for several years and got a warning last year improved but now have fallen again.What the fuck is wrong with me? People tell me I am smart all the time so why do I keep messing up? I think I am going to get fired,Depression
8648,I have been trying to get an appointment with a psychiatrist for weeks and with nobody taking any new patients amid the pandemic I am left with nothing. I immediately panicked when I woke up this morning and started seizing. Refused to call the ambulance and drove myself to the ER despite feeling blacked out. Now I am nervous they are about to admit me to an inpatient center due to the nature of the questions they are asking. I genuinely do not want burden my family with these bills. Advice somebody 21F in the ER with intrusive thoughts,Depression
8476,I moved to a new country and I came here with my close friend. The few people I knew here once I landed were her classmates and I did not click with them I did not like their vibe their overbearing nature maybe I did not like that they were so extroverted. My friend had the same thoughts about them but did not do anything because they were her classmates And so naturally it showed and they do not like me back which did not affect me because they are not my friends and I do not interact with them in any part of my life. However now it has gotten to a point where I have become a laughing stock in her group they talk shit about me make jokes on me TO MY FRIEND and she laughs and agrees with them. My friend is known to be gullible people have told her that she knows it but it makes me extremely gutted that she feels the way she does. I also read messages where she told one of her friends that she is getting irritated by me. She told the same friend who is also her fuck buddy what if I turn into her? You tend to become the person you live with. If I did would you still talk to me? and so on. we have just moved to this place we had plans to explore this new country and do a lot of stuff but now that I have read about all of this I do not know how to react. I do not want to confront her because I feel that is always backfired with me as I am not good with words when I am angry and I might say something irreversible plus it is going to make living together difficult and I have no plansinterest in moving out we have had to struggle alot find this place. My childhood friend does not like me ,Depression
7958,Using my super burner account. I just want to get off my chest how deeply I yearn for the release of this mortal prison. I am too much of a coward to actually kill myself as I do not want to put my parents through such turmoil and guilt but its slowly becoming my plan to end it all once they both pass. Not to relate myself to an NFL athlete but the news stories about players that commit suicide and save their brains to be studied for the longterm effects of concussions is something I think about often. Maybe somehow the mess of my life could mean something and make sense if studied.Food for thought. Hug your familyfriends if you have got them When thinking about killing myself I would not shoot my head in the hopes that someone could study my brain and maybe learn something.,Depression
7106,So here goes. Posting online because I do not want to talk to anyone around me. I have struggled with depression and eating disorder since my teen years. I thought I beat itthat I was done with it all. 4 years ago I was diagnosed with ibs. Its been going up and down but lately I assume because of the heat my ibs has been horrible. I have to be so careful with what I eat. Otherwise it sets my stomach of. And slowly slowlymy ed started again. Its a sneaky fucking demon. Its like someone whispers in my ear are you sure you need to eat thathave you seen how much weight you have been loosinghave you noticed that your bones are showing more and more? Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morningI do not want to see peoplethey exhaust methey make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon. Is just hard when you thought all of this was in the past. And here comes the demons with their lies and horrible grins,Depression
7194,From year to year it gets worse medications will not help me anymore. What is called therapy here is actually an annual visit to the doctor for a new prescription Cheer up find a job. Great advice for a person who cannot leave the house and more than once passed out from anxiety when buying groceries. I am too old and worthless to try any further. I want it to be over. I will never be okay,Depression

7301,All I have to do is browse the reddit comments. You look like mom's neck beard basement dweller I would date your second chin. And I think that some of these roasts could apply to me. I am a woman. I have been told I am attractive. I think I am. I only weigh 110 lbs and I am 5'6. But I still have excess weight I gained after losing a pregnancy and being put on birth control. So the double chin comment really gets to me. Everytime I see a negative comment I think about how my closest friends could say or think the same thing about me. Especially since one of my closer guy friends is a guy I crushed on recently told and got rejected by in the nicest way possible. I have trust issues. I sometimes think I am not as great as I think I am in the moment. That my friends are internally roasting me in their heads while I look like an egotistical arrogant ahole. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Today's been rough. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation ever since I flirted with my guy friend again and made things akward. It seemed like he was flirting at first but I think I misperceived the intent in his speech and screwed up again. there is more to this story but I do not want to get into it. I cannot tell if I am overthinking paranoid and waiting for betrayal or if my intuition is on to some things. So I deacti everything. I am staying away. I personalize insults aimed at other people then want to die.,Depression
9126,Sorry about this being so long I have a lot in mind that I feel is all relevant to each other.I have been trapped in my house for months since I have left my job. I left because I did not feel comfortable being there and every passing day felt like a drag. I was not happy with the thought of me working 66 manual labor hours with only a single day off to really do anything for what might be the rest of my life. In hindsight I think most of the reason why I hated being there was because I was always drowsy. I would stay up really late because I hated work and would have to wake up early. The entire time spent here at the house since I have left work I have done absolutely nothing to try to improve myself. I want to go back to work because I feel like a bum for being unemployed but I just cannot right now. My biggest worries about going back to work are either that I am going to be fired immediately because of my general low energy caused by my depression or that I am going to be ridiculed endlessly by my future coworkers because of my awkwardness. I do not know how long Ill last working there with all the abuse I am undoubtedly going to get. I have thought about what exactly is it that makes me such an easy target of ridicule and I have come up with a few reasons. The number one reason is that I am boring. I have little to no interest in anything. This really sucks because I have plenty of ideas on what things I can get into to make me more interesting yet I can never bring myself to do anything about it. I GENUINELY do not care about anything and it makes me sad knowing that so long I do not do anything to improve Ill forever have this problem of being boring and being the constant butt of everyone is jokes everywhere. I honestly feel like I am undeserving of any human dignity with the way people talk to me. Like if I am not allowed to have any pride. I often question my intelligence for what I think are pretty good reasons. I graduated from High School with no intention of going to college because I was completely mentally burnt out by the end of it. To be fair I think sleep deprivation had a lot to do with it same reason as what I mentioned about work above. I literally told myself that I wish that I could turn off my brain and never have to think again. I do not know if its my sleep deprivation stress possible autism undiagnosed possible ADD undiagnosed or maybe even a learning disability but I have a VERY difficult time learning anything. My brain literally HURTS when i think about anything and I just feel even worse emotionally for not understanding it. This depresses me for many reasons. One being that I feel like a complete worthless idiot who will never amount to anything and who is a slave to manual labor work. Two It makes learning any skill more difficult tenfold. Three I just simply hate being stupid. I look up to the intellectual types. I value intelligence over any other human quality trait and it makes me sad that Ill never feel like I am good enough to have friends to have a soulmate to be a father one day or to even play a respectable role in society. Ill forever be some dumb laborer in the eyes of the people around me. Despite all of these things mentioned that bother me I just cannot bring myself to do anything about it. I cannot go back to work because of the mental state that I am in. I will not last. I cannot pick up new hobbiesinterests because I honestly do not care about anything. The abuse will never end. I cannot learn any skills necessary to improve my financial future and overall social footing. My brain hurts trying. I feel completely stuck. It does not help that I do not know anyone personally who would honestly give a damn about me getting better besides my parents. I think its safe to say that my siblings secondary family members and friends do not have any would not care. I am on my own here. I cannot bring myself to commit suicide just yet but I do not think Id be too bothered if I knew that tomorrow would be my last day alive. I do not have much to lose. I also feel like I am living a cycle that will keep repeating itself with no end in sight. Ill find a job that Ill hate but I muscle my way through it enough to be able to afford another break. Ill take said break but Ill feel like shit knowing that it was likely due to anxiety and Ill feel like a bum for being unemployed. But I cannot really learn anything useful to advance myself to a better future. So when the money that I saved up for the break is gone its back to working my miserable job. The cycle repeats until the day that I die. Any advice or possible words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. If I do not get a single answer then that is fine I am just happy to share this. I forgot to mention this earlier. I am 23 Male and I have had depression and social anxiety since I was 13. I feel stuck.,Depression
8145,I laugh but do not like the joke. I smile but do not feel happy. I walk around aimlessly waiting for the day to be over just to start the process over again. My mind is foggy and my body does not want to move. I push through each day hoping something will change.When does it get better?When will there be someone that is there for me and not because they feel bad? I am about to finish up my internship and feel worse. People say they are proud of me and it makes me cringe because I do not deserve it. I have been a failure all my life why would it change now?My birthday was during the internship and nobody noticed... and for some reason that brought me joy knowing that nobody noticed me. That maybe if I disappear nobody would notice I walked on this earth. it is weird that this brings me joy... Where is my mind?,Depression
7226,I am known to be a really upbeat happy funny easygoing person. I learnt to act like this and be a people pleaser at a young age and it just comes easy to me now. But I believe I have been depressed for a very long time however its never been diagnosed. sometimes I feel like I am almost just overreacting or like my depression is not really there and it does not help that its never been officially diagnosed.Sometimes I have days where it feels like depression takes over then the next day will be really good and Ill feel dumb for how I felt the day before. Almost like imposter syndrome but opposite. Does anyone else feel this way? Or any thoughts? I feel like my depression is fake sometimes,Depression
7530,I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life From when I was born to my senior year am currently 25 and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth freespirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 89 at the time this was happening Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 89 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated so I tried to fake being cool which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is for girls and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class She was one of the only people in my class let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person and some of my friends physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast all the while I was begging them not to. Thankfully she did not hate me for this8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this cool facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year the same group of friends from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. I do not even remember where I took one whiff and in the back of my head I just said that is it I am done with these guys this is not what I want to beI left that school with one friend that I had just made that year social anxiety and selfhatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least there was still bullying nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things I tried to own this one man wolf pack loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am. I still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold logical body.For those who took the time thank you so much for reading all of this any advice on what I can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated. Hopefully I did not come off as too whiny. Looking to share my story of being bullied.,Depression
7777,I have been living the same day on repeat for about as long as i can remember without trying to sound cliche I am in a hole that is just too deep to crawl out from. I do not know what to do to fix it and the longer I am alone just doing the same thing over and over the less i care which creates and endless cycle.I hate posting this shit on reddit because i know I am going to get into an argument with some guy and he will use it against me but yeah in theory i should be someone who is able to thrive and create a decent life for themselves but i just do not care anymore years of being unable to create and maintain basic human relationships and social isolation kind of ruined me as a person.And as I have searched around no one seems to have any real solution to this. Its always the same well no one ever said it was easy rome was not built in a day well! The situation,Depression

7770,First time posting here. There is so much on my mind. I just cannot find it in me to think I am worthy of anything. I work myself to the bone and get very little appreciation. Its really been taking a toll on me. I used to love what I do and now I feel like I am just taking advantage of. I have never been a fan of my appearance. Physical I have been overweight my whole life and recently been trying to change that but with the work I am putting in I feel like it does not make a difference. I just want to feel happy about myself but I just cannot seem to find anything to be happy about. Only thing that makes me smile anymore is my 3 kids. They are about the only people that make me fee appreciate in some way. That being said they usually want mom over me but I understand that. I am just been feeling worthless and I cannot seem to get myself out of the ditch of sadness. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any help given. How to find self worth?,Depression

7078,People are so fickle each persons reality is only upheld by judgements made on bits of information they get and everything they think they understand can be turned upside down with just one contradictory judgement brought about by another piece of information. Reality is relative and fluid and every experience interpreted determines individual reality. Like none of it matters. But I still hold onto my kids I do not want them to ever see the emptiness I do right now. Realities,Depression

Like a dark cloud of smoke. Slowly suffocating. No matter how much I am achieving its not enough for me. I always need more. Sleep is always too much or too little. All these thoughts in my head scrambling. All the bad times on repeat. There is not any breaks.I am accomplishing some amazing things why does it feel like I am climbing up a cliff?A cliff that cuts my hands every time I climb.Why do I feel like when this cloud comes around that it will never go away.I have forgotten the sunshine.I have forgotten the way it feels on my skin.The way it shines in my eyes. All I feel is my heart sink.Sinking into the depth of my chest. When I forget,Depression

I accidentally cut myself the other day and I did not mind the pain yeah it hurt but I did not care and that is just scary I am not going to start cutting myself on purpose any time soon but the fact that I did not even give a second thought to the inch deep cut that is now on my hand is way to terrifying to think about I do not know what to do.

7147,I am just so done honestly. The last two years have been shit I was forced out of a job suffered horrendously from bullying from my past two employers have been in therapy from it worked up the courage to get another job my role was cut by 30 hours a week and have been looking for work ever since I am so broke. I have been doing a course that has been extended by a year due to COVID lockdown after lockdown. I live at home I am not in a relationship I feel like a fucking loser. I have lost friendships made a friend who tried to make it more than friendship which was not what I wanted. I cannot go on vacation I just need a break.Today was the last straw I applied for two jobs weeks ago. I got one of them then they never replied for 6 weeks. I finally got a reply they told me they never recieved anything and blamed the mess on me I know the emails went through because they replied to me on that email address.I also applied for another job one I actually wanted. A job I was so excited for a feeling I have not felt in a long time. I was told I would be a great canidate I would work well with them. Today I got a rejection email before I was even interviewed. I am so upset and angry. do not comment 'It will get better' or 'it will work out in the end'. I am over that that does not help me now. I am so angry and have no idea what I am going to do in life. ampx200BTLDR I have no idea what I am doing in life I am sad angry and feel completely hopeless and depressed Why does everything always have to suck?,Depression
8187,I love sleep it is like a teaser trailer for death. I use to escape with drugs which I enjoyed alot but these days I cannot really enjoy them because I am older and my body is in shit condition and it irritates my system. Gaming barely works as a escape I really wish we had more advance VR these days that was indistinguishable from real life but that is at least a decade away or more. I do not know about you guys but sleep is pretty much my last great place I can escape from my shitty reality. Sleep the last great escape,Depression
8945,Mine is when my cat died. I still see the image of her sprawled out barely alive on the floor. We were with her when she died. I cannot seem to shake it. It was so traumatic. Its burned into my brain. How about you? What is a traumatizing image burned into your mind?,Depression
7299,So I am 15m I was in foster care for around 10 years have had depression for 2 years and nothing goes my way like say there is one thing that can make you happy for a long time and someone else got that and then that just fucks your day yeah that just happened to me my depression come mainly from family and life in general like I always really wanted a pc but my family cannot afford it and I know that then my brothers gfs family gave him a free pc and not going to lie shit like this always seems to happen to me and I am so close to killing myself i hate my self and I hate my life like seeing other people happy just makes me feel worse and I hate it like there a feeling in my stomach that just feels like shit when someone sends me something good that has happened to them especially when its family or someone I know I just want to die I want to kill my self and I am so close to doing it,Depression

8898,I just want to die.No questions asked.I just want to die and take 5 minutes for the whole thing . where is that reaper.,Depression
8502,I will not be able to experience what normal people do yet I get to suffer a thousand times more. Every day. I waste my life knowing I waste it and I will not get this dream life I thought my life was going to be like the first 26 years I spent on this life.I am currently 27 about to hit 28 and I found out last September right before I was going to turn 27 that I had a mild autism. 5 years prior to that I got epilepsy and I have been isolated from severe social anxiety and depression since 2011 which is the year I was diagnosed with ADD. While born with a stutter.I grew up thinking only my stutter was the only thing holding me back yet I felt like a fucking freak. A mistake of nature. But that I was going to at least satisfy my interest in cars by driving them have me amp my friends journey life together go to parties live my teens like a teen have girlfriends have a job and not have anything stand in my way apart from a bit of a bump in my speech. But that was not the case. At all. I have always been this very mute socially awkward guy everybody is scared of. Until they talk to me and find out I am not that bad. But with my inability to read so much socially I have to rely on others to start the conversation.This autism answers many questions. There are a lot of things I do not understand with this world when it comes to the social stuff. it is just so damn frustrating because even if I want to be social and have friends I just do not fucking know how to do it. I am so out of touch with so much on the internet despite fucking being isolated on it for 10 fucking years. Been so damn scared of social stuff that I have just played singleplayer games and watched a few youtube channels over and over and over because discovering stuff is also so damn... scary somehow. Everything just falls down and confuses me. Fucking everything. I get the impressions and how you should think to crash with each other. To name a few you should not be mainstream while being against mainstream is considered bad. do not be casual and to be hardcore can sometimes be cringey. I am just so confused so when I pick on youtube channels music artists and such I pick from groups of people I follow that I think are not mainstreamcasual and not edgy but in the middle and go from who they know. And how people find these in the middle or edgy people are so confusing to me. Same with everything internetmeme. Always wondered that. I feel so outside so lacking in everything. And in these 10 years I have made so much progress outside with my social anxiety but I keep failing and making it the other way when it comes to online. Multiplayer games are pretty much impossible. It feels as if I was not meant for this world,Depression
7599,I go to work I exercise every day I eat healthy I budget I pay my bills I sleep 8 hours every night I take my supplements I am two years sober I meditate I see my friends every week I go to therapy I use my gratitude journal every day I keep up with my hobbies I deleted Instagram and Facebook I keep up with my family I nurture my 5 year romantic relationship. And yet every single day is still a struggle. Every five minutes a little voice in my head says Kill yourself. what is the point of this elaborate balancing act if its still the same in the end? I am exhausted I really want to be done. Fighting tooth and nail every day,Depression
8652,I have not been able to sleep because I have been constantly crying. Heck I am still fucking crying. Just last night me and my sister finally spoke up against my mother. My mothers always been putting us down and telling us about how much she is sacrificed for us and I know I am supposed to feel grateful but the way she says it makes me feel like I am a financial burden and all this degrading has like internalized into a deep self hatred over the past 15 years. I had just graduated college and honestly I really cannot afford to live on my own because of my health conditions and that my state is very costly to live in. I would not be able to afford living on my own unless I risk my health and risk losing my dream of being able to do art. My hands will not be usable if I had to work 2 or more minimum wage jobs. And last night was just the final straw. I am so fucking sick of the same fucking shit and its like nothing I do enough is good enough to satisfy her. Oh you got good grades? Well my coworkers daughter was valid Victorian. Oh you are studying art? Well its not going to get you work and I know my coworkers daughters who are nurses now and make so much money. I just want to have some even if its just a little validation like maybe a good job or something but all I get is 15 years of self hatred a loss of my will to live. I swear the only few reasons I am still around are just personal projects obligations to hang out with people and the fear of death but at this point idk if I can take this shit much longer. I just want someone to tell me that I am not a failure. Is that too much to ask? I feel like no matter what I do its never good enough and if I want to do something Id end up where I started,Depression
7297,I do not like where I am at in this point of my life. I do not even like looking at myself anymore. I feel uncomfortable with looking at myself. I am so stressed from everything going on at home. I do not want to be here to live through it. Its kind of a pussy move but I am over it. I had confidence and now its being taken away from me again. I do not have the energy to cry either . I just want to go to sleep.I know I make these posts like all the time but its like I cannot do anything for myself anymore. I do not want to look at myself. I hate myself. If there were any easy way to kill myself I probably would have already been dead. But there is never the right pills blades never sharp enough no where reliable to hang myself I want to kill myself,Depression
8445,hi. i recently moved into my own apartment. i got a job walking distance from it because i do not drive. this morning i was let go something about I am not what they were looking for. its in a restaurant where they are supposed to be fast paced. they threw me into the kitchen day one with barely any training no orientation or anything. so yeah i was not going to be why they wanted until they gave me some proper fucking training. anyways my roommate said she would help with rent this month. and with the remaining check i should be getting as well as some help from my financial aid from college ill be fine for rent next month. but I am getting nervous. i still need money for things like my phone bill. and groceries. and i just feel like such a failure. like I am becoming useless and my roommate is going to hate me. i do not know i just need to find another job but its hard when i have to walk. this is not supposed to be a pity party or anything i just need a place to vent and express my feelings without loading it onto my friends or family who will probably think I am a failure lol. just hoping things will be better and I am overreacting. feeling helpless,Depression
8797,I have undiagnosed anxiety disorder and possibly depression too . Scared to admit it to my family. Scare that they are not going to take it seriously or make fun of me. And today I heard my father talking to his doctor on speaker. He was told that he has depression and anxiety. He was prescribed medication for anxiety and sleeping pills and that was it. Nothing about therapy or anything. I want to get treated but I do not want to only rely on medications. I am quite worried and disappointed because I cannot see how I or my father would get better that way. Is this normal to only prescribed with medication for depression and anxiety without any therapy ? Only medicine no therapy ?,Depression
7057,Anyone else feel like making friends in your 20s after university is pretty much impossible? I feel like a loser asking to join in with others like a kid who did not get asked to the party at school Friends,Depression
8271,I am not sure if this is a common experience of depression or not. I have tried searching online but cannot find anything.At various points of my life when I have been suffering with a bout of depression I feel so old.Like I feel as though my life is over my good days are behind me. First time I remember feeling like this I was 18. I feel physically old as well. My body aches etc.Was wondering if anyone else has this or if its something peculiar to me.I am 33 now so not young but not as old as I feel. Feeling really old,Depression
7371,I am the kind of friend who checks on or makes a conversation with my friends by messaging them and getting to know their updates. One day I decided to stop doing that just to see if someone actually initiates a conversation with me and wants to know how my life is going? its been 3 months and nobody has. I am depressed that nobody cares for me as much as I care for them. I am feeling lonely and depressed Why nobody sends in a hi how are you doing?,Depression
8460,What is around you right now? A photo? A comfortable place to sit? A beautiful view? A person who you love? What is around you right now that you can find happiness in?I have been printing photos of happier times like vacations family great views. I have been getting into gardening and have been finding little plants like succulents and cacti. These plants love neglect. Seeing these little things throughout my day have made the days where I am feeling a bit down kind of brighten up with the spark of a memory and give me hope to grow in the future like my cacti and succulents. I hope you are in a good place right now. If you are not I hope your day brightens up a bit and you have a better week Find something right now that is around you and makes you happy.,Depression

7029,Boyfriend deals with depression. Is not wanting to be alive. Affecting our relationship. I have tried to understand but I cannot see his position. Trying to be there. Please any tips I want him to be happy and be the best partner I can be to him but it seems like its lost. help,Depression
9021,I am over everything in my life. I just moved in with my best friend too be closer to a different job. I moved out of my apartment and moved in with my best friend because both it was closer to a new job but also because that i felt that apartment represented a horrible part of my life one where I put the barrel of my gun in my mouth 26 times but could not pull the trigger. But now I think that was a mistake. We were really close before her kids adore me and her husband got along with me. But over time I have damaged a lot of that relationship because of my mental illnesses and I think she resents me possibly hates me and the only reason she let me stay here was because her kids like me and she feels guilty because of how much I have helped them monetarily over the past couple of years even though I have never asked for a dime back and do not care about the money. But everything since I began moving in last week up through now says she does not want me here and now I cannot afford to move anywhere else. My depression is probably more fucked right now as I am writing this than it ever was in my apartment. I am tempted to take my truck out onto the highway and just roll it into the creek as fast as I can. That way nobody has to deal with me my shit life nor my depressive bullshit ever again. I am over it. I am over life. I am over it,Depression
9031,I lost each of my friends a few years ago and I still cannot go a day without thinking about it. It ended really badly with everyone.They were the only close friends I have had and before and after I was friends with them I have felt like an empty husk without a purpose. They still talk about how much they hate me and how much happier they are without me on social media and it hurts me so much. It hurts just as much as the day it happened and I do not know who I am or what value I have without them.Every day is a struggle to get through and I feel like I cannot keep living like this always suicidal and thinking about how the only people who is opinions I cared about do not care if I live or die.I have nightmares regularly of them all in front of me telling me how horrible I am. I have been seeing a therapist and on meds for a long time but it still feels the same.I do not know what to do anymore I just want to feel like there is a future like I used to. My only friends despise me,Depression
7118,It sucks.I had been suspicious that they would already excluded me when on social media I saw them as a group talking about inside jokes and life updates that everyone but me knew. And in a recent post someone confirmed that they have a new group chat.I have been under the worst depressive period ever after doing so well in 2019 and because I was not ready to socialize and talk about mundane things with them or joke around with them I told them I will just be with myself for a while. They were initially understanding and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them my closest friend for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context vaccination rollout in my country is slow transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too she works in the hospital. So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing we have been friends for almost 20yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he being the jokester that he was made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter and now he has painted me as this killjoy paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder extroverted and down to play whenever.Depression sucks. But having friends like that sucks harder. My friends made a new group chat where I am excluded ever since I told them in the original GC that I might not be able to interact much because I am having a depressive period.,Depression
8758,This is so hard and I feel like I cannot take it anymore...People do not really understand what is like to suffer from depression how mentally ill people are really having a bad time... its not like those who say hm i feel a bit sad today i am very sleepy i feel anxious i want to km i am so ocd i have such anger issues etc... nah its way deeper than that...

7316,I have never really felt like I belonged or that anyone really cared about me. My family is very bad at showing affection praise or even attention. As a child my parents were too busy working and raising my younger siblings to give me the attention I needed. Fast forward and all my high school friends abandoned me for their significant others. I was the only one who was not in a relationship. there is a reason I do not talk to them anymore. When I turned 21 I met my future wife. We dated for 5 years before I proposed. We married and after 3 years she wanted out. She lost her attraction to me was her reasoning. She left me in our home and she took our child with her. The only living creature that ever gave me unconditional love was my dog. She was really my only friend the year after my child was born. My wife withheld affection and intimacy from me when I asked for it. I had to put my dog to sleep because she had an inoperable tumor on her heart. After that I had no one and its where I am today. I am fearful that when I start dating again I am going be afraid of rejection or possible abandonment. Trust is very hard to come by for me and I am socially anxious to begin with. I just feel so worthless and beat down by life. I guess even when everyone around you knows how severe your depression is they do not care enough to try and help. Feeing abandoned by everyone,Depression
8522,here is the cycle1 Start feeling suicidal.2 Seek help.3 Get on some new meds and go to therapy.4 Start feeling better start getting interested in stuff start enjoying life. Start new projects. This time I am going to accomplish something!5 Meds start wearing off therapy no longer helps.6 Get depressed. Lose interest in everything.7 Start feeling suicidal. Repeat!What the fuck? How long does this last exactly? How does anyone else devote their entire fucking lives to particular disciplines or occupations or projects? And why the fuck cannot I maintain interest in anything for longer than a couple weeks without descending back into apathy and anhedonia? Why the fuck cannot I maintain interest in anything?,Depression
7115,I am just tired of being like this. lately i cannot quit thinking about how disappointed in myself i am about where I am at in life. none of my friendships or family relationships make me feel good anymore and i feel unfixable. i cannot put the energy into being close to anybody anymore and i barely know who i am. i just never feel loved or known lately but i know it is my own fault. i barely talk to anybody anymore and even though it hurts a lot i find myself too terrified to change.reading about the pandemic has me feeling so hopeless the past year had some of the deepest depressions I have ever experienced and i stopped dreaming of anything i wanted to do completely. even though I am trying i cannot usually think of anything i even want anymore.I have been depressed since childhood and its weighing so much on me lately to think about the life i could have had or to wonder if I have even tried hard enough to help myself. I am just so tired and i wish everything was different tired of everything vent,Depression
7361,I just had surgery for a potentially serious type of cancer. I have been in a good mood except for the first week when I was told the diagnosis. I made the mistake of consulting Dr. Google and it sent me into anxiety.I had serious bouts of depression 30 years ago and a few bouts since then. Six hospitalizations lots of med changes stress career disasters relationship disasters and substance abuse alcohol.I have been sober for many decades got to retire at 50 have no financial worries. Never got married and that one really bothers me some times. I was successful high average attractive sales for big corporations so had money. As a friend of mine likes to say Women are not looking for guys like us guys with morbid depression. God I had a couple women in my mid twenties that were so gorgeous and smart as hell but my behavior drove them off or I ditched them for a bottle.Anyways I am in post recovery have some post surgical aches and still waiting to hear pathology. I got sort of sad and moody this week. I think I will be in good shape I was Stage II with something you do not want to go Stage III. Actually I could be III because the pathology is not back yet. I stopped doing things I like to do painting going out into the forests fly fishing. I bought a new carbon fiber canoe a month ago you can pick up with your pinky. I have not set that boat in a lake or river yet this summer. I sometimes think my life was a bust I die without kids or a partner what was the point?Just venting sure things will get better. Move muscles change thoughts!Hope everyone is having a good evening. Peace. Just Had Cancer Surgery Had A Mini Relapse Of The Black Dog,Depression
8193,I put in my notice last week at the place I was working at. My last day was supposed to be Friday but they let me go today. I was a temp so there is nothing I can do or say. I was leaving because they had told me things would change and nothing did in the two and a half months I was there.I have another job lined up. I start on Monday. But I had financially planned on working 40 hours this week. I came back from a medical leave last week. I just feel like shit. I am worried things will not work out at the place I am going to. What if there are more lies there! What if my new manager ends up hating me? What if its really stressful there as well? I had applied to a lot of jobs and did quite a few interviews. This new place is not bad but its not what I really wanted. There was one company I so wanted to work for but they turned me down last Monday. I am still sad about that for some reason.I hate how I am. Too intelligent to enjoy dumb things but not smart enough to hang with intellectuals. Too mentally ill to keep a job long term and have a career but not mentally ill enough to get on SSI or even get into a comprehensive therapy program. Its like I am never right. No matter how hard I try my life always feels like its one mistake away from crumbling. I just want to stop being so damn sad. Left and Leaving,Depression
8500,I am 21 have bpd and hate my life. I have no friends no money and no will to live for anything. All old friends and exes in the past left me and I have no interest in finding new people. I have a horrible family life that is too long to explain. I just cannot find any joy or happiness in life and feel I have not since I was a kid. My sister killed herself when I was 19 and that was the thing that killed me inside. I have been dead ever since. I do not know what to do anymore. I really want to end things but I want my family to die first so it will not hurt them. I am 100 alone and truly have no one. Reading these posts helps but I just wish I did not exist anymore. Everyday is painful. I just want to know if its really true that people can come out of this. I want friends a boyfriend and a happy life but I cannot seem to have it. I am already dead inside,Depression
7900,I feel horrible all the time. I do not have fun with anything like video games friends going out or even with family. I just try to pass time anymore. I have an amazing girlfriend and I am scared of losing her or myself. There is nothing wrong in our relationship and she loves me lots. I still feel lonely though even with familyfriends and my girlfriend. I grew up in a shit household but I do not want to blame that no matter what I do I cannot break the feeling of sadness. I do not really know how to describe it but I hate myself and do not feel worth shit. I am scared to say anything to my folks so I am making this post. Sorry if there is bad grammar I do not feel worth anything I do not want to die but I do. I do not feel like I should be loved,Depression
7890,you have been procrastinating from more than a year you piece of shit! And now that ur responsibilities r buttfucking you you r tryna blame lockdown covid and isolation for this huh? How big of a coward you are you deserve to die. Nah wait you thinking about suicide from a few months? you coward tryna exit ur problems like that? Ever thought how ur family will feel?

Been isolating yourself from a year who needs friends huh? Just go lock yourself in the bedroom again and pretend to be good around others. you told ur parents but they do not care no one cares for you you ugly fat motherfucker no girl will ever like to be with you. you deserve to die. Just fuckin' die and end this shit once and for all. I honestly do not want any sympathy at this point.

I am sorry that I made you read such a long paragraph that does not even matterdoes not even make sense I am just insane. No I am just a dramatic piece of shit . I really hope you all have a nice day ahead. To all the people suffering with any type of mental illness I hope God gives you the strength to survive through it I believe you r strong enough. Once again I am extremely sorry for my rant. I have just gone insane maybenah tryna push my responsibilities once again. Just downvote this post. Peace Just Fuckin' Die,Depression
7111,what is the point of studyingworking or having a relationship if i know exactly what the outcome is going to be.Which is not happiness in my case. For some people it is easy to say Be yourself but they also has a list of expectations of my future that even i do not really care about. How is that fair? If you are a parent and you are reading this please do not force your expectations dreams on your children just because you had a miserable life because you had kids. it is not the kids fault to be born in a world surrounded by expectations. I feel like nothing really matters in life anymore,Depression
8808,One thing someone said to me after telling them some of the things I have been through is that I am actually one of the strongest people there is for getting through it and still being someone who spreads positivity. The thing is I am not strong. Barley anyone knows everything that is happened to me or about the void its left in my heart. I keep it hidden. I am a goofy type of person so I hide it with laughter. I try to make people laugh and do good things as a distraction. Doing these good things makes me feel better about myself for a short amount of time. Like I said though I am not strong. I constantly let myself get triggered and start remembering the trauma. I get so anxious sometimes that its hard to hide and I am so terrified of opening up about it to many of the people I care about because I am afraid of letting myself be vulnerable like that. I know its probably irrational but I am afraid that if they know the full story they will come to see me the way that I see myself as a result of it all. Yet on the contrary whenever I get anxious and start having flashbacks and stuff I want nothing more than to have someone to break down to and to be completely vulnerable with without having to worry about how it would change their perception of me. I wish I could just let it all out like a little kid but that vulnerability terrifies me. It results in a vicious cycle that I am aware is completely self inflicted I am like the author of my own misery. If I was actually all that strong Id be able to talk about it in detail without tensing up and getting sweaty and anxious. If I was actually strong Id be able to not worry about being vulnerable like that. The fact that I do not have that strength is part of what makes me loathe myself so much. Does anyone else relate to all of this? Are these signs of PTSD or depression or is all of this normal for someone with trauma in their past? I cannot stop letting my past haunt me,Depression
8864,on paper my life is good and i will acknowledge that but I have just lost any willpower i have to try anymore. i do not really feel like i have a purpose in life. i smoke weed all the time just to feel something. i go through these weird cycles where i get super depressed then feel back to normal and then ill get super depressed again and bc I have noticed that pattern i do not really feel like getting out of the depression. why the fuck would i just want to crash and burn and inevitably start feeling depressed again i just do not give a fuck anymore,Depression
8679,My mum was explaining to me that depression is a choice or excuse that people use. She was explaining to me that she was depressed until she decided not to be and decided to play a different character This is obviously very frustrating for me to hear as someone that is trying their best every day but still not meeting their parents expectations. A part of me is even wondering if maybe she is right and if I just tried harder maybe I could do better? My parents think depression is a choice,Depression
9090,I am curious about howif it works. Thoughts on gene testing,Depression
7644,Hi lately I have been feeling really depressed and I do not know the reason I have been crying for several days too. Some days are better fortunately but I feel stuck and worried about the impact of my mental health on my future. I cannot get therapy because my mom said I did not have problems when I opened up to her for the first time I am 17 btw I guess some parents are not open minded and understanding enough to understand mental illness. When I try to have fun I cannot enjoy it I always feel either sad or numb. I remember the times when I was not even feeling depressed like that. I hope it gets better one day but I feel guilty for doing nothing for it. I tried to read books about mental health but I do not have the motivation for it yet. I feel pretty lonely too I just have some support on the internet but nothing in real life because I struggle to open up to people. Feeling so depressed and hopeless,Depression
9055,I have been regularly cutting back drinking by large increments because I was seriously worried it might kill me if I went good turkey.One if my family members told me that I was more fun and better off drunk. Sober I get serious and focused. I have a drive to accomplish. I am not much a socialite. When I start drinking I loosen up and become really friendly and outgoing. I absolutely become the life off the party. But I started noticing I was drinking more and more and eventually I was getting the shakes when I was sober. Shakes headaches dark circles under my eyes irritable and I had NO coordination sober I could not motivate myself out of bed unless I knew I could get a drink in my hands immediately because I felt just so God damn awful.Decided to cut back and cut back and cut back. Been doing really well. I do not actually remember the last time I had drink I think it is been about a week now? I do not keep track I just beat myself up Everytime I break and then get right back on the wagon determined to do better.Hearing my family say I was more fun and easier to get along with though when I was drunk cut me deep real deep. I have since decided I do not need or want them in my life but hearing another human being say I should resume slowly killing myself because I was more entertaining and easier going. Drinking was killing me,Depression
8814,I hate everything about myself and my life. How do I stop? How do I stop hating myself?,Depression
7758,there is been a steady decline in my concern towards other people for several months and it is still getting worse. Before all this I cared about everything and everyone. I guess it was too much. Now all I want is to be alone. To not see anyone. But unfortunately I can never have a few days to myself. it is simply not an option right now. And the more I have to interact with people the more frustrated I get and the less I care. Anyone know what this is? I care less and less every day,Depression
9085,As I look back on my life I get overwhelmed overwhelmed to the point that I feel there is no point in trying I am only 22 I could have been perfectly fine if I would have followed through what was in my face at the time it was in my face this is all on me literally I spiraled down and I chose my own path heavy self improvement on the way I suck,Depression
9063,I am a loser of a woman who will never accomplish anything. I wish I was never born,Depression
8576,I am 34 years old it is sad that i have to joke about depression like crack a joke instead of telling how i really feel. I am screaming inside i lost my dad last year and it was a hard awakening we think our parents are invincible obviously not.. I miss him terribly and i just lost the only person that really gets me she is left me no explanation just gone now she was my rock. I force myself to get up everyday go to work and get through it just to come home to an empty apt no one to greet me just darkness and silence. I am thankful i have my mom she listens to me and her advice is taken whole heartedly. But i cannot fully express myself to her she worries about my happiness she wants me to be happy before she is gone so i tell her i am happy but deep down I am a mess idk i may be just ranting or whatever but I am getting to the point where the fake smiles the masks i wear to hide my feelings are not enough i just want someone to see that I am trying I am trying I am trying but no one ever does I have always been the one that listens and tries to help anyway i can. Idk what to do anymore No title,Depression
7696,life sucks. i do not have a car a job i hate going to. i have anxiety every time i have to get a lyft to get there. i do not have credit and make no money to pay my share of the rent. i hate feeling like a financial burden. i dropped out of college because i cannot afford it. i have no hobbies and just feel like a waste of space. Just need somewhere to be sad.,Depression
9005,I just feel so utterly empty and alone. Do you guys ever feel like this? It feels like there is a black hole inside of me slowly eating away at me and taking my soul.I am 22 and I cannot make friends or get a girlfriend. The loneliness just gets more crushing every day It feels like there is an actual hole in my chest,Depression
7455,My boyfriend has been leading with depression for some years now we have been dating for 8 months and in this time he was quite okay when we started the relationship he was taking antidepressants and sometime after he dropped them but now he is getting worse again I have noticed it and he also talked to me about the topic.I am really worried because although I know that is normal and there is nothing I can do about it I love him and I do not want him to suffer he also is thinking about taking the antidepressants again even though he really hate the dependency that they create and how they make him not feel himself at all.Has anybody gone through a situation like this earlier?Does anybody has any kind of advice?PS I have not experienced diagnosed depression myself but I have been through some kind of depressive episodes and spent time with many people that was leading with depression before so I am quite conscious about the topic My boyfriend is getting worse again,Depression
7775,Does anybody else experience this? I have depression and generalised anxiety disorder and am medicated with duloxetine 120mg. Even with all this I get these strong waves of sadness every now and then where I cannot stop crying. I have just had one that lasted an hour where i felt utterly hopeless and lost. Now I feel calm and those thoughts have passed. Does anyone else have this and what do you do to get through it? Uncontrollable crying,Depression
7850,I have not been diagnosed with a mental illness nor pretend to have oneI just feel like I have ruined my life and I feel like Its too late to change anything I have stopped doing any sports because I feel likr I will let the team down I always get terrible grades at school and have trouble staying concentrated I feel like I will not be able to get a good job in life or get any job now because of this I cannot sleep at night because i think about what my future will be and how much of an incel loser I will become my friends never want to do anything outside of school they just want to play video games i was a shy kid growing up and was scared to talk to people or make friends. I am never going to get a girlfriend I am too shy and My personality is shit and I am fucking boring I just hate myself and want to press the restart button on lifeThis probably sounds pathetic downvote all you want I feel like i have ruined my life,Depression
9089, I have suffered from serve anxiety ever since I was 17 years old and I was diagnosed with depression once when I was 18 and I somehow managed to beat it back then. Anxiety never left me it is been there ever since but I learned how to manage it. Now I am 23 years old trying to get out of my parents' shelter. Unlike a lot of people here I believe my problem is not with myself but the people in general. You might say that statement in simple words just means I have a problem with myself but I do not believe that anymore. I have not had a lot dark thoughts during these past 5 years but now it seems they are back. I have been contemplating suicide a lot lately. The only thing that holds me back is my family. I do not want to hurt my parents and my younger siblings because I know that would be devastating to them.I am ashamed at myself because I should be making my parents proud and be a good role model to my siblings and not be a crybaby on this subreddit but here I am. I feel hopeless. I lost some good friends I hardly had any relationship that lasted longer than 3 months. I was cheated on and I was betrayed by people even best friends I considered as brothers. it is like everything has happened to me what is left?! I got in conclusion that this world is full of egoism narcissism and cinism. I think trying to be a good person never works here. This world is full of hate and full of people whose only intention is to fucking destroy other people. Everything is meaningless. I think there is nothing left for me here absolutely nothing. Why keep living in such circumstances? Why live among these people? I feel such a stranger to everyone. I am tired. I am so tired of holding on. I am so tired of keeping these things inside. I am so tired of hanging around people acting like I am not crying every night and day. it is been two goddamn months it is not leaving. I need to see a bright day for once ffs this is cruel. TIRED,Depression
8369,All this time I knew something was wrong but I never really knew what. I thought I hated my body I thought that I was sad because the boy I liked did not like me I thought I was sad because my parents never understood me. But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting and while my friend cried I started laughing because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw to read to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied I drank O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me if someone hurts me if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late to eat too much or too little to feel tired all the time to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different I do not know my feelings or myself. I do not really know or want or feel anything. it is the strangest feeling and I know it is been there all the time but I never recognized until now. I think I have been depressed for years but I did not know,Depression
8216,I have found myself in a mental rut lately. It seems to come in cycles. I have spent most of my days in bed. Have been canceling dates. Been ghosting the ones I care about. I do not know what to do. I am wasting my 20s worrying about things that have not even happened yet. I do not know why its so hard for me to accept happiness or allow people to love me. I think I have been down too long that I have started to glamorize being sad. Shit post,Depression
8164,Recently I have been trying to get my shit together for instance stop comparing myself to others see the good in things first not the bad understanding where I fit in in the world etc. But as a long term sufferer of this disease I believe I can never fully change how my mind thinks the traits which I am trying to change feel too deep rooted in my brain and the constant daily reminders of what put me in the position my mind is in now seem to wipe any thoughts of change or positivity.I fear I am going to be stuck like this for the rest of my life.What the fuck do I do. My mind is too far gone,Depression
8642,Who else knows the feeling of going into a new place but knowing that the new people you will meet you will disappoint when they get to know you? I started a new job and while I am still looking for work from home jobs this job is so hard to wake up to every morning. The work itself requires a lot of emotional labor and is the kind that does not finish. People were nice to me here at first but the way that I am I do not act the way I look I guess. I am way too shy do not take risks naive. Now its lucky if people look my way. I was never good with people and coming back to work with other people reminds me of that and its just frustrating all over again. I get headaches at the end of the day. And then I have to do it all over again the next day. I tried this job but Ill need to find something new. Its a cycle,Depression
7341,How i lost my dad3 years ago when I was 13 years old my dad got in to a really bad accident. My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck skull spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work he could not and still cannot his sports cycling running swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man one of the toughest sport races in the world. With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation. Right now I feel like I have lost the man who was on my side for the biggest part of my life. How I lost my dad,Depression
9096,My friends and I used to hangout and have fun. Now its just boring. We sit at their apartment and literally do nothing. I know I am going to be told to pull my own weight and come up with something fun for us to do or spark up a conversation. I have been their tried that does not work. I am coming here because its honestly sad and I am just losing my interest. Maybe I should move on and get other friends the problem is we live in a very small town and there really is not many people. I do like going to my aunts house though she is awsome and I go there quite frequently. So maybe Ill just ditch the friends and go see her more and more often. I just wanted to see other peoples take on this. I do not know if I am the only one with this problem or not but well see. The spark though with hanging out with my friends is not there anymore. Ill be sitting there wanting to talk but then I stop my self because it is not worth it anymore. Their usually on their phones and its just the same old shit different day. I hangout with them maybe like once every two weeks. It used to be more. They usually ask me to hangout more than that but I say I cannot because I do not really want to because its going to be the same shit every time. I do not hate them and some of them I have know for like 10 years but it just is not the same anymore. My friends are boring and I have lost interest,Depression

8282,I have not been diagnosed but I know I am suffering things that used to be easy eat at me from inside. I push all my friends away from me I have been meaning to change my bed sheets for over a month I feel filthy I do not want to take care of myself the only reason I shower occasionally is to look presentable for once in front of my parents. Every day I am ashamed of myself and crushed by guilt from what I am unable to do because it should be so easy. I am so ashamed of myself.I have tried talking to my parents but nothing's come of it. I have talked to my mom several times and asked her to maybe look at therapy options for me but nothing's happened I feel like she thinks I said these things to her only for attention but I did not . She told me I need to stop looking for other things to blame my hardships on. I have had conversation with my dad and he acknowledged me in the moment but did not bring it up again afterwards. I am tired of not being taken seriously. I am too embarrassed to ask for help again especially since I have been trying to hide it from my parents so I guess they think I am fine now. I feel embarrassed that I need help. How do I do it myself??If it matters I am 17. How to get better without help from others?,Depression
9100,So I have been thinking about this for 'bout 2 years now and since approximately 6 years or so I cannot get sad anymore. Of course I tried to search for it in the internet already but the only causes I could find were things like trauma which I certainly do not have. Thank you for your potential reply cannot be sad?,Depression
7851,I feel like it is just over when I failed university what do I even do now. Apply to another one? Like my parents had said but from them it feels more like the degree worth more than whatever is there to do. I do not know I feel like my scope of the world just constantly shrinking and I want to just end it. I am useless. you are young so have more energy does not apply to me I feel like I am mentally had given up on myself long time ago. cannot do anything well well enough,Depression
8845,Why do we even love people when they are always bound to leave and we tend to screw up relationships even when we loved them?The pain is just way too much. I cannot deal with it anymore. As someone who never felt love before to see the person you loved with all your heart leave and that too owing to your own fault is extremely heartbreaking. Although I am numb to the pain now I do not think I can function properly anymore. I just want to talk to someone anyone. Please. why does love exist?,Depression
7175,you are lonely. I get it. I am too. You might have friends family a bf or a gf people that you love.. but you still feel lonely. Like no one can even understand a tiny bit about you about what you feel and how you live. it is like you are stuck in your mind in a thick fog that nobody can enter and that you will not even try to leave. You might have hope. You might not.But tell yourself that we are thousands and thousands feeling just like you. We all have our little foggy mind of our own and we are all stuck in there and nothing each of us feels is the same as someone else. Pain cannot be compared. We all feel it differently.So even when you are alone. Even when there is no hope. Think about all the other. Who are keeping this fog at bay as hard as they can. Think about us who are struggling to survive. Thousands of us are gone.. but even more even still fight it. So do not let go. We might not be together but we are all linked somehow.you are not alone. you are not alone. Even if you are alone.,Depression

7077,Guys idk where else to turn to with my feelings right now. I am just so frustrated. I have been in my antidepressants for 6 weeks now and I am not doing okay this past week. Idk if its the circumstances of my life right now or if my medication is not working.. basically my mom was supposed to go to rehab so I dedicated 2 days to try and help her get ready and bring her to the airport. Well something happened at the airport that was neither of our fault and she said she did not want to go anymore so that upset me and I cried the entire way to her house which was an hour. Then my cat has to have his leg amputated and its going to cost us 1000 or more after everything is said and done with his er visit preop exam and surgery My sleep schedule has been messed up and it gets worse everyday. I sleep till 4 in the afternoon and I am ashamed of myself. I feel disgusted by myself honestly. I start school august 18 and part of me feels like I cannot make it bc of the way I am dealing with stress rn. I am over whelmed and now I am discouraged and that makes me feel ever worse. I hope someone can understand what I mean. Its almost like I am sad BECAUSE I am sad in a way. I am in therapy but I did not get to make it to my appointment yesterday because of my sleep schedule and also staying home with my cat. I have no friends and I feel like I annoy everyone so that puts me into antisocial mode. I just want it all to stop. I was doing so good the first 4 weeks of my meds and slowly it got worse and I feel I am right where I was before and I am scared that I am ganna have to be depressed forever bc medication is not working . I am sorry if this sounds dramatic but its literally how I feel. I feel like trash,Depression
7202,Hey been awhile since i posted and i would not say I am much better since last time. I just wonder why i feel alone all the time. sure I have got a small group of guys that are great friends but it does not seem like they actually care about me at all. Its not an obligation to check up on me i know but it just seems like I am always the one checking up on others when here i am feeling alone depressed i share things with them which i feel would make them happy but no one really does the same no one really listens you know. Is it in human nature to be selfish? why does everyone i know only put themselves before others including me all the time because it sure feels that way. I am not tryna say I am the most selfless guy out there but i do my best.. all I am trying to say is i just want someone to care to listen i just want to feel appreciated and that i mean something to someone. I am sorry if i meant anything in a rude way i hope you understand. Thanks for reading and have a good day. Friends,Depression
9109,earlier this evening my mom had a stroke her memory was all around the place she collapsed and her arm was not able to movemy mom is so special to me she is been helping me with life and I have recently just came out as trans to her she was so accepting i love her so much my moms life has not been easy at all 2 of my siblings are in foster and she is had cancer and numerous bad relationships i just want her to see me flourish and i want to see her more she is my only parent who understands and helps me i sound so selfish but she was the only person i was hanging on to and now that she may die I am afraid of what ill do to myself I am lucky for the time I have had with her she was expected to pass 4 years ago i really do not want to live with out her it will devastate my family and it will be a constant reminder the most lovely person in the world has been taken away when her voice is not there I just got the news my moms tumour is back and i have no clue how to handle myself,Depression
8184,Hey I have been suffering with depression since my early teens and I have just hit a slump with every aspect of my life. I feel awful all the time I have lost interest in all of my passions and my motivation is short lived. I am constantly surrounded by people who ask for my support but never actually show that they care I have hardly any friends and the ones that do do not seem to care. Normally I would be the supportive friend but at this point i really cannot be arsed with any of it nor do i care about their problems anymore.it is getting harder and harder to put up with people's shit I am angry at everyone around me but I am even angrier at myself. I feel useless sleeping for 12 hours though i could get up after 8 because there is nothing in the day for me to care about except sleeping. I am becoming more and more angry at everything,Depression
8598,I met a guy from Tinder three months ago and I like him a lot. He says he feels the same but he does not show it. Were both in our late twenties and both want a serious relationship. He confessed he was feeling depressed and that is why we never see each other 5 or 6 times within 3 months why he takes hours to answer messages while always online why he is not more involved in the relationship. He was not like that at the beginning and I am not sure if he was already feeling down at that time or not. I have been having difficulties trusting people because of one past relationship and I am not sure I believe him 100 although I really want to. I also really want to keep him in my life and start getting more serious. How can I support him especially so early in the relationship and considering the fact that he cannot give me the relationship I want? He says he cannot offer me consistency that he could make it work one day and lack desire to do so the next. I have no idea what to do and how to do it. Helping my depressed date,Depression
8075,I do not know where to begin. It feels like there is too much to say and it all feels complicated. I do not understand myself first off so it will be hard to explain my feelings to those reading this. I cannot exactly identify my feelings a lot of times. I used to feel true joy the kind of joy where I felt alive and vibrant. I think I lost this kind of joy in about 8th grade or freshman year of high school. I now am graduating as a senior and I still feel the same way. Its not like I am necessarily sad. I can feel ok but i will never feel like the funny girl who could make someone light up from my jokes and personality like back then. I can never feel completely alive. I can never feel completely like myself. I guess along with this its like I never feel truly happy? I am confused on when I feel happy or not. To be honest maybe I am never completely happy. Its confusing. I would say actually that I do feel happiness but its artificial. Its still really cool in those moments when I feel that type of happiness but it just is not enough? Its like I cannot feel the same with people as I used to. I cannot bond with people the same. Its like I feel robotic almost in conversation? Not much emotion is there lol. I would say that with sadness perhaps there is always a gloomy disposition lingering in the back of my mind. Maybe for so long its so hard to identify it. For so long I have also felt bouts of anxiousness. Even now maybe anxiety is apart of me and its lingering in the depths of my mind I cannot reach out towards because I can barely even identify it. At this point in my life I am just scared Ill be like this for a very long time I simply do not know if I would want to exist if I knew Id be like this for the rest of my life. I already feel doubt in life but its because I am so young and just getting into the world and discovering it that I have hope hope that Ill change and that Ill go on to do great things and experience great things. I am so worried though I am worried of different things at different periods of my life. It seems like I have new anxieties here and there while simultaneously feeling a sense of uneasiness always inhabiting the back of my mind I guess. I am just not me anymore. Life looks grey I guess. I guess its looked like that for so long that I feel odd even bringing it up like perhaps its just not true because this has been my normal for so long. Sometimes I feel like I need mental help but then feel stupid because I feel as though maybe there is nothing much wrong with me but what makes me realize truly that there is probably something wrong with me is the thought of staying like this forever. It makes me not want to exist anymore and whenever I come to that realization I immediately know something is not right. I remember whenever I was talking to a nurse about how I felt but its as though she brushed it off as simply being my personality. It felt wrong and I hope its wrong. I really hope I will not stay like this forever and that its not just my personality. It does not feel like that. It should not be like that you know? I think I should add that I was on Prozac since the end of my freshman year until I think the summer before my senior year btw! Maybe that will help But I came here because I really would love to hear some advice overall. What am I experiencing and how do I even get out of this mess? How do I feel alive again? What was it like for you? Just anything at all helps thank you so much lt3 I have not felt like myself in so long,Depression
8701,I am sorry if my title offends or triggers anyone that is not my intention.I am not personally suffering from depression but someone close to me is. I never thought of this before but I wonder what the consensus is Can everyone get better? If someone is struggling with deeprooted issues that have grown over decades can they be fixed? What is the standard for getting better? Is it living a normal life? Is it for bad cases just being able to function to a degree with permanent support from professionals and medication? Do some people just have to learn to cope with their issues for the rest of their lives?I saw a documentary on euthanasia for mental problems two were relatively young girls with depression. They had indeed lost all energy and will to fight. I wonder was there really nothing left for them? Can everyone be saved? Are there cases that are just beyond help?,Depression
8296,Hi my names Isaac and I am here to tell my story of depression anxiety and stress. Currently I am 15 years old and these 3 sins somehow disrupted my body it all started through 1 strawberry edible in May 1st and my mom gave me Xanax for me to calm my self down from the edible and it worked because it knocked me out for the whole day. But the next day my left side of my chest was hurting bad and it scared me because it felt like a heart attack and I had a panic attack so I had to go to the hospital I got their they checked me out and my blood pressure was 180120 but the doctors told me to calm down and gave me a pill and sent me on my way but the day after that my sides was hurting again and I was scared like I was going to have a heart attack again and then I went to the hospital again for the same reason the doctors did an EKG on my heart and they said everything was normal and my blood pressure was little high again I think it was 140 but then they sent me on my way again but If you guys did not know my parents are currently going thru a divorce too so yeah. But couple weeks later my left side of my chest still hurting but wait I start to get lightheaded more afton now and I had also got tested positive for COVID too now that is crazy shit. I got thru COVID and blah blah these symptoms still happening and there making me depressed because it scares me to think I have to live with these symptoms forever and I do not want to and it scares and makes me get depressed with life and i go to the doctors for this and she prescribed me serpentine and suggests I get counseling but I want to know your guys opinions plz lmk this stuff is eating me Alive Help me find my cure,Depression
8014,I cannot manage to make my happiness stay for a long while. Something within me is pulling it and now I am just so used at depriving it came in naturally myself from smiling. It all started last year it has something to do with a major decision in my life. During the last 5 months of the previous year I never let my mind go idle I get myself busy with school works but the pain just resurfaces and it sure feels legitimate and new. Fast forward to this year half of 2021 had passed I thought I would be able to move forward as that is what I have fervently prayed for during the preceding year to my disappointment it is still the same. I am not surprised either I always knew when I firstly experienced it that this pain will never fade away it may subside but it will surely regain its intensity and resurfaces once again. I cannot open this to someone else they would just simply say to get over it. Well I KNOW that I have to but it still really feels heavy and heavier as time marches on. I honestly want to isolate myself for a moment I want to have that episodes and years of solitude in my life where I let these thoughts run on my mind continuously without worrying about wasting such time that I would supposedly for being productive with the hopes that it would be of help to evaluate and make me feel more at ease and to move on. My issue might be too petty to some for it to be shared but please this is only my safest space to somehow breathe.I need help I cannot cry anymore it is tiring and there are no tears left. I am literally dead inside Idk what to do regrets,Depression
8986,I was diagnosed with Depression in late 2019. I had a rough year and was not functioning like I was. I started taking meds for both Anxiety and Depression and they have helped me out. However their are days where I am just completely down even getting worse than I was. I hope these feelings are more temporary and I still see progress with my mental health Been living nearly 2 years with depression. Life can still be a struggle.,Depression
7645,Over the years I have tried to put so much effort in improving my mental health. I have tried meditation dieting exercising medication whatever. But everything I have done has been pretty much in isolation without any sort of validation or positive affirmation from other people. I have no friends my parents do not understand what I am going through and everytime I relapse it gets harder and harder to pick myself back up. I am not exactly a defeatist but god I am so exhausted from having to do this by myself. it is really hard to get better without a support network.,Depression
8275,It has been three years three years of daily job hunting. I have applied everywhere tried everything been at countless job interviews answered to a gargantuan number of job calls and still I am here unemployed. I have graduated a few hours ago and now I am curled in bed sobbing my heart out.My lease expires on 31 July. Within three days I have to leave this flat and I have nowhere to go. I will be forced to go back to my abusive mother's place next door with my rapist on the other side of the country hours away from my fianc. I cannot express in words the amount of pain fear and despair that I am feeling.I have suffered from a severe form of depression since childhood. I have been increasingly better after moving away from that place. It has been a slow difficult path but I was betterbetter for real. And now everything feels like it was just a taste of the freedom and the happiness I will never achieve.I proposed to my fianc on the first of January just a few minutes after midnight. I have never felt so much at peace as when he said you already know that it is a yes!. he is not a very affectionate person but earlier he saw me in this state and tightly held me. He asked me to tell him what I feel and I just replied like I am slowly walking towards my end.All of this because I cannot find a job a whatever job just a job. I applied everywhere and in the end no one ever wants to hire me. I feel undesiderable useless and pathetic. Am I just a waste of space? Am I just a waste of life? I cannot go back to my previous life. I cannot keep surviving in hell after tasting how it is outside of it. My heart is slowing shattering again and I cannot hold it together anymore. Nobody wants to hire me and I feel like I am slowing dying of heartbreak... quite literally,Depression
8355,it is what the title says I guess. I have read the community rules and I hopethink this fits here. If not I am sorry and please just delete it. Anyway here is my deal I have always had low selfesteem and a pessimistic worldview. In the last few years Ive been working on getting better I managed to land my dream job have some good friends a supportive family etc.Then the pandemic hit and I had to move in with my parents who live in a small town far from my friends and I am now about to lose that dream job I had since it was a. freelance writing gig with an expiration date. My contract is only valid till October then I am SOL and have NO IDEA what I am going to next. Anyway this is just to give a little context about where my life's at rn but the thing is that I have been able to deal with everything so far but for the last idk how many days I have not. I have been having trouble sleeping and I have to absolutely force myself to do anything sometimes I am able to sometimes I am not most of the time I lay in bed and watch stuff until around 2am then I go to sleep and start all over again. I have also been crying a lot out of nowhere and have this sense of dread and hopelessness all the time. I do not want to do anything I do not feel like talking to anyone and I just wish I could just not exist anymore. IDK I guess I am just wondering if that is just regular sadness about my life being in a bad place right now or if I might benefit from getting professional help and asking for support. Thanks! I need help understanding if what I have been struggling with is actually depression,Depression
7714,So I was listening to Island Song from Adventure Time while I was sad and it got me happy just by listening to it. Then I thoughtThis song helped me when i was sad why not create a playlist with the same energy?From people who became happy because of a song to people that are sad right now.Maybe it sounds dumb but the impact music has in our lifes is incredible so if you want to contribute here is the link 3If this post violates ANY of the subreddit rules please contact me and I will editdelete it. I want to help people not because trouble xD Help me create a playlist,Depression
9075,One day I just want to get a knife and cut and cut and cut my arm apart. I just want to see the blood that will leak out the numbness with slight pain afterwards. While my consciousness will finally rest and be at peace and I can leave this world I want to rip my arms apart,Depression
7754,there is something i need to get off of my chestTo be honest I am impressed and with all do respect i contest that I am not depressed.I have never been impressed when writing thingsAnd possessed to inevitably suppress all the addressed that is molested my headAllowing me to feel just a little more dead.Inside i climb To try and reach my mindThe sublime chime of a cheap rhyme ill apply and provide to my aching and breaking blind mindIn an attempt to cover up the pain.But it never works it sticks to me like my name.It feels like i can never get away.I am tired of being here. its been establishedIts crystal clear that there is an imbalance taking place right in between my ears.But it feels so much more so much unexplored.Is it wrong to hope tomorrow ill not wake up left to explore the whore that is death on my cold concrete floor? Unhappy Unsatisfied. And completely dead inside.,Depression
8391,I am so FUCKING useless I try to act like things are normal and then some shit comes along to show how much of a fucking waste I am if people screamed and got angry I coupd at least take solace in that but they ACT LIKE I am NOT A WASTE OF SPACE AT ALL fuck I feel like I am spiralling a little and just withdrawing deeper in myself I hate being myself so much being so fucking useless Useless useless useless useless,Depression
7798,I was on ssri for about 3 years when I decided I did not need them anymore in spring this year.I felt great on them and they helped me profoundly. But I felt that I owe it to myself to try and live without it since my whole environment has changed for the better since I first became depressed.Now I start a new adventure by moving to a different place with my bf.Ever since we started planning everything I soon realized how anxious I got. never felt that before but I was on ssri the last few years. Now I feel mild symptoms of my depression coming back. I can still do my daily tasks do sports eat healthy and other activities but they are not as fun anymore and my job starts to annoy me so much.I really struggle to find out if these feelings are just normal since I am going through a stressfull phase and have not been able to experience these feelings as I do now because I was on medication or if I am just depressed again and maybe need it.Has anyone else experienced something like this? What was your solution? 4 months off ssri and moving,Depression
7185,I do not know if this is the right place for this.I just feel sad a lot the only time I am not sad is when I am with friends but as soon as that is gone its like a switch and I am sad again.I want to feel justified for having all these sad feelings and I do not want to get up when I have all these good things around me. So sometimes I want bad things to happen to me like I just wish something bad could happen so I could feel justified and wanting bad things to happen makes me feel like attention whore.I just feel like I have it much better off than most and I am selfish for feeling sad all the time I just wish I could just appreciate what good things I have but I cannot and I do not know why.I am really sorry this is probably all over the place and does not make sense. Why am I sad when everything is good?,Depression
7929,I have a rivalry and my rival is winning. Its causing me to spiral.My SI is out of control. I am so depressed. I cannot function normally. Its been 4 days,Depression
8600,My parents hate each other.This girl I thought might have been the one left.I moved to another city just to see this girl she still did not see me for 3 months and then we broke up.My parents moved here too. Now they are getting separated and my Mom is going back to her brother's place. My father is abusive and lost in his life blames her for everything. What I do not get is why am I cornered like this. Nothing is going rightI stay demotivated and do not perform as well as I can in college. When I try to something like this happens.We have a dog Hana. My mother is everything to Hana. Idk what she would do if my mother goes away. My father does not take care of Hana that often. My mother loves Hana and she is probably the only one Hana loves that much. Idk what Hana would do. My mother is nearing 50 idk how she is supposed to live alone. Fuck this. I honestly do not know what I would do if this actually happens. Is it possible that sometimes life is not supposed to be good ? You keep expecting it to be and one day you just die. You cannot even control the things that are making it worse. what is the point ? Nothing is going right in my life. I am stuck.,Depression
7728,I have two days off work. I am mentally exhausted from work but not working I just feel like I stagnate. I have no friends my spouse and child are tired of me. I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing. I have just been sitting here in front of my work computer waiting I am unsure for what. I am not going to be called in I worry daily I am going to be fired because no one likes me on my team. I do not enjoy anything. I feel like I am just being shuffled from day to day with no meaning to my life. My life will never matter... I will never matter... how can things get better when I am the issue? I have 48 hours to ponder these thoughts before work. Idk why I even take days off all I have time to do is think. Days Off,Depression

7624,I have been overposting today for some reason. In a manic mood i supposed or whatever. I have been dealing with a lot lately and even though its been about 34 years since I have relapsed I am feeling very weak today and i think i may break. Like nothing i do seems to give me relief unless its gobbling down a pill or two or just drugs in general. I hate it. I want some kind of change and it hurts knowing that will not happen. I want to be happy not just for the day. But actually FEEL it day after day. Trigger warning,Depression
7761,21M. So. I have been feeling depressed very anxious and very low the past while. I grew up in a abusive household until I was 18 I moved in with my sister for 3 years and that turned toxic and it did not work out she was angry hatred thinks she still hates me I moved into student accommodation yesterday and I am still overwhelmed and depressed. I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line but I have dark feelings I feel hopeless alot pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation. I am still very low. But if anyone else is feeling low or suicidal. If this quiet socially anxious weirdo like me can do it anyone of you can I rung a support group,Depression
7026,I have just been sitting on my couch and I am just feeling lost about what to do about my dog because he was ran over. Like when I think about him i start crying to the point I cannot even breathe right and i miss him so much I do not want to do anything after he died ion rlly have much people to talk to about this and I talked to a friend and I feel better about it but I am still crying every single time I think about him or look at his equally sad sister. I have never been the type to be sad and gloomy but this broke my heart too much and I do not know how to handle it on my own. I am just confused as to how it happened why it happened and I do not even know how to feel about this. I am lost and confused,Depression
8605,So I am in a very bad place since... Idk how much time I do not have much money as I do not even work anymore but I really needed help and wanted to get help so I payed for a private psychologist ! it is been 10 sessions now and they sended an email to my psychiatrist that I have got from the public system after trying to die saying that they transfert my case to her... It took 10 sessions and 1500 from me for that and all that time that I thought I was getting help wasted... This money was precious money give me a lot of anxiety ! And it is all wasted I needed help assap so I payed for a private psychologist but after 10 sessions they decide to abandon and give me back to the public system that take too long and it was the reason I payed them in the first place !,Depression
7595,I am too fucking depressed to function rn holy shit and i have a whole ass shift i need to get through my chest feels Hollow currently in da panera bathroom sobbing,Depression
7017,So i do not take it for BP i take it for PTSD OCD and migraines and so far it aplears to be lifting me out of the depression that comes as a symptom of those conditions. Instead of wanting to just lay in my bed all day and shut myself away I am actually wanting to do stuff and lay with my cats in the living room and interact. I have like 1 to 2 tiny depressive mood drops on it each day but they last literaly like 5 min and then it brings me back up Lamictal is pulling me out of this,Depression
7778,The memories I suppressed for so long suddenly triggered today. I remembered how I used to feel like I was trapped in my own world and how i was suicidal in junior school at around age 10. I remember how my mum used to go into rage at mistakes i would make or me being annoying. I remembered how mum would tell me to put my arm out for her to hit me and if i pulled my arm back in fear she would threaten to hit me even harder. I was really fucked up back then. Every other night Id think about running away never having to face anyone who would hurt me or berate me or make fun of me like my classmates and teachers at school would or like my mum would at home. I think today was the day my old self that i had abandoned to heal finally came back to haunt me. Just needed to write this down. I just needed to write this down,Depression
7947,it is photography. People would always tell me it was my calling. I have have captured a lot of moments for families. I have made good money too. Its helped me as a sahm my fiance works but the side money always helps I have been pretty proud of myself and my work that I have done over the 4 years of being a photographer. Here lately it is just not been bringing me joy. My last two sessions I was suppose to have have been canceling last minute after me spending money on props that they wanted. People taking advantage of my work. Being mean about things. And I am lacking confident in my work for some reason. I am not really good at anything else and that is the part that stresses me out about losing interest in it. I mean I am literally not good at ANYTHING. I have tried many hobbies it is just hard for me to be good. it is making me sad though I want to continue but I just do not feel like doing anything. I am lacking in a lot of things. I just feel like sleeping all the time. I am losing my passion in my favorite hobby.,Depression
8299,Bitch why the fuck did you just tell me to cheer up? do not fucking act like you know what I go through everyday to muster up the courage to just EXIST through the day.. I have bottled up my emotions for all my life you did not do shit when i was getting bullied in school you yelled at me when that bitch of a teacher was issuing those ALREADY DISPROVED WARNINGS. God damn it ITS EVEN MORE HORRIBLE WHEN YOU SAY 'I KNOW HOW YOU ACT' BITCH YOU do not KNOW SHIT ABOUT ME. YOU do not KNOW THAT I gt!FUCKING CUT MY THIGHS!lt GOD I FUCKING HATE THEM ALL YOU ACT LIKE MY BROTHER IS PERFECT AND FAVOR HIM OVER ME? MOTHERFUCKER JUST BECAUSE he is YOUR BOOT LICKING RIGHT WING EXTREMIST RACIST PERFECT BOY THAT GETS ALL THE FUCKING GOOD GRADES. FUCK IT FUCK IT ALL FUCK FUCK FUCK I CANNOT FUCKING STAND ANYTHING ANYMORE THIS IS LEGIT THE FIRST PUBLIC FUCKING RANT I have EVER DID AFTER 14 FUCKING YEARS OH GOD FUCKING DAMN IT. YOU do not KNOW ME AT ALL. bahaha motherfucker Vent,Depression
8456,so I would just like to ask a favour of some people. I want to ask my Mum if I can go and see a therapist so can somebody please just tell me some things that I could say to try and persuade my Mum to let me see a therapist at my local doctors? I was thinking of some of the good times of my childhood where I was not screaming and crying internally. Where I was laughing with joy instead of my own pain. Where I was not self harming myself. They were good times... Hey,Depression
9039,I do not know how can we overcome this parasite that is called depression and anxiety! Its killing us. I am so fucking tired of being like this. I want to live happily enjoy life and make something with it.I am tired of thinking that its over and then all of a sudden it hits back even stronger.I am tired of being alone yes tired of being alone with no one that cares about me. Tired of being alone with my thoughts that will not stop until i kill my self.I am just tired. I think I am done with all of this shit.,Depression
8112,I really hate what we all deal with. Everyone I tried to call did not pick up. The ones that did had the Can I call you tomorrow talk. I do not want to deal with this anymore. And of course I am being strong to not hurt anyone. It just always sucks knowing the only person that you can depend on is yourself. I just needed to rant. I hope all of you get through your problems and live a great happy life. What kills me,Depression
8570,I am grateful for everything I have in life I genuinely believe I am blessed. Yet I feel empty and sad all the time. I never used to be like this until 2017. Its been like that for years now and it just will not go away. I had a expectation of how my adult life would turn out but I am still not satisfied. I was told twenties would be your most fun for me its the most depressing at most times. When I do enjoy life in the moment it kind of gets ruined by the thought knowing it will not last forever. I am really grateful for my so hes very supportive and understanding yet I still feel constant sadness.. I am not suicidal but I always feel empty and nothing. I hate this feeling and it makes me cry at some nights whereas other nights I cannot cry at all. Anyways.. I just want rant on here. Its my first time posting on this app. I have everything I want but I am still constantly depressed.,Depression
7600,I 17M have been diagnosed with Aspergers although my experiences are better described as high functioning autism although I do not function at all lol a semiofficial type of Autism. Luckily my autism was recognised very early in my life when I was about 34 years old. I was diagnosed with PDDNOS later with Aspergers. Because of my amazing parents who fought very hard for me to get the help I needed I got special training in primary school. I not only learned how to communicate with other people but also to control my explosions when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded screaming swearing slamming with doors. I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semifunctional and make friends. However this training had an unintended consequence I was convinced that the only way to be accepted in society was to isolate myself when it all got too much for me. This does not always work out and afterwards I feel really guilty especially if it happens around people I love because I see it leaves an impact on them. It also does not really help that I am constantly irritated because of the pandemic lack of sleep and maybe depression?I feel so guilty for being such an asshole my friends and family do not deserve it it is also the reason I feel like I do not deserve their love. Does anyone have similar experiences andor advice how to convince myself I am worthy of love? I would really love to hear your thoughts I feel like I do not deserve love,Depression
8791,Is it really depression if you not on the level of suicide? Grey state,Depression
9142,How shitty and lazy and useless I am made to feel for expressing the desire to spend the bulk of my day at home with people I like doing things I want to do instead of spending most of my days struggling to stay awake working a job I hate that I do not want or need and that no one actually cares about just to keep funding and supporting this pointless consumeristic lifestyle. How did we all agree to this and say it was ok to live 50 years like this? I look around and feel so isolated and alone that I view the world like this and its like the viel is lifted and I just cannot see it any other way now once you see the underlying truth to it all. Modern society is the reason I am depressed and I am sure so many others without even realising it.,Depression
8487,I had a job interview today it went like shit. My anxiety kicked in and I did not make the best impression. I have not worked in months I have no money but my savings that will not last until another 2 months. I live at home with my aunt and uncle because my mother is an alcoholic and emotionally abusive. I finished my nursing pre requisites finally after failing 2x. I will soon apply to a online one because its easy and I cannot get into any other. Sometimes I forget to eat sometimes I sleep all day. I deal with my depression daily staying in a relationship that is barley hanging by a thread. I have no friends. I am alone I have hit rock bottom. I do not see any purpose for me although I keep trying I never have any good outcomes. I stay in the same place same mental state. Some days it gets better and some days its miserable. I just turned 24. I have no idea what I am doing. 24F,Depression
7550,I have just last week started a new job after being signed off sick for 2 years. Its been really hard so far i had a panic attack on the drive in last week and this week i just feel unwell mentally a lot of the time.I really do not want to quit because i feel if i do that is it for me I have tried and failed too many times.But i keep feeling like i want to hurt myself so i do not have to go in not like to kill myself. But stuff like crashing my car punching a wall and breaking a bone or just something so i have an excuse. I have avoided it so far but there is just such a loud voice in my head telling me i should and that i should just give up on a job or anything in life. I have spoke to my doctor and therapist and its not been that helpful. I just do not know what to do really. Wanting to hurt myself to avoid work,Depression
7998,I am shaking and only have bad thoughts on my mind. I am married and my wife and I had kind of a fight tonight it was not really big or anything but I am still overthinking about it. Lately I have been thinking a lot that she would be way better with anyone else and that I do not do nothing good for her.I am a man that is always mad and that cannot be relaxed and does not like surprises. I cannot be a go happy about life person and she does not need this kind of person around her. She is this kind heart and I am just this dark void.Just thinking about ways of finishing my life right now is relaxing and that scares me a lot. Help me please,Depression
7830,I am suffering from depression and have been taking professional help as well. I have a few really bad days where I feel like though I want to get my work done I am unable to as I have no motivation and I just want to lie down or sleep. This makes me question myself is it really depression who is making my task impossible or am I using depression just as an excuse to avoid work. I am confused anxious and frustrated with myself all the time but since I am on meds I am able to have a little control over my emotions.I think I had Depression since my teenage years but it was left undiagnosed. I have read so much on how to deal with depression and tried different approaches but nothing seem to work. Which reinforces my doubt that maybe I am faking depression as I can use it as an excuse as I am not making progress in getting out of it and maybe I like to stay in depression so I do not have to do any work. But at the same time I never tell anyone at work that I am depressed so maybe I am not faking after all. Everything is so confusing. Whatever this is I do not think Ill ever be able to get out of this phase. I do not want to stay depressed but I cannot get myself out of it,Depression
7264,I am so upset I am circumcised. I am upset I never got the choice. I am upset I had to get a cosmetic complication fixed at 13 which was because the first circumcision as a baby was not done right so I could clean properly and the trauma that caused to get it fixed.I should have been left natural. I am upset that I am missing sensation and pleasure from sex that uncircumcised guys get to feel. At least I should be grateful I still can have sex.But I am just so upset that my body was carved into before I could consent and have permanently altered genitals that I wish were left alone.And I have nowhere to go because people mock me that I am upset about it. I am even going to get people mocking me here I know it but where else do I go?I wish I was born in a country other than America. That way I would still have my bodily autonomy intact and not violated.Fuck humanity for this shit. I am depressed and nobody cares.,Depression
7611,Last week I tested positive for covid for the first time.Ever since then my whole family is now positive. I do not even know how I got it or if I am the one who infected them but I just do not care at this point.I was doing so well. I was spending time with my friends and family outdoors with masks when needed. I had a workout routine and was feeling so confident in myself. I was going to therapy every week. Practicing self care. Exploring my spirituality.Then this happens. I am in constant pain no energy my lungs burn when I breathe. I cannot sleep. I cannot do weightlifting and my body dysmorphia is back full force. I cannot be around my loved ones. I cannot go to therapy. I cannot read or draw or focus on my hobbies because of the disorientation. I cried more this week than I have in months. I do not want to eat or move or exist. I feel immeasurable guilt for possibly bringing this home.Why is it every time I am doing better life gives me a big old middle finger up the ass? Am I destined to be miserable? I wish I could just die. Depression and Covid19,Depression
7130,I have been under a strict lockdown in my country for a good 3 months now and in that time I have done absolutely nothing but rot and waste time on my phone. my days are starting to blur into each other and i could not even tell you what i did yesterday or the day before that. i have all these depressive thoughts and I am rendered helpless by them. i want to feel like i have a purpose i guess that will happens when my next year of uni starts in sept but that cannot be the only thing to give me purpose. how do i find the motivation to do anything productive to give my life meaning let alone get out of bed? i feel like the life I am living now is not worth living,Depression
8181,I feel so much weight its like I can barely even breathe. I am not happy. I do not think Ill ever be happy. Not if I get into my dream college. Not if I land an amazing job. Nothing. I have a mom and dad and siblings. I have an at least mediocre SAT score and a high GPA. I have a job. I should be happy. But I am not. I am never happy. Everything sucks. I am an incredibly lucky person I could be so much worse off but everything just feels bitter. I work 8 hours and I come home and I am tired and I feel incomplete and exhausted and empty and then I think about how I have to write application essays and I cry. I just cry. I do not know what to do. Is any of this even worth it? Why am I even here. Rising senior,Depression
8452,I always thought I was a strong person. For many months now I have been feeling weak and just miserable. I feel pathetic and meaningless. I have been down on myself and everything is just extremely underwhelming. Most days I do not leave my bed. I have been sick and do not really eat much anymore. I drink so much water I feel like a damn plant So that is a plus. But the mental abuse I deal with along with everyone and everything letting me down is just a huge issue. I used to look forward to waking up and going about my day. And now I look forward to maybe one or two things in my life. I am stuck in a downward spiral and I do not see myself getting out of it anytime soon. I used to be such an incredibly happy person. Always tried to look on the brighter side of things. Now? Ha. I feel like I do not belong. I cannot take this anymore. I thought I was strong.,Depression
7996,I feel like I cannot open up to anybody anymore after how I have been treated after telling people my feelings therapy has not helped me unfortunately. Whenever I open up to someone they look at me like I am some weirdo who belongs in a psych ward. My sister has graduated from college my brother enters his junior year in college and my best friend enters his senior year. Hes the only person left and for only another year. He does not have depression and cannot relate to how I feel I have told him a few times how life feels but not really told him anything in detail about the thoughts and feeling that go through my head everyday. He is honest which I appreciate and tells me that he just does not really understand if I say anything like that. I just have nobody to talk to and next year the one true friend I have left is gone. If I try to vent to somebody they get scared away no matter how close they are to me.,Depression
8037,I identify myself as introvert. Since I have been exposed to internet from year 2016 I have always found comfort in reading about Psychology. I am fascinated by MBTI Big 5 Models Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friendfamily I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self talking about things I want because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine. Losing the definition of myself,Depression
8138,I know that what I think can be kind of stupid to most of you because the fact that I am not good at math makes me feel kind of depressed I was like below average in middle school and the same thing even in high school the problem is that when it comes to very difficult equations and problems my brain just cannot handle all that shit.The thing is that in my country almost all universities have at least 1 math exam even humanistic ones let alone technical and scientific ones.So if you are bad at math like me you have almost no chance of ever getting a degree that will garantee you a decent job or even getting a degree in general...I see everyone my age studying things I could never understand and I kind of feel inferiormuch more stupid compared to them.I know this is a very unusual feeling but that is what I feel about myself being a lot because in the Education world Not being good at math really penalises you in the university world,Depression
9000,Hello fellow redditors!First of all stay strong and keep fighting I have been taking antidepressants escitaloprame during my episode of major depression for about 4 months. Now that I am doing better I am going off the meds. By now I do not take any of those. While the antidepressants originally gave me sleeping issues I am starting to notice something that others probably would not consider a problem I often wake up after 45 hours of sleep not even being tired. I have never had so little sleep without further impact the lowest amount I have had before when I was relaxed has been around 6 hours.I know that there is a little chance to have specific genes that allow low amount of sleep. However I wondered if my observations might be due to antidepressants changing the brain activity in the long run.Have any of you had similiar experience with sleeping quality after going off antidepressants?PS I suspect that I have had dysthymia through my whole life with some depression episodes inbetween so maybe my sleep quality increased because I am finally fine something that I wish for every single one of you! Sleep changes after taking antidepressants,Depression
8078,And what was your experience like during diagnosis? When and where did you all get diagnosed?,Depression
7327,I am 17 been on Effexor for about a year. I was suicidal before starting it and now I feel mostly fine. I am going off of it because I feel like it has affected my ability to maintain relationships both girlfriends I have had while I have been on it I feel like I have not been able to actually connect with them emotionally like I cannot fall in love with them. I have heard other people share similar stories. Also I am sexually active with my girlfriend and I cannot cum we have had sex probably like twice a week for the last 2 months and I have finished exactly 1 time. Its horrible. For a while I could not even get it up. But anyways that is why I am going off it. What should I do to try to prevent my depression from coming back once I am off it? I am currently in the process of weaning off of Effexor. I am at like half of my dose of 75 mg planning on cutting that to 0 in 2 weeks or so once I run out of pills. How do I make sure my depression does not come back after going off of antidepressants?,Depression
8918,2 days ago I was lying on my floor crying my eyes out wanting nothing more than to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger. Right now I am sitting here drinking a cup of coffee eating a donut with my dogs asleep by my side listening to some tunes not a care in the world. Why cannot every day be like this? What makes today different? I am having a good day.,Depression
7054,I needed to get this out because I have been bottling up everything for 3 years now.I have felt horrible for the last 3 years now. I am diagnosed with severe social anxiety Anger issues ADHD and autism.3 years ago I got sexually abused for 2 months. I have not ever told anyone about this and still think about it every day.The next year while on vacation I was mad and out of rage I hit a window. This cut into my artery and I almost bled out. I still get flashbacks from this and never fully recovered.Due to covid I failed all my classes because I did not have any motivation and was severely depressed. I just want for it to all be over.It feels like nothing in my life is going well. Every time I am happy because I am with friends I zone out and think about all of the things stated above. I just cannot deal with this anymoresidenote I am sorry if this is hard to read. English is not my first language and I am very bad at talking about how I feel .,Depression
8100,I am in a really dark place right now and I just need to know how I can prevent myself from doing anything to hurt myself. I feel like I am losing it. How to prevent hurting myself?,Depression
8103,I am so tired of depression. One of the worst feelings i have lately is knowing if i did not feel this way so often i would be so much better of a person. I notice how much it holds me back and i always just picture would i could do and what i would be capable of if i did not feel this way all the time. I have had a few years in my life where i actually did feel ok and my head felt clear. I just wish i had that back Just tired,Depression
8107,I keep myself as busy as possible knowing that when I am not busy my mental starts tanking. But even being as busy as I have ever been. Having achieved some of my life long goals at 24 years young. Yet the time I get to myself I just sit and heavly critique everything I have done and end up in badddd spot. Idk. Its exhausting. I hope at some point I am happy and content with my lifes work. Its hard to enjoy anything I have accomplished. By time I am approaching hitting one goal my brains already like what is next Almost like a sickness in me. I literally joke with my biz partner that I am just not well. Little does he know it are not a joke. Its hrd to talk to anyone about this type of stuff because I am just suppose to be happy idk . Hope everyone has a good night. Sorry for typos or w.e I try,Depression
7721,I am currently under three meds Lithium paroxetine and lamotrigine for a couple years now and fairly recently I have been having problems when articulating spoken words and speaking long sentences I talk and suddenly I get stuck mid sentence and need to wait a couple lseconds to keep talking as if my brain needed to catch up and I have been stuttering and mispronouncing words more often than it would be considered normal. Have you experienced something similar with antidepressantsmood. Regulators? This is becoming really annoying and it makes yet another reason to be fucking depressed. Thanks for your input in advance Issues derived from medication,Depression
7627,I was just on my bed feeling suicidal as usual and then I decided to try browse rnihilism. I know it sounds odd but hear me out. The realisation that nothing is going to matter kind of helped me a bit. The ability to separate myself from my feelings and thoughts. Nothing will matter in the end but that does not mean that you will never be able to feel validity in happiness. it is ok to just wander through life enjoying it until we die. I just got out of a suicidal spiral in 5 minutes and I am oddly proud of myself,Depression
7847,Does anyone else here feel the same where you think that if you were able to cut the memories out of your mind that you obsess over you would finally be in a place to get better? I constantly want to forget everything that I have been through. I believe that if I am able to forget Ill finally be happy.I black out every time I drink and I do whatever drugs I can put my hands on just in hopes of permanently altering the images that swim inside my head. At this point I would not be surprised and am indifferent towards whether I wake up. I just cannot stay sober with my thoughts and memories because they ruin me every time. I just want the numbness to consume me because living this way is my own personal hell. I close my eyes every night and I seefeel the family and friends I have lost my so is who have hurt me and the pain that I have continuously had while living in this volatile emotional state for too long. Praying for Amnesia,Depression
7273,I have had suicidal thought idk if that is a sign of sadness or depression ? Can someone help Am I depressed or just sad?,Depression
7972,I do not know how much longer I can keep going. The wasted effort the looping thoughts that no matter how hard I try to tell myself they are not real or that they do not mean anything about me keep tearing me down and effecting me. I am sick of this I am sick of being stuck in my head and not able to function correctly. I am over trying everything under the sun to try to be okay. I cannot keep this up I do not want to keep this up its painful and sad. No matter what I do nothing helps I just wish I could vanish from existence no pain from my family or friends just disappear like I was never born. Is there a way out?,Depression
7643,First off English are not my first language and this post could be a little longer.Writing this feels kind of surreal but I think i need to get it off my chest.I was diagnosed with depressive and social anxiety disorder like a year ago.Went to therapyMy gf and i broke up with like 2 months ago. I feel so empty now the first week after the breakup was not so bad just weird.But like right now I am pretty close to the edge.I am a failure got no motivation to doe anything.shower work out etc.It was a relationship of 15 years and I just feel like something was ripped out of me.All my happiness my motivation my will to live and everything else that made me happy is gone now.She already has a new one.I deleted all of her pics yesterday and it hurt me so much to think about the time with her.I tild myself yesterdayIf this doesbt get better in 2022 I am killing myselfI know it sounds harsh but if my life is not woth living because of the everlasting pain and discomfort inside my head.then why should i keep trying?I already was in a dark place before the relationship ended but this episode is by far the worst i have ever expierienced.Thanks for listening. I think this is the end,Depression
7934,I am not sure this friend has depression. Honestly he is going through a rough time as he dropped out of uni during the pandemic and decided to start a new programme in another city. But this process has been going on since a year ago.This friend is really dear to me and I would like to support him but we never really went deep or personal in conversations. I am afraid of coming off as pushy or hurting his pride I am a girl and he is a boy. Also there is pretty much no way of us seeing each other as we live in different cities. How can I support him or be there for him in a way that is not artificial and that does not make him uncomfortable? How do I help a depressed friend from distance?,Depression
8179,I am very ugly and think I have a boring and monotone personality. I am not funny or confidence and I have social anxiety. I know that dating people is out of my reach but I do wish there was a dating website for people who are not high class and beautiful I wish there was a dating site for low class people,Depression
7086,I am about to go out on my bike with a friend. I would rather stay in my room but i promised i will be there. I am about to finally go out today,Depression
7708,It has been 7 years since my brother died by suicide and honestly life has never been the same but not better. He killed himself using a gun owned by my father and left a suicide note written in japanese he selfstudied the language. We never saw the whole note since it was surrendered together with the gun to the police and my parents never wanted to read it. After his death they burned all of his things laptop books etc. and never talked about the reason of his death ever again. There was always a time once a year when my curiosity got the better of me I asked them if they could get a copy of it or if the police can translate it for us and it always ended with disastrous fights with me against my parents. I always feel like I will never have my peace of mind if I will not be able to read about the letter.In the end I always feel like the note could be some sort of closure for our family.Today I feel like I just want to follow my brothers footsteps. My parents became more emotionally absent. They always feel like they are right and their ideas must always be followed. I also just feel like a burden to this family. I do not even see myself alive after 5 years. I just want to die. My brother died by suicide,Depression
9132,From a young age I was always a lot smarter than the average kid I loved this till I was about 12. After that it was always the pressure that I am supposed to be the best. and past the age of 12 it is all my parents care about. They could not care less if I am happy as long as I get good grades that is all that matters now. Most people do not understand one bit. I wish I was not so smart. My dream is to become an artist and live in a little cottage. But that cannot happen. I am set up to become a biologist. that is what my grandpa did. I am too young to already know that I am just going to spend the rest of my life doing something I hate. ampx200BBeing smart also means that teachers do not care about my mental health. it is the extra work that kills me. I am practically still a kid. I cannot take all the work. it is all too much. I am not even working towards my goals in life I am working towards what I have to do. I hate it. I have no choice. I know for a fact that I have to be a scientist for my family not disown me. they have paid for my private schooling I cannot just not do what they want. ampx200BAll I want is to be happy but I cannot. I should enjoy school because I am smart but I do not.,Depression

8105,Hey you all.I am a 38 year old male married with an 8 year old and a 8 month old. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 20 years now. I was passively suicidal about 34 years ago but that feeling has since dropped of dramatically with proper medication therapy and leaving a life situation behind that I really struggled with.What I am really struggling with feeling alone and without people that care lately outside of my own four walls.Growing up I had a very close family on my mom's side. I have 2 brothers 4 aunt'suncle's and many cousins from those. We used to get together every Sunday and all major holidays.My mom passed away back in 2008 and nothing family had been the same since especially for me. My mom was amazing she was my biggest cheerleader my confidant and talked me off every ledge. After she died My dad moved about 14 hours away. One of my brothers is estranged because of an incredibly dumb situation that he completely cut me off since about 6 years ago. I have tried multiple times to mend that fence to no avail. I just get ignored. Since then two of my mom's siblings have also passed and one moved across the country. My other cousins have either stopped talking to me because of my brother situation or moved away or I am quite a bit younger so we never really got together much.I have also heard that quite a few of them think I am snobby because I am one of the only members of my family to graduate from college and I make great money. I NEVER shove that in anyone's face though and I do not want any of that to define me. The only two members of my family I have really even seen outside of weddings or funerals is my other brother and my dad. As previously mentioned my dad is not around and my other brother is my best friend and we are super close. About a month ago though he decided to up and move south with his family because he could no longer afford to live in MA. Obviously I support him and want what is best for HIS life but I was devastated.On the friends front I have never been great at having close friends. I had a really close friend growing up but over the years we have drifted apart. I have a decent group of college friends but none that I see or hang out with often except one and about 56 years ago he moved across the country to be with the love of his life. I am so incredibly happy for the guy but at the same time I felt such a huge loss. I am honestly not that great of a friend anyway. When I go through depressive episodes I tend to flake a lot.I do have a spiritual community but I am not particularly friendly with any of them. I am also much younger than about 90 of the congregation. Tldr I guess what is bothering me most is feelings of abandonment. I do not want to be close with people because everyone I have cared about has either left me cut me out of their lives or died. I am really struggling with relationships and the thing most depressing me right now is if I happened to die whether self inflicted or not who would even show up to my funeral? I do not feel like there is anyone out there that gives a flying shit what happens to me beyond my wife and my girls and that really sucks. I just want to feel important and cared for and I do not feel like I have any of that. I feel like my wake would be about 20 people and none of them would even give a shit about actually wanting to me there and that makes me sad. Feeling incredibly lonely lately,Depression
8479,I already posted this on other subreddit but I got not answer so here I go again First of all I want to say that I am a huge ignorant about depression and anxiety plus my mind feels foggy so I cannot think straight at the moment. I am a 27 year old female happily married for almost one year. I moved to the USA 3 years ago by myself and I have not seen my parents family old friends since. I also got to say that I have always been a melancholic type of person. I experienced lots of new emotions when I moved here with the cultural shock and having to properly learn English and find a new way to make friends has been hard. I was super social and extroverted back in my home country and here that has been slowly changing. I feel shy with a new group of people and I just rather be at home. Its been a few months since I started to feel way more stressed and anxious. I never felt anxious before until covid and all that shit started to happen. there is some days when I feel so sad and I just want to lay in bed and cry. The feeling comes and goes Id say it happens around 4 or 5 times a month. But this last week just got worse I really feel sad everyday I feel a hole on my chest and I sob and cry uncontrollably. I believe I do not have a reason to be sad I have honestly a great relationship with my husband hes super supportive and hes always there for me. I was never homesick until covid my dad got sick and I could not see him but hes all better and doing great I video call them every week. My husband and I are moving in a month and were both very excited about it. We both have good jobs.I have this terrible thoughts about everyone dying including myself. Is almost as if my own brain was trying to make me sad on purpose. I try to stop the thoughts and think of something positive but they always come back. I distract myself watching a movie but as soon as it ends I go back at crying. I have always been very self conscious and I am not very comfortable with my body but I never had issues with my husband before.Yesterday we tried to get intimate and while kissing I just started crying and could not stop until past 10 pm. I am literally crying while typing this. I do not know If I am depressed or I have an hormonal unbalance if its just anxiety build up. I am so tired of feeling this way and I cannot wait to be my normal self again. Any advice is appreciated. I am not sure I am I am depressed?,Depression
8320,I work construction I struggle to get up in the morning. I feel overwhelmed about everything and it does not seem worth it. I have a house and more vehicles than I need. I am stuck. I live in America.. land of the free.. I do not see that. Our system is bad I rage when I think about it and I always shut down when I get upset not to feel it. I feel that nothing will get better its just a never ending cycle to work to live. Its all we do and I do not see that as freedom. I want to give up and sleep for days and avoid everything but there is never rest. I feel like nothing is worth it,Depression
8874,So I tend to get depressive episodes on a fairly regular basis when I am at optimal mental health I get mild to severe dips like a week before my cycle that then go away within a few days but I have been having some longer than normal ones lately and I have been stuck in that sinking black hole for about two full weeks now. Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety I sometimes do not take jokes very well especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or in rare cases until I start crying. A lot of times their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of. and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love as well as mental heath topics when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way. This is easily the worst I have been mental healthwise in like a year and I am starting to struggle a little and letting the bad thoughts linger. Sorry for the long post. there is a lot going on in my head and my life that I need to parse through I guess. Been A Little Rough Lately,Depression
7116,I do not remember what a hug feels like anymore. Everyone I know would benefit from it and you would just be doing them a service. Please just do everyone in my life a favour and take out the trash. I cannot keep going anymore it hurts so much and I cannot even let myself cry about because I know I will break because I know the only people who will hear it are the people who will tell me to be quiet and stop bothering them. Please just kill me,Depression
8767,I am 22 female weigh 43kg dealing with depression I am hourglass shape I am very short I have c 14 breast but feel like I am fat i was very sick last year I was eating 900 calories because eating over makes me feel sick fast food like McDonalds makes me nauseous I got made fun of when I used to be in school about my breast by this girl who thinks there to big things are slowly getting better I do not have a problem with men but I still feel like shit what is wrong with my body,Depression
8846,I do not really have a job I doordash full time and now that my car is out of commission ATM it looks like my plans are yet again being fucked by life. Every time iv tried to move forward life's thrown me a curveball and kept me in my current position.I swear to God it feels like I am being forced to stay here by some unknown presence. This may sound psychotic but iv had delusions that I am a CIA social experiment and they cannot let me move otherwise the experiment will fail.Realistically I know it is just cruel coincidence but fuck me there is been too many coincidences. 19 little money finally have an opportunity to move and my cars rim bends and my tire gets fucked.,Depression
8134,I met my exwife when I was 19 and after 3 months she insisted that we get married. Obvious red flag and I knew that then but I had extremely low self esteem and thought it was a miracle that anybody would be interested in me in the first place.I thought that if I said no Id lose her and be alone the rest of my life so I agreed. Thus began one of the worst chapters of my life.To keep a long story shortish naive sheltered me ended up introduced to hard drugs got my shit kicked in by a meth head trying to rape my wife watched her nearly die due to OD wandered several states homeless and got constantly reminded that she did not love me but just married me to get away from her insane mom.She ended up pregnant and a few months after our daughter was born she told me she did not need anything from me anymore and filed for divorce. She wanted me to just agree to disappearing from my daughters life but there was no way in hell I could do that especially since my own father disappeared shortly after I was born so I fought it.Me disobeying her made her furious so during the divorcecustody hearings she accused me of everything under the sun saying I was physicallysexually abusive a pedophile that I trafficked her etc. etc. She had nothing to support any of those claims because they were bullshit but I was investigated by DHS and law enforcement three times because she just kept making worse and worse accusations.In the end she got full custody because the judge said every child should be with the mother not the father were in a deep red state and I got standard visitation. The next several years were their own nightmare that I will not get into because this is getting too long but she constantly tried to poison my daughter against me and my family and was generally extremely toxic. Luckily my daughter is smart and saw through the lies.Her mom remarried had another daughter then around the time my daughter was 8 she decided she did not want to be a mom anymore and just left to whoknowswhere.My daughter moved in with me and we heard almost nothing about her mom until my daughter was 12 when we found out she hung herself.I have never cried so hard in my life not for myself but for empathy for my daughter. I have to watch as my daughter now has occasional panic attacks I have to listen as she occasionally weeps in the other room and I have to feel guilty as a small hateful part of me is glad that her mom is gone and cannot spread anymore poison. I try to suppress that part and I feel like a terrible person because of it.tldr Married a deeply troubled person who killed herself and I have mixed feelings about it. My exwife mother of my daughter killed herself.,Depression

7074,I am 31. I was living my perfect life for 7 years. Prior to that I was depressed and felt lost in life. I was engaged to my soulmate the one person I felt Id spent my life searching for and could not live without. We had a beautiful 4 bed house in need of work which I was working hard on renovating. I was also at university getting a bachelor of science in CGI having realised finally what I wanted to do with my life. I was a whirlwind of happiness and productivity. We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together get married finally and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting longterm happiness it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out argumentative and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been 3 months and I still dream about her every night. I lay in bed drifting in and out of consciousness until the afternoon unable to face another day of rotting away in my parents dark spare room. The amount of daylight I waste in bed means I have to spend more of the worst loneliest hours of the late night unable to sleep.I do not want to die I just want my old life back but that is never going to happen. My existence is utterly intolerable. My life crumbled in a week I lost everything I am now a lost soul,Depression
8572,I hate that I cannot talk about my problems to my friends or family. Most of them say they want to help but when things start to get too real for them they no longer want to listen. Once you mention suicide they no longer want to be there. The worst part is that whenif I actually did go through with it they would be the first people to say if only he reached out for help. I just want someone to try to understand what I feel and where I come from. I just want my family to understand or at least attempt to understand. Does anyone else feel this way? Are your families comfortable with listening to you? I hate that I cannot talk about it,Depression
8203,knowing how long I have had to live with people feeling that I just do not have an attractive face. Trying to discuss this with therapist made it at times damn near impossible to talk. I am a 23 year old guy discussing looks and attractiveness in therapy would always nearly bring me to tears,Depression
8654,I am 21 and I have started feeling that I have not done anything in my life. I wanted to party with my friends do the late night road trips and stuff with them but my parents are too possessive about me and hardly allow me to socialize with my friends. And now I am 21 thinking that only 1 more year left to end my collegeuniversity days and then I will be doing some 95 job somewhere.. Everyone else will be busy in their life.. And when I am free to take my own decisions I will be burdened with responsibilities already.. What should I do?,Depression
7525,I am tired of constantly getting in the way and I do not know what to do anymore. I feel like I get pushed around but I am too scared to try and stand up for myself. If I could just disappear for a bit people could get on with their lives without me interrupting them. I am tired of constantly getting in the way.,Depression
7159,I am so fucking suicidal but cannot bring myself to do it i pull the knife to my throat but cannot convince myself everybody in my family loves me but myself. Why do i hate myself there is no reason am i just being a spoiledugly brat? I feel like every part of me is too tired for anything but i try if i could i would sleep my life away. I try to convince myself to tell my family and reach out but younger me has little devil ears and clicked the button of Life Ruiner. Is their anyway to kill myself but painless and quick? Kill me,Depression
8147,Just had one of the most fun weekend in years. Went out hung out with friends ended up separating from my friends and hung out with 3 strangers and explored the town for hours. Legitimately one of the most fun nights I have had in a longggg time. Literally was hanging out with these people and talking like we have been friends forever. Then it just ended. We went our separate ways and life went back to normal on Monday when I had work. I cannot stop thinking about how fun this weekend was but its also making me insanely depressed and sad. WHY? Like I just experienced something that brought me so much goddamn joy and happiness and its like my brain thinks I did not deserve it or that Ill never experience it again. Idk if this even make sense but fuck. It feels like I lost friends that I have known for a lifetime. What is wrong with me ? I knew them for 4 hours hahah Why do I get SO sad after fun days? Is this normal?,Depression
8121,I hate existing. Today I woke up thinking I can make it work but again I cannot. My family hates me I hate myself I can never be better. Just when I thought I can be better the universe just keep pushing me into the dark,Depression
8359,I feel trapped. I keep writing and deleting. I do not want to hear what I am thinking. All in my head is negatife thoughts for so long. I tried to change it so much. I do not want to go to psychologist because when I was going through OCD i did and my family threated me in the worst way possible. I wish I could get antidepressants Even though I do not know if its the answer Mixed emotions,Depression
8978,Every second of the day I am on the edge of having a panic attack I had my first last year in November it felt like I was going crazy and words did not make sense I felt this fear over come my body I felt as if I was seeing the world through a phone and I did not feel present if that makes sense. I suffer with really bad social anxiety but during my panic attack I wanted to run up to random people and ask this if everything was going to be okay and to make sure I was fine. I got lightheaded because of the terror in my body and my hands and legs were going cold and numb. I seriously wanted to die during it all it lasted about 20 minutes and then calmed down a bit to where I could at least keep myself fighting to want to live. I have not had a full blown panic attack like that again but ever since I know the feeling I have this fear of having it again and will get random waves of that anxiety I had before I had my panic attack which just makes me freak out more. I do not want to self diagnose so I am just going to say I have this intrusive thoughts that I am becoming schizophrenic 247 so the most random things will trigger me that never did before and I obsess over it 1000 times after that questioning why it did and come to the conclusion I am losing it. If I hear a song on the radio and the voice is kind of weird or the beat is somewhat scary I imagine scary things and my brain will start glitching out but I think it is because of the fear in my head and I am just fabricating my fears. How do I stop this. When does it stop,Depression
7143,I think I have been depressed for a little over 5 years now and as I am returning to the world due to COVID winding down in my area I am starting to see how the isolation and negative thoughts are affecting me physically and emotionally. I finally went to get my drivers license a little less than a month ago and on the way to take the road test I just started feeling awful like I the weight of the world was bearing down on me slowly crushing me. I felt my limbs go numb and the urge to vomit was creeping in along with tears beginning to cloud the edges of my vision. I have never felt as out of control of my body as I did that day it was definitely a first for me. I have never had a good outlet for all the feelings I suppress and its awful to feel that you cannot trust those closest to you I love my parents deeply but I cannot trust them with the truth and it would only make them worry. Oddly I have found that self flagellation helps calm my mind I get no pleasure from it and I do not beat myself bloody but pain helps me focus and take my mind away from darker trains of thought. I am going to be applying for a job in a few days and that is what is currently the main source of stress in my life right now. If I land the job it will mean moving away to pursue the work but on the other hand I think getting away from my family and having my own space will ultimately do me some good in the long haul. I cannot fail afford to fail here I need to keep moving forward.I do not really want to die I just want the pain to stop. Crossroads,Depression
7382,I know you are not supposed to drink depressed amp alone but it always makes me feel better. Everyone who tells me not to says it is because it will make you feel worse but it always numbs me and makes me feel better. I have not drank alone in a while but I did tonight quite a bit and I am a bit concerned I will go on a binge again.I do not drink during work but I had a week where I constantly drank after work and it started with one night like this. Not sure what to do... any replacements for alcohol? Drinking to cope,Depression
7542,Paradoxically all I want is to do is to not have to do stuff. Like not having to work which is honestly one of the biggest reasons I hate living. Any job whatsoever is hell every single job.But you are forced to work 8 hours a day or even more to survive for bills and food and such. Torture especially if you are doing it just to not be homeless.I just have NO reasons to live. Only reason I did not off myself is because I do not want to make my parents suffer or my cat. And I will not ever off myself do not have it in me to do that. I guess many years of anhedonia since a relatively young age does this to you. I wish I could just lie in bed all day at least but no I have to endure torture for so many hours a day by having to work. Every second is torture. At this point I am not even sure I am depressed anymore. I just do not likewant anything in life do not have any reasons to live. do not want kids do not want a relationship do not want friends do not want money do not want success do not want anything really. No reasons to live.,Depression
7429,i feel like i have no reason to live. my brother is being an asshole so i started crying and then he continued to play the play station like he did not even care. My existence does not matter to anyone. and that is just how it is. if someone could help that would be appreciated Kill Me,Depression
8920,Hi I am new to Reddit and this is my first vent post so this might be a little long and all over the place. I just wanted to rant about some things I have been feeling lately. Any nice comments would be appreciated. I am a sophomore in college and a student athlete my sport being swimming. My first year was the worst I have ever performed and I am scared that Ill never amount to anything. I feel like I am steadily declining and losing the only thing I have been successful at my whole life. I used to be really great at what I do and really respected and now I am fucking pathetic. All of my efforts each day do not do shit and I have not improved or made any progress at all. If I cannot do well at something I literally dedicate my entire life to all that tells me is that Ill never be good at anything and Ill just be mediocre my whole life. Nothing special. A worthless pathetic loser. I just want to die but I know Id never actually have the guts to kill myself. It feels like suicidal thoughts are always in my head though. I have tried hurting myself recently but I was too afraid to go any further. I am so obsessed with my weight and I cannot look in the mirror without wanting to rip myself apart. I fucking hate myself. So much shit is going on in my head that I cannot even begin to try and deal with it so I spend most of my time laying in bed consuming 5 different forms of media at the same time so I do not have any time to think. there is so much going on and so much I feel is wrong with me but I do not really know what it is. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I feel like the shit I deal with is more than that. But my whole life my parents would always tell me that I overreact about everything and that I just needed to toughen up and be a big girl. I cannot even trust myself and my own feelings anymore. I do not understand anything and I am so tired of my mind being like this. I do not know what to do or how to help myself anymore. I just want to give up. I feel stuck in this deep hole and have no hope of getting myself out of it.,Depression
7740,My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 34 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopramantidepressant ssri and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever because i thought i was feel better and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious agitated panicky and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep. I think it was the weed combo that did that sorry for wasting your time if you r reading this ik its a lot of writing. here is my story 15M,Depression
6973,Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery like its my punishment or something. And in a related way I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable because if I lose only them and not my selfhating mindset Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery Ill still get new problems which could be just as bad or worse and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why,Depression
8772,I worked up enough courage to tell my wife today that I am depressed. She responded saying that she dosent have time for this and hasent replied to me. The response I feared finally came.,Depression
8242,Seriously I have been trying to find something that fills me with that spark again that I barely even remember anymore.Work is boring and I hate every second of it.I have seen the nature around me a million times it just does not do it for me.Food sex drugs and rollercoasters are all temporary and you fall back to the same cycle of misery in no time.Human interactions are draining and currently the worst thing about life for me because everyone take a everything too personally and tries to make you feel guilty about yourself.The world is going fucking downhill and there is no great future ahead of us.I tried to look around me for anything that gives me joy and the only thing that I find is my cat. Give me a reason to be happy about something.,Depression
7741,Hi I always wanted to talk here but never did. I have depression since age of 10 I am 18 years old. I lost a huge amount of my memory power like if I have dementia it is the most annoying shit. Because of that my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot in school for instance people know I have autism asperger and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me one big reason why I hate human beings. I also lost all the human fear of death like in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me that is what sh with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it. And he just ran away and hid from me everyday in school. So anyway that is it I will go listen to Soundgarden Joy Division and Misfits all day like always. Bye Fear of the Deathark.,Depression
7337,I have been obsessed with the same girl for almost 20 years and everyone else I like I instantly fall in love with. I cannot act on anything because I think I am worthless.Not like any of these feelings are real they are just my brain trying to extract love and positive feelings from someplace since I do not get it from anywhere else. I wish I was dead I am too full of love,Depression
7544,Irritability is one of my biggest things and I often find myself getting irrationally angry at my loved ones when they pester me. Sometimes I wish I could cocoon myself away from them inside an impenetrable fortress so that Id finally be alone and happy. But I also just generally wish that I could be free from the world and not have to deal with responsibilities people life etc. I wish I could make the world go away. Wanting the world to go away,Depression
8696,In the end I know what is best for myself right?Ill finally be able to be happy. Can there just be a day where I do not wake up,Depression
7133,I am someone who has older parents than most people my Dad is 44 years older than me and my Mum is 40 years older than me I am in my mid teens.They have had heated arguments years ago and they used to happen very occasionally. If they were a few years younger they would have got divorced I am sure of it. There is no doubt in my mind that they do not love each other or at least not anymore. Over really simple things they just yell at each other constantly and recently its happened for four days straight very long arguments.I absolutely hate it. It makes me cry away to my room and shut the door tight and put on headphones so I do not hear a word of what they are saying. I want nothing more than for them to stay together and not spilt up for the sake of the family. If they divorce I do not know what side to take but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other but clearly I was far from right. I recently have felt the urge to step in myself and just tell them both to shut up and get along and have even considered buying flowers for my Mum and telling her it was my Dad so that they would hopefully calm down or something. It sucks it really does. I just want them to like each other again. Hearing your parents fights everyday is just the worst.,Depression
7047,I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a longlasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off I go back to being aloof insecure and selfcentered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident fun version of me is kind of a parttime deal.On top of it all I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray I have bad eye bags and dark circles and although I have tried I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow just a week later the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop selflove and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry two semesters left but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

7136,Losing my shit over not knowing where to put some cuts in a way that no one will see it or that i will not have to worry about not being able to wear an outfit because it might bleed through it I am freaking out i need release,Depression
7332,I have never been on medication before. I finally talked to my doctor and told him I needed help. I start tomorrow. I know it will not be perfect right away and Ill have to make adjustments to dosage and maybe type. I just hope its a step in the right direction. I start antidepressantsanti anxiety meds tomorrow,Depression
8202,I do not want to hear oh you matter just keep going or it gets better. I have made my attempt at getting better time and time again I eventually get beat back down. I have done therapy I am on meds I am so sick of depending on a pill just to feel normal. it is fucking sickening to think about. Any time I break down to a friend they always say just how much I have going for me because I am so smart or some other meaningless bullshit. I do not have a bad life I am almost done with college studying physics I have both of my parents they care for me. Of course there is all of the family bullshit that goes on behind the scenes but everyone has that so who cares. My gf loves me endlessly but I feel like an empty she will why fucking bother. I hate everything about our existence probably just being dramatic but it frustrates me. Everyone is pitted against each other we are destroying the planet and no one cares politics is a nightmare. I do not want to be a part of this world. I am so sick of waking up every day to just go to work and then get baked as fuck. do not tell me to get a hobby I have done that I always just lose interest. I have tried gardening aquariums woodworking hiking biking running gaming every last thing just eventually fades to grey just like everything else. I do not want anyones help or advice I just want to voice this somewhere that it does not matter and can just get lost in the 1s and 0s. If I could have anything on the planet right now I would give anything to just no longer exist. My demons that I will never truly escape aside from the brief commercial breaks where maybe my meds work or I am having a good day. I just wanted to be wiped from the planet I cannot stand this shit anymore.Goodnight. I am so exhausted being alive.,Depression
7193,It will be my first time trying Wellbutrin. Are there any side effects? How does it affect sex drive? I am a female. Has anyone tried Wellbutrin?,Depression
7188,i do not know if its depression last year i used to love studying and did it for around 8 hours on top of school because i just enjoyed it . maybe its burnout but now i cannot even study for 10 minutes without feeling like its not worth it. this is the course i wanted to study my entire life. i wake up in the morning full of anxiety and have to calm myself down because the thought of university is too much. maybe its the fact that i was anticipating life to be good at this stage and for me to be happy that now that I am not it is heartbreaking. i will never drop out of school but i have considered suicide because staying does not seem worth it. I have a bf and a loving family but seeing them no longer brings me joy either. but i want to know if i should visit a doctor and get on medication or should i just wait it out for a few more months. not worth it,Depression
7513,nothing matterswhy bothereverything justgets harderthere's nothing left for mei should just diethere's nothing I will getout of staying alivethe world is a messcan you even expectme to be happywhen it is like thisi've been tryingbut I am still like thisi'm still dyingno denyingI do not really want to kill myselfBut I do not want to live with myselfWhat do I do?

8803,My little sister came into my room and I got made and went outside to the back because my mom told her to look for something and I do not like when she is in my room it frustrated me since I was annoyed Then when I went to the backyard and when I came back I noticed my phone missing.I know they knew the password since I keep all mine the same to remember easier.I told my mom to tell my little sister to give me my phone.Then my little sister shows up and I tell her I know she has my phone telling her to give it back.She started talking shit and normally I would ignore it because I am depressed.But I started talking and you could hear my voice almost sounded like I wanted to cry but kept trying to defend myself.My sister used to not be that way.She used to be nice and everyone liked her but now she is acting like she is better than everyone.Sometimes she is psychotic the way her tone of voice gets.My dad died so maybe that is why or sleep.I everyone since I want to be left alone but do not like looking at her since she is rude for anything.I do not know why I deserve more pain when I have been down for a long time already Its hard being happy when you are already down and people do not acknowledge your mental state so it makes it worse. Its embarrassing I got hurt by my little sister,Depression
7899,Maybe the song Achilles come down has it right.it is just so weird how people treat relationships how easily they discart it for something better how much being with someone gives you hope until it is just another reason to commit suicide not like a broken heart will necessarily make you jump but for a time in my life I even tried pursuing a relationship because I know it never works with me because I knew they made me want to kill myself but it was never enough and it seemed that no amount of birthday wishes would bring me closer to not existing anymore.But you know despite all the bullshit the little broken pieces of me i left scattered behind and just giving up on everything I still manage to stumble into someone I love by accident and this one is truly special and different in a way none of my relationships was before. But it just makes me wonder how ironic it would be if it just broke appart and left me so much less than the little I am now if hope and love just serve as entries when the main dish is always misery and hopeless and I wonder if everything falls appart again will I just be someone looking for hope like an addict looks for his next fix or will I be lucky enough to never wake up again. Love is such a scary thing,Depression
8489,Hello. After having a quite long psychotic episode I have been struggling with really bad depression. Even now when my meds do not naturally repress the happy processes in my brain I still struggle a lot. Using one mental health app to read helpful things and doing household tasks here and there is something that helps me feel better. If you had a similar experience can you share what things help the situation for you? What eases postpsychotic depression for you?,Depression
8554,Its getting crippling. I literally do not do shit now and am not motivated to do anything. cannot even bring myself to enjoy a game bc it feels like I would be wasting my time even tho Id be wasting my time anyways doing nothing. All I do is work and not talk to my family and I do not have any friends. Everything just seems so fucking boring to me now.,Depression
7168,I feel so guilty anytime I open up to close friends about depression. it is gotten to a point where I want to talk to them not even strictly mental health stuff but just in general and I feel like a burden and that they have had enough of me. They say they care about me and I have to believe it because I do not know what id do if I did not. I just needed a place to voice my thoughts. It feels like people are tired of dealing with me.,Depression
7201,For a while my depression was dormant in a sense? For a few months I was not seeing the effects and I just was not feeling like shit all the time. For the past few weeks however its been horrible and unmanageable and the tole it takes on my body just makes me feel even more depressed.I am losing alot of weight stress acne my hygiene is horrible I cannot find the motivation to fix my nails or unbraid my hair several red patches all over my skin from scratching from the anxiety brough on scars etc. I feel ugly and I do not even recognize myself in the mirror when I get the courage to look. My friends want to hangout with me soon and I do not know if I can bring myself to leave my house. Aside from not wanting to ruin everyone is mood I also look as shitty as I feel. I am going to feel humiliated if I step out of my house like this especially since my friends are all so well dressed and pretty. This fucking sucks. Depression taking a tole on my physical appearance is the cherry ontop of this shit pile.,Depression
8199,I have been dealing with an emotional ache feeling in my heart for the past 3 years that generally comes and goes and I am not sure how it developed and why I am feeling it. Any ideas how I can go about understanding what is happening? Emotional ache in heart for 3 years. Still not sure why?,Depression
9041,Hi guys I am a 18F and I feel like I am falling back into a state of depression. I feel like part of it is because it is summer break so I feel like I have nothing productive to do. Throughout the day I am just in a constant state of sadness although idk if it would be considered depression. I sometimes find myself thinking about death even though I am not necessarily suicidal. I do not really have the motivation to do anything productive and just laze around all day until its night time when I usually play games with my friends. This gives me some joy but then after it is done I fall back into that sad state. I feel like I have no one to talk to because I feel like I do not deserve to be depressed or sad. I do not have any financial struggles and I have a pretty good relationship with family and friends. I am hoping that once fall semester starts I will be out of this rut and instead be stressed about school LOL. Anyways thank you to anyone that actually reads this and listened to my rant . Constant state of sadness,Depression
7762,well i do not even know how to start this. I am so confused and lonely. just as info I am a 17 yo female.i have no idea if i even have depression but reading all of your stories i recognize myself in most of them so i guess I am one of you. I have been experiencing extreme selfhatred for the past 5 years triggered by a tragic event in my life and then developing rapidly. its like my thoughts are my biggest enemy and I am constantly bringing myself down for the things i do and the way i look.generally i do not share personal thoughts with people its actually the first time i am speaking about this. i just ignored it but lately its been getting so troublesome i cannot sleep and I am always in a bad mood. suicidal thoughts have been coming up as well which scares me a lot.furthermore i just feel apathy towards everything and everyone. yesterday i got my first job offer and i just felt numb. i know I am not worthy and i do not deserve it so i just did not tell anyone about it even if it was an achievement. same thing with good grades i just do not care anymore. guilt has also been my best friend throughout these years. something happens and then i just put the guilt on myself. its like i know it straightaway even before considering the situation.its just getting worse after every day and i am really lost. thanks for reading and sorry i bothered you with my thoughts. just another depressed buddy here,Depression
7885,I hate myself for everything I had ever done in my life. I think this could help me. do not question it.

Roast me as badly as you can,Depression
8603,Hello everyoneI am considering starting psychotherapy again. I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically even if there is nothing going on I feel constant anguish distress anxiety and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus to me there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish anxiety and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harmhurt me due to survival instincts for instance in business or for money. This also causes my anxiety. ampx200BI appreciate any thought idea and help. Thank you How can I overcome my feelings of anguish distress anxiety and existential pain?,Depression
7443,I currently live in WV and I honestly hate it. Most of my friends and family live here which I feel would hurt me some emotionally but I just do not feel like I will ever be happy here or free. Just trying to gain insight on others that have moved and left most of their family and friends were you happier? Did it feel like starting over? Thanks in advance. Moving out of state opinions?,Depression
7711,I have been postinf here lately. Idk I think I am just trying to release some pressure. I think I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted. I grew up with zero friends no friends at all. I felt sad about it for several years... but I feel like this no more. Getting hookups on tinder making temporary friends casual chat with other Xbox players and never talking with them again. I think I stopped GAFOS. Yes it is good to exchange some messages and stuff but I just do not care about other people's feelings anymore. I became a cynical person. My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say what I do. Not trying to be edgy trust me. But I think I got to a point where I am dead inside and I do not care if people see it anymore. I have two friends I met both of them here. Good people I hope we can still talk love ya but I simply do not care about others. I feel no empathy no remorse nothing. I know I should seek help and blah blah blah. But the world is just... I fought for my life many years. Tried to seek help went to therapy that kind of stuff. But I just cannot see any hope. I go outside and I feel sick. People is just so selfish ignorant and not a single one of them gives a fuck about others.I worked as a paramedic for a couple of years donated to charities tried to be a good person. But the world took me down. I do not know I think this might be it. This is my life from now on. Not feeling anything. Enjoying my loneliness and feeling empty at the same time. This is it. This is it... I do not know if I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted or just getting used to it. Becoming a cynical person pt.1,Depression
9012,This year things seemed to be doing good finally got on t and mood started to stabilize to the point where I was not having meltdowns in broom closets at work dailyNow into the summer it comes backYear before this was in inpatient because I was hearing shit that was not there and decided to hospitalize myself because it was making me suicidal Year before that was out on leave for 4 months again around the same time of year late summerlate November that time because my doctor upped the dosage of a medication that fucked up my mood dissorder severelyYear before that was because I was suicidal was pre t hospital staff threatened to tackle me if I did not remove my chest flattening garment and kept me in a hallway full of strangers and misgendered me the entire time had a meltdown in front of said strangers who began to openly mocked me. I cannot afford to keep hospitalizing myself and if I try to just go back to my job I am going to end up killing myself there is nearly a 100 foot drop from the balcony to the floor in the building I am working in I have thought about it I have never gone too far but have had attempts through other means. it is going to be complaining and saying hey something is wrong and I need actual financial support and therapy from someone trained to handle trauma in a way that is not just telling me I have anxiety and that what is going on is normal I need help or I am going to die and no one will take me seriously until it actually happens. The only reason I am not dead now is because the thought of people going wow we had no idea this would happen makes me physically ill. cannot fucking do this shit anymore always back to square one,Depression
8620,I do not think it matters what I do but I will never matter to anyone. All I am good for is to pay bills and work... My spouse took me to this place he would been raving about he had taken my daughter a few weeks back. We went and he acted nervous or like he was waiting for someone or maybe he was just embarrassed to be seen with me. Thinking back he walked behind me or not near me the entire time. Then yesterday while I was working he went back again. What bothers me more is he who does not even like Chinese kept pushing how he would go there to get ME food. I was not asking for it I did not care what food was purchased. I felt manipulated but also was in the middle of work an it did not seem like the time to pry. I do not want to stop him from being happy either. It feels very manipulative to me. When he came back he was happy an ate and went back to sleep. He spent the rest of the evening on his phone till I went to sleep then had trouble sleeping and stayed up all night. This has become a cycle apparently he only gets good sleep when I am awake. I keep thinking he is going to leave since last fall. Everyday I am prepared for him to tell me how he does not love me that he never did. Every time he takes me somewhere public as I push my cart I think is now when he is going to drop the It is whatever you want statement with 'because I am leaving you. He has started saying the it is whatever you want what makes you happy ect. These phrases combined with the fact that he will not even come near me. I have been here before... I am trying to get more hours at work and you know accept it. He looks disgusted when he looks at me he does not want to be anywhere near me and there is no amount of putting lipstick on this pig to change it. My parents could not love me. My grandparents could not. How could anyone else want me in their life? I am just not good enough for anyone. I Will Never Be Good Enough,Depression
8015,Today was the first day weeks where I felt like I could breathe. Work went well I am finally coming to terms with the fact that I might lose my best friend nothing reminded me of traumatic stuff and I did not cry. I really hope I reach a point where everyday can be like this. today was good.,Depression
7229,Hi I want to talk about my experience I just want to talk to someone about a friend that passed away in 2012 Severe depression with a friend that killed themselves in 2012,Depression
8321,How do you even begin to explain your depression? I am hurting and I feel super alone. I have people around me and I am sure they will listen but to what extent? I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely selfaware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster though he has shown no intention of this at all. Who wants to be married to a crazy person right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents who are incredible by the way. My biological mother who was physically and emotionally abusive is still a piece of work putting it nicely. It took years but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child and I have not but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long. Honestly I could write a novel because there are so many subcategories to what is adding to my mental health crisis but where do you even start when you have never been heard?I am so tired. I do not even know anymore,Depression
8080,I am Newley married and my suicidal thoughts are coming back! I want to love everyone and that is important to being the person I want to be but I keep getting thoughts where I look at someone and for no reason get a thought like she is a bch no reason to believe that and I definitely do not think that I just see them or hear them. Its eating me alive and I feel like I am this horrid person cuz they feel like they will never go away. My wife I love her to death and do not want to leave her but I have started contemplating suie again. I hate this because I feel like I am this horrid human having these thoughts then just my anxiety compounds and I thought I was done with all this depression stuff so why am I feeling this way again I have not contemplated suie since I was like 1617 and I am 21 now! Any advice on anything cuz as of now I cannot afford therapy! I just kind of needed to vent thank you for any comments! TW Newley wed and desperate,Depression

8729,How do I handle someone constantly complaining and negative and down and trying to always support them and help them while being depressed myself but a huge people pleaser. My partner shows when they are down everybody will know it. They will complain all the time and not really talk to me and it will be like that everyday for days. They wanted to move to another country to study and and I chose to go with them as I could not handle the relationship to end. I studied hard for an exam to be able to get in and gave a lot of effort just for them to tell me that they will be depressed there too and do not know why the changed countries in the first place and so on. It is something they really wanted and now that they got it they are not satisfied .I know what it is like to be depressed so I am not saying everything should be fixed but nothing is appreciated and everything is being complained about and I try so hard. I am numb and tired but even when I am at my worst I will still talk to them and try my best to make them laugh and smile. I am not actively suicidal but I wish every night to not wake up. Sometimes they even say that a lot of their negative emotions come from me and my family situation which I cannot change. It is like no one has it as bad as them. I feel alone egoistic and like a bad partner for even complaining right now as I should just be supporting I do love them Relationships and Depression,Depression
8550,You ever notice? Therapists will see you for 45 mins once a week at most a psychiatrist will maybe see you once a month if you are lucky and the rest of the time? Just deal with your own shit. Are you miserable?Wallowing in your bed all day? Too sad to brush your own teeth or hair? Crying at the smallest thing? Ready to die but not able to muster the effort to plan it?Oh fcking well. Handle it. No one wants you to reach out. Mental health professionals just want to help the Karens of the world with their drinking problems so they can take Little Billy to soccer practice without getting a DUI and then all the therapists and psychiatrists can go home to their wonderful well adjusted families and think about what nice people they are because they help people when really they have helped no one. Everyone says Reach out when you need help but when you reach out it is almost impossible to get help unless you are actively endangering your life or someone else's.,Depression
9129,For the record I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 20 year old man. I have had a sudden and heartbreaking breakup that put me over the edgeThanks Alaida and I am in a horrible spot mentally. Was going to kill myself but she convinced me before we split but I did some slashing to my wrist. I have been trying to contact her but she just blocks me and that is got me down bad. My psychiatrist thinks I am a danger to myself and also suggests ketamine therapy but I am scared to be separated from my pc. Idk what to do. I want Alaida back but she hates me and I am scared off hospital. Just want the pain to end tbh My psychiatrist suggests that I go to hospital. What is it like?,Depression
7665,I often get confused by my own depression. I think to myself how can I be depressed? I have many friends a successful job that I have earned being employed at the same company for 9 years I am in college working on my 3rd degree I am proud of myself and generally have a pretty good relationship with myself. I have been in therapy for over 10 years. I am from a family of addicts I have been sober for 10 years with no desire to relapse. All in life is fairly good I really have no complaints other than the normal stresses of life. Yet I have these episodes where I completely shut down. I will be high functioning for good periods of time than BOOM! I am out of commission for a few days where I put myself back together. Does anyone else suffer like this?

7745,Hey I am new to this forum so I may be asking redundant questions. I have been through the exhaustive list of various antidepressants talk therapy acupuncture etc and am investigating more alternatives. I am scheduled to start a course of 36 TMS treatments and I am hopeful but I have been hopeful before. Does anyone have any experience with medical marijuana for depression? Or resourcesstudiesliterature?Thanks much. Treatments you have tried? TMS? Medical marijuana?,Depression
7904,Gee I never thought about that. you are absolutely right I spend days at a time feeling like this because I want to. I absolutely want to kill myself for funsies. Its definitely not a crippling feeling of helplessness and despair. As a matter of fact I will get rid of my asthma by just breathing. I will get over my pollen allergies by simply not sneezing. I will take all my ailments and get rid of them by just doing the opposite of what they prevent me from doing. Thank you so much for curing my depression. Seriously I fucking hate just be happy! People with a passion. It feels like they are just blaming you for your depression because you do not want to be happy enough and they bestow this knowledge on you like its something brand fucking new. Maybe I am overanalyzing it but even still I wish people understood it more. Maybe if people made an effort to understand we would have a cure or something right now. But for now we are stuck with people with perfect lives and pristine mental health telling us to just not suffer from chemical imbalances. Just go out and be happy! Go do things you like! Enjoy your youth!,Depression

7831,So introduction I guess.. my name is Michael and I am 20 yo. I live in Slovakia though I would be surprised if anybody knew where that is located. And I am struggling with..I do not know maybe deppresion?The problems started like long time ago back when I was still a child. My mum hated the fuck out of my dad and for some reason my dad hated her too. My dad is like the typical stereotype guy who thinks that woman should be in kitchen taking care of her husband. He was and still is to be honest addicted to alcohol. I remember when I was a child and my mum had to go away for a couple of days that everytime my dad stepped through front door I prayed to god because I was always afraid that he arrives drunk again. I was so genuinely happy when he did not and I always hid in my closet when he did. In school I was not very popular. I am the kind of guy who thinks that if you have the means if you have the option and ability to help somebody you should by all means do that. Of course people tend to take advantage of that. Everytime they needed something I would do it eventhough if it meant that I had to spent 4 hours doing their homework or writing an essay. Of course I was bullied too when they did not need me because why the fuck not right I deserved that. I did not have a single true friend everybody I considered to be my friends they insulted me and humilliated me most of the time and I did not like it. I was so alone that I just decided that I had to have a friend. And that is when my schizophrenia probably started.I made myself a friend. He is called Martin Ladec I even created him a facebook account so I could chat with him because I had always wanted to have friend that I could chat with on facebook. Everytime I was alone I talked to him. My imaginary best friend. It all started like nothing too serious every conversation I had with him always played in my head like I only imagined that I was talking to him because I had known that he was not real. But then I started talking out loud to him.. It just went like this I do not really know how to explain it properly. I just sat on the ground and started crying and telling him how I was feeling but after I was done talking I got up smiled at the spot where I had been crying and tried to reassure the spot you know like if I was Martin cheering up Michael. After some time I got better but then I started hearing voices it was around 8th or 9th grade. They were telling me how pitiful I was that I should kill myself that everybody hated me. I started to feel really deppressed and it was not helping when the actual people were telling me how pitiful I am and how they hated me. So at the end of elementary school my mind was shattered like glass into so many parts. Part that wants to kill me other part who argues with the first part and telling me to live Martin and myself.Then the high school came and I found new friends..like true friends. I liked them so much and they seemed to like me too. There was this particular guy that I enjoyed spending my time with we had so much in common. He loved the same type of music I did movies TV series and so on. Of course I had fallen in love with him. I did not even realized that I was gay but when I did I just went along with it. But I loved and still I love him so much..I guess I was really obsessed with him. I was jealous everytime he went out with somebody else of course i did not tell him I am not dumb I knew it would ruin everything I was thinking of him everytime I went to bed and everytime I woke up. He had a best friend our classmate and the three of us started hanging out a lot. It got to a point when we had like really deep shit conversation and I remember that the other guy not the one I love told me because he could see that I had been struggling The stupidest thing that a person can do when he has some problems is that he never tells anyone about those problems. Talk about it. and then the guy I loved said We are telling everything to each other. Tell us. And I told them because I believed in them. I told them about the voices and about Martin and everything. It went fine it seemed they believed me but of course.. shit had to get worse. for the sake of this the guy I love is T and his best friend is SAt one point I do not know what happened but S accused me of lying. He said that nothing that happened to me never really happened to me and that I like the attention I am getting because of that and I just want people to pity me. He told other guys in my class and so I became the guy who is constantly lying exaggerating and deppressed. I never stopped talking to them though. I understood that this shit is really hard to believe. T was still my number 1 friend because he seemed that he still believed me. I started to love him even more. I have always had money I did not even know how. From insurance when my grandma and aunt died and what they left me. So always when I needed or wanted something I had it. And he did not have the luck he had like no money. Like he was not poor or anything but when he wanted Converse for example he could not afford. And I felt selfish because I had the money and he did not so I felt like it would be really selfish of me not to buy things for him. I bought him those. And trousers. And jackets. And games on ps4 which by the waay I bought just so I could play with him . I remember that once he told me how much he dreamed of getting a new computer but his mum did not let him have it. So I literally started building my own new pc for 600 eventhough the one I currently had was completely fine. The old one I had cost me around 500. I told I am that I had built myself a new pc so I can give him my old one. For free. And I did. I literally spent on him around 600 because I gave him my monitor because he did not have one and I had to buy myself a new one. And I still was so happy when I bought those things for him and gave those things to him. I loved him so much like this is probably the true love you know.Then last year came and it all went to shit. It was my last year on my school and we had a party the entire class after Stukova. Stukova is like the Ball you have in last year of high school. After Stukova you have Dozvuky where all students just drink a lot . S dated my classmate but they broke up before Dozvuky. I was really good friend with S' ex at that time. I am not going to explain what happened exactly this post is long enough even without those details but basically S fooled around with two girls. Two girls his ex hated the most. She was really sad and I was talking to her the entire time. After Dozvuky and everything I met him and he told me that I really fucked up. He told me that I disgust him and if I feel hurt that I deserve it. He blamed me for something I did not do. He did not want me to explain to him and he stopped talking to me. In the same week every guy from our class stopped talking to me including T and I realized that he told them his version and they all feel same as him about me. It could not come in worse moment. I was feeling during this time deppressed a lot. I had a friend M She was like my best friend after S and T. She knew that I was gay and she knew that I loved T. Still she fooled around with him when we had parties. When I was there. 3 times. Everytime she did it she told me that she was sorry and promised me she would never do it again. And she did it two more times. One time i was in the same bed as T and M and they started making out next to me. It was the worst feeling ever because I loved him so much and she knew and still she did it. I was heartbroken and defeated and I started cutting myself. And then S dumped me because of the misunderstanding and every guy dumped me and I was alone again. Fortunately I am not that stupid and I realized that I coudln't continue like this. I am proud of myself that I realized that I need professional help because most people cannot do it.So I started looking for a psychologist at first.Someone to talk to. I tried 9 different ones. And they all told me the same thing. Only time can help. I did the Rorschach test numerous times and still they were not able to find anything wrong with me eventhough my every goddamn answer was really deppressing negative and not positive at all. I cut myself. I hear voices telling me that I should kill myself or the ones that hurt me. I created an imaginary friend. For fuck sake even I as a patient was able to realize that something is a bit fucking fishy about me. They did not help. One psychologist even tried to touch my thigh. So that much for proffessional help. So I started looking for a psychiatrist . I told him the same story and he gave me pills. Arisppa. It did not help. The best part is that I told him that I had told S about my voices and stuff and how I hurt felt when he did not believe me and accused me of being a drama queen and guess what did the fucking psychiatrist asked? Michael are you telling me the truth? Do you really hear the voices or have you made this all up just to skip school or be different? To let people pity you? Is this even possible in modern world? in which fucking dimension would sane psychiatrist ask such a dumb question? I snapped and I started laughing hysterically after that. I was laughing at my place for good 3 hours and then I started crying. And laughing after that. Some people just insult those who kill themselves and say that it is selfish decision. I totally understand suicide now. I have problems I accept that. I wanted help I desperatelly needed help but everything is against me. In this world if you are not selfish bastard you cannot be happy. This world is not made for people like me. it is really easy to say that get some help because apparently nobody can help. Like I do not even know if anybody is going to read this or not. But if some lost sould read this entire novel to the end just wanted to let you know that do not worry I promise I WILL NOT kill myself. I tried sure but I am not strong enough to do that. Besides my paranoid me thinks that it would make other guys happy and I do not want to give them this satisfaction.Honestly I do not know what I expected from this. I do not know if I want your help because I know you cannot help me. But I tried everything. Psychologists psychiatrists telling friends group therapies fucking taiwan mantras to calm my mind tropical teas and herbs to soothe my mind. Nothing worked so I just thought fuck it let us give it a shot. Maybe miracle will happen. do not know what else to do so I just leave it up here,Depression
7015,Today is the last day of being 27. Tbh I always thought I will die way before 28. Life is not great right now. I still have A LOT of issues with my depression and taking different types of pills most of the days I do not have the tiniest bit of focus and feel mad and upset for no reason. Still I managed to keep my job and my alcohol consumption under control. It sucks but I also have a big exam tomorrow right on my birthday. Wish me luck Going to be 28 tomorrow never though I will make it this far,Depression
8886,I was happy with some friends after the subway ride home i sit in my room feeling empty again and lost hope in my life A while ago,Depression
8878,For the last few weeks I have been struggling to get out of bed for a reason too even occasionally skipping breakfast. Been annoyed by others for a small reason like the way they breathe or walk to the point I lie to people who know me just to avoid being near them. I do not like getting out anymore because I now spend my time looking at people and wondering why I do not come out as normal when I do the same as them and the paranoia of them looking at me makes me want to be angered to the point of a migraine. Have been treating people I do not know with hostel words and actions because I believe I am more physically capable to hurt them or that the consequences are not enough for me to care. Have acted in blatant predatory and manipulative behavior. we are I fallow people in public from inside stores to parks to their cars I do not even know why. I had been dragged out to a party with my cousin and he told me that he had been threatened by another guy there. Said it got to the point he was scared he would be hurt and asked me to help. I then spent the next two hours going to his bothers car Walmart to get a bat and followed him home. I parked a block away and walked by the trees with the bat at hand. He then got out so walked after got close enough that I whistled and busted his knee and ankle and ran like hell. The only problem is that I like to much. Been so used to my mother and others telling me what to do that I struggle to get things done to the point where I keep making my personality up as I go to make myself normal since I was told by my teachers and parent. Always hated everyone else since I was a kid only having friends knowing that if I do not I would have either kind myself or someone else out of the hated I get filling myself with distractions to avoid myself. I am starting to break and all these lies of morality fake friendships and saying I am ok even tho I want to bash a skull is too much to handle I am on the edge of freaking out and self hated and honestly a little scared just need suggestions. I want to yell but cannot,Depression
7848,Sorry for bad english and if I cannot post these things but maybe can someone drop some goods methods to end myself? Painless way to end myself?,Depression
8212,I am not sure that this is the right place to do this sorry if it is not. Also sorry for bad english in advance it is been a long time since i talked to anyone and in addition i am german.I am 25m and my first Girlfriend left me in April after 7 12 years. She told me I am going to find someone better and she is right. I live in my mom's basement. I never had a job i do not want a job and i do not think I will ever be able to have one.I feel like i do not deserve to live but i somehow want to just not like this. But i could not change anything for the better even if i wanted to. So what is the point? All i can do is think about the things that permanently ruined my body and mind.My very first memory is attending the funeral of my grandpa i was 5 years old back then. At school i have been beaten. They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. short explanation every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day all day i am in my room in the basement. If i try to go for a walk I will end up in panic because i do not want to go out there and on the way back again because i do not want go back into my room.My Girlfriend helped me get therapy. But they came to the conclusion that i am a hypochondriac simply because they never heard of my disease before and did not bother to look it up or tried to put me in group therapy completely disregarding my disease and then blaming me for not wanting help because i am afraid of people. And since then i... Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late. I have the greatest respect for her to endure me but i also hate her for leaving me like that and all the things she said before breaking off contact. Now i am alone.I have got no one to talk. No one that cares except about my financials which is all my mom ever cared about besides her work. I cannot stay awake during day and i cannot sleep at night. I will never be happy again. I will never enjoy anything.All i can think of is that death seems to be the only way out...I would at least like to talk to someone again and just not be alone...It would be nice to not be ignored once. I just got this urge to tell someone everything about me. I hope i will not regret this.,Depression
8994,So I am a few months shy of 21 I have been struggling with depression since I was 14 and right now my life has gone through some drastic changes that have affected my mental health. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in medicine I used to be a nursing student now I am seeking medical school and that associated with quarantine made me spend a lot of time home.Because of this I have been dealing with constant homophobia by my family especially my father and brother and more unrequested comments about everything I do. This has led my down a darker path I have stopped studying running I was a marathonist gained 20kg from anxiety eating and I barely brush my teeth. I have gone back to selfharming pretty much every day after being clean for 4 months and have planned to take my own life on August 1st even wrote my goodbyes to my family and my girlfriend. I want to get help I know I am not okay and just found out my insurance covers psychiatric interventions yayyy but I am a bit scared to go there since I during psych rotations in nursing school I dealt with some pretty scary situations. I would love some insight about what it is like in there and here your thought about itThanks in advance have a wonderful day Has anyone here ever been to a psych ward? If so what is it like?,Depression
7695,No one cares. No one is interested. My life is a joke. I feel like I have no one. What is the point? Done,Depression
7365,Hey. I have a lot of stuff going on right now and I am really struggling. I just finished graduate school and got my masters degree. I should be thrilled but I am everything but. I feel like I just lost a huge part of myself. And I am not looking for a job and cannot get any interviews. I have applied to 810 jobs and was told 6 or 7 times I was not what they were looking without even an interview. I do not know what to do. My current job is a work study job that requires me to be a student. My last day is Friday . My sister is about to move to college. I am so beyond proud but it scares me because I will not see her every day. I know they say call or FaceTime but it is not the same. My brother is actively trying to move out. I am the oldest sibling yet I still live at home. I cannot drive. I have so little work experience that no one wants to hire me. I feel pathetic alone lost scared depressed worthless. Its so much to deal with and I feel alone in it. When I try to talk to my family about it all I hear is do not dwell. I wish it was so easy! I do not know what to do. Too much!,Depression
7082,Now I am 28 and wasted too much opportunities. Wasted years not working on my dreams and creative ambitions...,Depression
7101,I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and put a shelter over ours heads. For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me You are going to be a doctor so you should know this. The only thing I know is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them You should have never became parents or I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parentsMy parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore.. It feels like it keeps getting worse,Depression
8516,Idk if its the right sub for this but currently I am fucking depressed because I am withdrawing from a drug yeah addict lifestyle. I am with my family right now should be happy but I am not. When I think about I do not even remember the last time I was truly happy. This is been going on for years and the withdrawal only makes it worse. People think I am lazy and do not want to do anything but that is simply not true. I have goals too that I want to reach but sometimes things get too much. I am surely not as depressed as some of you I just needed to let this out once since I cannotwill not tell anyone. Severely depressed because of withdrawal,Depression
7013,If you could understand maybe you would see why I am so angry so hurt so destroyed. I know from your perspective maybe you see someone who is hurting maybe you see someone who needs help.ampx200BBut if you could look beyond my eyes behind my face. The constant struggle to just be alright and it feels like you are completely alone because you actually are. Alone in this desolate wasteland with crumpled buildings decimated roadways and highways. ampx200BTwisted metal signs relics of the past. With old directions guiding to better places than here. The ghosts of yesterday yelling out from the corridors of collapsed buildings as the wind whistle through the burned out city. The sun glaring down as dark clouds approach gusts of wind kicking up large plumes of dust in the distance heading for the city as lightning begins to strike and bombs begin to drop.ampx200BWithin a moment you are surrounded by flashes of memories all over all around you and in the winds you can hear the faint voices some screaming some crying some are my own voice filled with regret and sorrow and loss.ampx200BThe flashes are so intense that the images of memories begin to bleed together as you see my life unfold in bits and pieces and for a moment just a brief second you see me for who I really am but I whisp away into the surrounding debris just as quick as you can blink. As though it were just a ghost just a projection of all the things I wished I could ever be. Strewn to the wind and shattered into a million pieces as you look onward trying to make sure you were not just imagining things. ampx200BThe storm still flickering lightning and gunfire sounds in the fractured buildings echo around you as all sunlight fades and just as quickly as it came the storm has passed.ampx200Byou are left still wondering if everything you saw was real or not. That image of me the forgotten dreams the screams. How much was real? How much was just your mind trying to put the pieces together? ampx200BAll these questions and doubts like the particles of dust now drifting further away. Like a candy wrapper caught in the wind the idea of ever knowing dies alongside the winds as they begin to settle and the sun blares bright again.ampx200BYou put your hand above your eyes to shade them from the sun as you look to the sky in some hope if seeing more storm clouds. They say every cloud has a silver lining but none of these clouds seem to be anything but black darkness harsh. ampx200BUntil you realize that you do not have to be here and your sight zooms out slowly revealing my eyes and the pain they hide as you travel back behind your own eyes and see this figure in front of you torn by war and so much pain. Not quite human but the figure tries.ampx200BJust as quickly as that image popped up during the storm then dissipated the notion of who this creature is in front of you begins to blur. A hollowed out she will of all the grand things that could have been. ampx200BIt is then I think you would begin to understand that there is nothing left here in front of you worth salvaging and so it would just be easier simpler to walk away. My bad place,Depression
7719,Idk if it is placebo or really happening but i genuinely feel a bit better id like if anyone shares a similar experience. Took a Vitamin C ampule and feeling better,Depression
8036,So sad and weak to even type words I do not use social media so nobody knows I am sad,Depression
8074,I am tired of being alone. I do not have any friends to talk to or hang out with and I have never dated anybody before. I was a loner in school and did not make any friends I sat by myself everyday at lunch and never had anybody to talk to. My dating life is the same way since I never really had friends I never got the chance to talk to any girls either. I have never dated a girl or been in a relationship with one. I am 23 and live by myself and honestly I have a pretty good life. I am responsible independent have money saved up and I always have a job. I am doing really well for myself especially for my age. It would just be nice to have somebody to reach out to or some people to hang out with. I would also like to start dating but I have no idea how to meet girls especially when you have no friends. I have just been going about my life the last few years but I am starting to get really depressed. I do not want to be alone like this 2030 year's from now and it seems like now that I am out of school and working it is even harder to meet people. The only time I meet new people is at work. I know I obviously need to make friends but how? I play my guitar go fishing cook and I also like to read. I know what I need to do i just do not know how to do it...like how does somebody who has zero friends just starting making them? And how can I start getting in the dating scene? And please do not say online dating I have tried it already. I just seriously need help with my situation because I think about this every day and I really start to get depressed sometimes. Anybody who replies to this post your advice is greatly appreciated thank you! I seriously need help,Depression

8914,Why have I been unemployed for 1.5 years? Why am I 22 and living with my parents and barely able to do anything?I should have killed myself a long time ago. The only thing I am good at is music. I just wish I was someone else What is wrong with me,Depression
7653,Okay so I have this friend I made in school. One time there was like this show going on in my school in the auditorium and I threw one of my popcorn piece on another kid jokingly then when the kid looked my way my friend immediately pointed her finger at me so that she will not get blamed for my actions which really hurt me.. What should I do? Should I drop her for snitching on me? Help Friends or not,Depression
8762,it is impossible to be happy in this cold cruel world. Everything's got to be serious and unfun. I had just spent a day being happy and productive and had thought that I could finally live a chill life being this way but boom my dad starts lecturing me and telling me he is sick of me gaming and will check my bedroom every night at 1pm to make sure I am sleeping. I am 21. The moment I heard that I knew that a chill life will never happen. Nor will I be happy. This is a life of cruelty and suffering one that will not let me take a break. I cannot just move out I will die in the cold. I need to let go of my happy demeanor and become cold since that is what the world demands of me. it is impossible to be happy,Depression
9116,I did it I successfully pushed away everyone absolutely everyone the one I love my friends my family have not spoken to anyone in months.Barely said 2 words to the ppl I live with I work 107 shower sleep and repeat over and over. I do not remember if I ate most days. I have not found joy in the things I used to love I have not smiled or laughed and I am actually okay with that.If I am not around I cannot hurt them right? Lay me down in a bed of roses,Depression
8676,I have tried everything people recommend and kept at it for several months exercising meditating going out in the sun talking to people being grateful etc...I still have a negative mindset and feel like crap on most days. The exercise does not matter yeah I have more muscles so what? how is that of use? I wish I cared more about my body but I do not really. Meditating just leaves me with my bad thoughts for too long. Being grateful for minute things just reminds me that I have not achieved big things etc... The cycle continues and I feel powerless to climb up from the hole I dug myself. Nothing seems to help to get me out of this funk...,Depression
8577,that is it I am just soo dam tired. cannot wait for a good night sleep apparently I am due one in 5 years time. I am exhausted,Depression
8348,Like wtf is wrong with me yo. Literally never enough..,Depression
8563,This is going to be a long and not first post on this subreddit.I am a 22 year old man and even though I do not like it either when these posts start with a list of things people do not like about themselves they suffer from eucharist syndrome I am going to I believe these are in relation with my problems. I am gay autistic virgin pursuing a useless degree we will return to this no driving lisence barely any money under on my name and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion drive or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school they wanted me to mingle with other elite kids which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life crying and begging my parents not to make me go there can you guess wheter they listened? I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here sheltering sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything but wierdly enough people see me as normalacting sic! I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TLDR Years of abandonment avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is selffulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS. There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant. CW Suicide Why I might commit suicide very soon advice and consultation welcome!,Depression
7883,So my fiance has came to a conclusion that I am not worth her her while. What can I do to keep myself busy? Fiance cut everything off,Depression
7917,Lately life has not been the best for me I have been avoiding my family and ignoring their phone calls because I just do not want to talk. I miss family events because I do not want them to see me and ask why I am not okay. Everyday I wake up a wave of grief and depression just wash over me and I hate it. Everyday of my life is a battle and I am getting closer to my edge. I feel like my life is going no where and that the best thing for me to do is just end it all I obviously did not succeed in this life therefore there is no point in being around just existing without a purpose. I try to talk to my mom and to my brother but they do not understand they think its not as serious but they have no idea the turmoil and pain that goes on in my mind. I have so much PTSD from my life. In 2018 my grandpa cousin and brother all died. My brother was killed by his friend on his own daughters birthday and my cousin was murdered at a red light in Los Angeles. that is not even the tip of the iceberg. Throughout my life I have lost so many friends and family to gun violence and I hate it. I grew up going to funerals and seeing my loved ones die young . I feel like I have the same fate in store for me and I am just waiting for the day to come . I never liked living in this world and feeling all this pain and having no one to talk to . It just sits in my head all day . I know no ones going to see this but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Sorry for bothering. Just please check up on your family members when you know they are not okay. Sometimes a small thing like asking someone if they are okay is the difference between them ending their lives and them not doing it Trapped in my head,Depression
7760,I fell for my straight friend and its the worst thing ever. We hang out and watch movies together sometimes and those are the happiest moments of my life. I feel genuinely happy when I am with him but once I am alone again I fall right back into depression. Hanging out with him is the only thing that still brings me joy and I am terrified of losing him. I cannot stop thinking about him. I feel like I do not live at all when I am not with him so I just keep remembering the things we did together. I know Ill never be more than a friend to him no matter how much I wish I could. I have told him I had feelings for him before but he just brushed it off and pretended it never happened. Sometimes I wonder if he actually cares about me or if I mean anything to him. Loving him hurts so much but I do not know how to stop. I wish I could not feel love,Depression
8206,Sorry for the mistakes English is my second languageSo i have a depressed friend nonclinical but he is really struggling with it and I am his comfort friend so i often have to help him when depression strikes but lately i do not know how to deal with him anymore.do not get me wrong I am his friend and i always be there for him I have tried to cheer him up i tried to tell him that he is not a bad person that his problems matter but it does not seem to affect him how many times i say that he is not a monster it just seems to get worse I have tried to tell him that he needs to see a doctor or a psychiatrist but he does not want to. I have the feeling that he is not trying to get up and fight he just likes to lay down and feel bad for himself.So i was talking with a friend clinical depression beaten 4y ago and he told me that i should not give him that much attention because he might get and sometimes it is just worse.So now i do not know what to do i really want to help him but i do not know how and i do not want to worse things up. that is why I came here how do you help a depressed friend? How to help a depressed person?,Depression
7278,I am between the ages of 11 and 15 not specifying and I just feel alone. After my gf broke up with me I just feel not loved. I know my parents love me but it just does not feel like it. I also have every physical belonging I have ever wanted but I never feel like its enough. I do not want to socialize which means I am never going to find anyone and I can only talk to a stranger for like 15 minutes and then I just feel really claustrophobic. I just want to die. I feel too young to be this way,Depression
7156,And I cannot pretend anymore that they do not make me feel like shit. Them telling me otherwise does not make me feel any better or that it is a joke. does not matter to me it hurts my feelings and I am tired of convincing myself that it does not. I feel like my friends hate me,Depression
7903,I am struggling to get past a traumatic event that was due to someone else's actions that made me disabled.I believe this is the sole because of my depression. I cannot get past it and I keep thinking about what life would have been like if it did not happen. I want to stop thinking about it but every morning I wake up that is all I can think about.Hope you are all having a good day.Take care How do you get over a really bad event that happened to you?,Depression
7729,I am 16F and for the past year and so have been struggling with depression and low self esteem. Evert opportunity I get to improve myself I blow it off and make up excuses. I am tried because I want to be better and do better but its like I am unable to or scared. Idk how to get out of this and I am just really tired of it. Does anyone have ways to get out of this ? Excuses,Depression
8972,i cannot put into words how deeply sad and lonely i feel. every night i stay up feeling like shit. no friends no social life and no career going or schooling. i try to socialize with people but i guess I am just bad at it. i feel like absolutely nobody wants me around or enjoys my company. i really do not know what I am going to do from here but i hope it turns out better. the worst I have ever felt ,Depression
8546,Heard this for well over a decade now. How can anyone be happy considering all the global some local issues we face? The one thing that should be a constant is not. That is people. People do not stick around. No loyalty. I want to be dead so badly. It does not get better does it?,Depression
7389,Vent F21here. Its been more than a year about something that is been bothering me so much. Its a burden and guilt I cannot seem to be able to share or vent with my closest ones. I really want vent. Its breaking me. Vent F21here. Its been more than a year about something that is been bothering me so much.

7973,Basically what the question asks I just feel lonely and depressed sometimes but I do not feel like talking to anyone. This is especially late at night. I have a couple close friends and I do not really trust anyone in my family all that much. Any advice? What do you do when you are lonely but do not feel like talking to anyone?,Depression
8363,People suck. it is really hard for me to give a fuck when this is the world I have to go out into. Story on news 3 people in my town killed a kitten for fun. So over this world.,Depression
8768,No tears or anything just...its almost 5am i have not slept then suddenly I am thinking of a jacket i have not worn in a year and i tear up the place not even finding it. I just threw crap away and...idk how to feel right now. I think i just had a mini break down,Depression
7071,This morning I had an appointment with my mental health doctor along with my social worker. For about 15 minutes we went through the usual conversation about asking how things were with medication sleep etc.I then decided to be upfront about planning to kill myself after my birthday is done with 3rd of August. They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about. I think saying I do not want to live is the right way of putting it. Rather that I do not want to exist as I feel non existent anyway so that might as well be made a reality. I broke down for the first time on years this morning.,Depression
7105,I have always been very introverted but had pockets of close friends growing up. My problem is that I am bad at maintaining friendships and now I have zero friends. I am close to my spouse and kids but that is it. I do not have social media accounts I do not text people and now that I am working from home every day I barely interact with anyone from work other than emails and the occasional phone call. For the last 6 months I have very little job motivation and have started to eat unhealthily putting on some weight. Feeling completely isolated from society I have started to not care about COVID what is happening in the world and so forth. I still enjoy my solo hobbies though mostly gaming and watching TV. I only leave the house a few times a week for some exercise in the park or for a swim with my son. I do not particularly feel lonely and have zero motivation to go out and make friends or join social activities. I never thought I could be depressed because outside of working hours I am quite contented. I joke around with my family I enjoy my gaming and so on. COVID has not affected me that much since I was a homebody before this all went down. But the lack of job motivation complete social isolation and inability to focus makes me wonder if I am in mild depression. I think I might be in the early stages,Depression
7813,Not sure if this is the best sub for this but I still think it is a good question.As someone who perhaps is not as socially skilled as it should be I watch a lot of selfimprovementsocial skills videos. The advice they give is say the things you do not think are worth saying or something along those lines to keep a conversation going. But my problem is I simply run out of things to say good or bad and I totally blank until the other person picks up the conversation.Is this something any of you relate to? Running out of things to say,Depression
7886,Instead of these swirling ferocious emotions nibbling at my heart and mind.Its these slight pains and aches in my chest thinking about the world and who I am.My confused emotions are still there but now they are getting fainter and dimmer. But still just as cruel.I am coming to the realization that I am a nobody with nothing special to give no talent no skill nothing monumental.I am just a dipshit with a pencil that looks like a child infront of professionals and aspiring artists.Watching my classmates go on with their lives in college living life to the fullest being happy with family. While I am sitting here waiting for this extra upcoming semester to actually graduate... like a fool.My social skills are nonexistent no wonder I have been dumped by people and shoved to the side by previous friends. No wonder I push people away as I regress into the deep crevices of my cracking mind.Do I exist just to torment myself and have those around me use me as a doormat.Why do I even exist? Why am I still alive.I am just waiting for when I am all alone in a shotty apartment with a shitty job. Idk how ill do it but it will happen. I will be disconnected from everyone nobody will know I had done it until my landlord checks up on me and sees me.I just have to wait... wait until I am out of here..It makes me hopeful my only point in this life is to kick the bucket early on.Took me this long to genuinely realize it.I wonder who will be the next me...Me as in the person I wanted to become a great artist a humble and gentle person a soft and timid heart a kind and sweet smile...Well I guess that is not actually me..I do not need help anymore I feel contempt..So why am I posting here.. Thought I would never be back,Depression
7785,When I am by myself with my thoughts I always start feeling really sad and lonely and depressed. I am an introvertor ambivert and I love being alone but there is also always a part of me that feels like something is missing and then I get depressed and anxious So far in the summer I have been pretty busy with my internship and hanging out with friends which means I felt this feeling less than before summer started. This for a moment made me feel that maybe my mental health was improving. However I finished my internship last week and this week I am spending more time at home and less time with friends. My plan was to get school work donebecause of procrastination I have not but idk I have began feeling sad again for no reason. I think its because I do not have the distraction of hanging out with people anymore to ignore my thoughts. Does anyone feel this too? Any suggestions to stop? Feeling sad and lonely and depressed for no reason,Depression
7946,I graduated with a BA degree in health in 2019 but took a break before I started to look for work. 2020 started with covid and the lockdown starting made it hard to find a job during that time. Even now it is hard finding a job that I am comfortable let alone experienced with.I also have a small fear or talking on the phone that I just hate. I could do it but I prefer not too since I know I am going to screw up on the job. I hate myself for being so weak and inexperienced Starting to get depressed because I cannot find a job I am comfortable with,Depression
7016,I have a close friend who has suffered from periods of depression for years. she is been doing well for the last year but for the past month has clearly been struggling. she is lonely and does not have anyone else in her life with whom to talk.When we do talk she has been dropping obvious signs that she is aware that she is become depressed but when I try to push her to go to counseling she gets annoyed and wants to change the subject. She admits that she should go but has no motivation to physically go. And she also has doubts that it would actually help based on past experiences.My question is how hard should I push her to get help? Should I keep bringing it up even when she says she does not want to talk about it? Should I tell her that I will not talk to her anymore if she does not go? Or should I give in ignore her depression and only talk about light topics.. maybe at least providing her social stimulus and relief from her own thoughts? How much pressure to apply to a friend to get help?,Depression
7703,I have had larger amounts of stress happen compared to now but it feels like I have only now caved from it. I left my job about two years ago to take care of my dad while I was in school. It was hell watching him get worse without being able to do anything. I still managed to stay on top of my grades and responsibilities. He passed months ago. Nothing seemed right after but I had to carry out his will handle his funeral etc. so it kept me from just sitting with my thoughts. About a week later I found out my SO was cheating with his kids mom. My grades slipped that semester but I got them back up and got a new job. Continued repeatedly dealing with shady behavior from SO and being promised change. My mom chose this period of time to behave like she had not in years disappeared when she met a guy and does not really come around and cancels when I have tried to come see her. My parents divorced when I was young she was not close with my dad.These past few weeks I feel I have let myself go. I was struggling with my classes and have just stopped working on them not even checking the grades. Letting my exnot ex SO continue to be around despite asking them to let me heal and move on. they have been attentive and loving and stopped drinking but it does not feel the same anymore. I do not think its fair to them because I do not have hope that were going to last and I do not know that I even feel sad about that after giving so many chances. Its not healthy for either of us when there is no trust. I procrastinate all responsibilities and do not really see myself with a good future anymore just getting through each day. I feel the panic of how bad I am messing up but will not do anything to start fixing it. I have just mentally checked out from everything aside from my job. I am not sure I want to see a doctor because I fear they will just send me on a journey of different medications to try. Even small tasks like calling a doctor seem strenuous. I do not want to talk to anyone I know about this because I know every person is dealing with their own problems and cannot really help with mine anyway. Just needed to get this off my chest. Stuck,Depression
7896,Hi allThe last few years have been awful to me. Although I am 19 and at a very good university life is so tough right now. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago not because of any external factors but just because me lmao. My family has always been fine and we are close and supportive and my friend groups over the years know what is happened.The past 4 summers however have been awful and I am losing everyone I love.3 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown over my thoughts spiralling and nearly committed suicide. I did not tell any friends about this and was too mentally exhausted to socialise over most of the summer and I lost many friends by just not seeing them.2 years ago I broke up with my girlfriend. It was sad as any breakup is but was made worse by false rumours she had made about me. We broke up just entering into summer break and that summer was really tough. I worked on myself over summer but I became very anxious about what everyone thought about me and I lost a lot of my humour.Last year of course covid hit so we were in lockdown which was isolating. Just to add fire to my already depreciating mental state my dad was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April. Thankfully that is one of the safer cancers to have but I would not ever wish the experience on anyone. Over this summer he had rounds of radiotherapy and scans and it was so stressful. I joined uni later this year and although I made a fair few friends my dad was always on my mind and I could not enjoy myself as much.This summer I have been framed for a completely horrid allegation and the investigation process is so painful and mentally exhausting. I am trying my hardest to stay positive but it has taken away my social battery completely and once again summer has not been kind to me. To add to this my dad had gotten a recurrence on his cancer and his voice box had to be taken out and he was in hospital for 2 months recoveringHas anyone else had years of just horrible stuff happen and what advice can you give to try and get through all of this. Also what professional help do you think would be appropriate I have tried antidepressants but i did not like them Sorry for the long read but thanks How do you look past all of the bad things life gives you,Depression
8484,Recently my boyfriends ex threatened suicide and the wave of emotions that washed over me was almost too much. I grew up in a very abusive household where my sister and I were both physically beat and emotionally abused. I had the added bonus of being sexually abused. From a very young age we learned to fear our father and his moods. I can recall my mom attempting suicide multiple times when I was growing up. I can vividly remember seeing her in the shower with her clothes still on and my dad trying to get her to throw up.Ill never forget the nights my sister had to spend in the hospital after her attempt she came very close to succeeding. My attempt was much more low key but it was there. Thank god my best friend told a school counselor he literally saved my life. Of course therapy was never an option we had to maintain the appearance of a happy family no one could know what went on behind closed doors. I am not sure where I am going with this. All these images and memories keep popping up in my head. I thought I had dealt with the trauma that was my younger years already. I guess my therapist and I still have work to do. All the women in my family have attempted suicide,Depression
8827,No one will probably read this but I just wanted to say I am sorry. I am sorry to YOU reading this for wasting your time I am sorry to my two little siblings who I do not talk to I am sorry mom for being a piece of shit son I am sorry dad for not calling you and neglecting our relationship I am sorry to all my cousin's who I have ignored like an asshole. MOST IMPORTANTLY I am sorry for being alive and causing all this suffering. I have let you all down. I hate myself as much as everyone else hates me. I am sorry for being alive.,Depression
7863,I do not want to be dead I just do not want to live in this world. I love being conscious and being able to experience existence but this world has thrown nothing but pain at me time and time again. Life here is so mundane and unfulfilling. Its such a sick joke. I wish I did not have to waste away here. I want the freedom to live a life that I was meant to one that does not have to be perfect but is fulfilling at the very least. I am constantly thinking that if I die here maybe Ill be able to start anew in a different world. But there is no way for me to know. I might just cease to exist. As sucky as that may be I can accept it since my pain will end along with me. But I do not know it its worth putting my family and friends through such a heavy loss. I do not want to fade away. I do not want to stop existing. But I also do not want to stay here. I wish I could just go where I was meant to go. I want to live a life of my own image. Please. Someone help me. Repost because I need help I do not want to cease to exist. I just want a new life.,Depression
7324,Burner account for obvious reasons.It is so hard to have to seem like I am alright 247. Nobody asks me how I am doing. Nobody reaches out to me first. I could go days without meaningful conversation. My childhood was beyond fucked up. My father killed himself and my mother became addicted to drugs. My siblings and I were neglected. I was molested by another kid in the foster home that I stayed at for 2 months and told nobody because I was ashamed that it happened to me as a male. My siblings and I stayed with our single grandmother for 2 grueling years until she could not take care of 4 children anymore. She sent my two sisters back into foster care and for that I cannot blame her. I never got to say goodbye so I feel like they died and there were suddenly less people who truly understood what I have gone through.I finished my last year of middle school and all of high school constantly hiding my depression. Some days are fine and other days are miserable. However I never let it show how hopeless I was. When my grandmother and I would fight over the smallest things she took me to therapy for a few weeks of my junior year. She thought I had anger issues but I truly do not so I got diagnosed with an undeclared mood disorder. I just did not want to open up too random stranger about anything. My uncle asked me once in my freshman or sophomore year of high school if I was depressed and I lied and said no. I have not opened up to anyone because as a male people are uncomfortable when we show vulnerability. I hate crying in front of others.COVID robbed me of the rest of my senior year of high school. I lost connection with the friends I was making and some of the friends I had. I have never felt more alone in life now than ever. I cannot remember the last time I left the house to spend time with friends. If I stop reaching out nobody will bother to check and see how I am doing. I live a meaningless life and I am expected to suck it up and work a full time job that I dislike very much. I am uncertain of what career path will help me most in my future. My grandmother ensures me that my time at her home is very limited and that it is not a safety net. I am very sure that I will end up killing myself in the near future. My brother already has bipolar depression so I am worried that if I end my life he will suffer. I know that everyone else that has been in my life will forget about me soon after. They probably hate how closed off I am but the primary reason I close myself off is to spare them from the pessimism that I keep inside me day to day. I am not going to burden other people with my suffering. So since I am I coward who cannot kill himself enjoy the vague depressing haha essay that I typed. I just wanted to get this out here so I feel less alone. do not reach out to me to tell me it gets better. Its a shallow phrase used by people lucky enough to have had people who care enter their life. Good for you. I might never come to check if my post was recognized because I really do not care. I just wanted to vent.Sorry for being self centered here. Sorry if some things made no sense.Sorry for wasting your time.I will not end my life anytime soon but later most likely. I am 19 and already very tired. Thanks for reading I am going to off myself as soon as I get the courage.,Depression
7668,I am not depressed or at least I do not think I am in an episode.I just feel so fucking dead inside.I feel so apathetic about literally everything.I cannot sleep well because I lost my job and I do not do anything physically during the day anymore. I do not want to look for new jobs because job hunting is trash.I start college in the fall so even if i do find a job I will only be able to work a little.Parents are in my ass about college enrollment when I am doing my best. I do not care about spending my life on anything better then quick little bursts of dopamine like videogames weed sex internet and memes.I do not care if I live for tomorrow or die right this minute I could not care for a single heartbeat.The only thing that keeps me alright is my boyfriend but too much of that is unhealthy too and I would die before I ruin this relationship.Just so fucking dead inside. Feeling dead inside Rant,Depression
8586,My GF suffers from bad depression. She had become very distant and to me it felt like she was pushing me away. She started a new job and went really quiet. I took it as she had lost interest in me and I broke up with her. She could not seem to make time for me and I left for a trip and we had very little contact after I left. It seemed to me that she had no interest in having a conversation with me. She said that she thought I needed space but idk why she would of thought that. She had became distant months ago and became more so as time passed. I am curious to know if this could be normal behavior of someone who is feeling overwhelmed and is moving through depression. All I wanted was to be there for her and to feel that she still cared. Once it felt like she did not care anymore I could not do it any longer. I was very patient with her and would let her initiate any plans to hang out My GF was moving through a bad time of depression,Depression
8400,Most of us were born out of wedlock. Growing up with a lack of basic needs that are not tended to and even those who were planned still end up having a shitty life! Outside of that we have society on our necks about being happy chasing dreams when in reality people are struggling to just live! Homelessness is high drug and alcohol addiction is high suicide rates are rapidly rising. I will never bring a being into this shithole we call life. Humans are self centered and delusional end of story!!!!! No wonder there are so many addicts in the world. No wonder suicide rates are skyrocketing. No wonder this world is full of chaos and misery.,Depression
7720,I have been trying to hold out on suicide for 4 years now and last night I remembered something horrible I did and broke down and lost it. The thought of it scars me and the people I hurt do not believe me when I genuinely say I am sorry either. Piled with the suicidal thoughts I have daily and family conflict was just too much.The only reason I am still here is because of my family and the friends who have not ghosted me out of concern for them. They cried begging me not to go and just hearing them like that is the only reason I have not tried again yet they do not know how much it hurts hearing them say that.I really do not think it will get better and wished I was never born so everyone could be so much happier. I do not understand how people feel I deserve life when all I am is a waste of time and resources. I wish I never existed,Depression
7295,There is someone very close to me with depression and i have no idea how to respond when they vent to me I have never been good with handling other peoples feelings and I do not want them to think I am dismissing their feelings I really do care about them and I feel bad when they trust me enough to vent and I am just speechless. Any help is appreciated! How do I comfort someone when they vent to me?,Depression
7666,that is pretty much it I have slowly stopped eating less per day how should I overcome this ? I am not eating enough,Depression
8304,I feel like I have tried everything.I am 22 I have a wonderful 8 month old daughter I completed my Bachelors degree in 2 years I work at my dream job in a level one trauma center as a Trauma RN I own my own home and paid off vehicle. I am fairly healthy I gained some weight during my pregnancy but before and even the past 2 months I eat pretty well count macros workout 46 days a week. I have tried so many medications therapies psychiatrists psychologists. They all say I am improving but in reality I just shut down every time I go. I am tired of feeling the same way day in and day out and hearing the same crap. I feel like I do not get anything helpful that actually changes my life. I do not have many close friends or people that I enjoy being around I feel exhausted after my days of working or having lunch with a friend that may only even last an hour. I have tried the fake it 'till you make it bull crap positive mindset yoga everything. I feel like my mind is a black cloud that chokes out every happy moment or thought.I kept telling myself when I was in middle and high school that this would be it when I finally achieved what I wanted to and had my dream life maybe I could get stable ground and not feel like I am running away from my own thoughts 247. I am sick of being depressed. It is robbing me of my life. My daughter is 8 months and I cannot help but cry every time I think too much about it I feel bad because half of the time all I can do it put on a show for her and scroll through my phone or sleep. She is everything to me and I feel like a terrible parent. I cannot take it anymore I do not know what to do. Am I ever going to be happy?,Depression
7575,As of lately it feels like my life has been so stagnant and I have never felt so alone. I am currently studying a career but I do not even know if I truly love it.. just a interest I picked up. Ever since I graduated high school my life has been so difficult.. I am supposed to start work soon but its not amazing. I just do not know what my end goal is anymore. I thought I did and it felt great and I was motivated but now its whatever. I have no family I mean I do but we are not bonded together and I do not feel comfort and constant connection like its symbiotic. I have not had any friends for over 2 years just meet and greets here and there. My father passed away when I was 3 and I truly believe he was the only person that was outgoing and engaging and would have never let me feel alone. I mean I have invested in certain things but its not enough. what I want is adventure and for everyone in bad situations to be free as well. where the fuck is the unity in todays world? we are all one race and it does not feel like it. its to yourself work make money be selfish and that is it. It fucking sucks. I do not even know what i am doing anymore.,Depression
8793,I was looking at some past friends social media and it made me realize even more how sad and pathetic my life really is. And yes before anyone says it I know social media is not real and only shows people the good sides and blah blah blah but still its clear these people are at least doing something in there life and trying to go after their dreams while I am just laying in bed..doing absolutely nothing for the past 4 years. Also I have no friends. I still really do not know why I have absolutely no friends like there are people who are absolutely shit and have tons of friends but I do not. At this point after this many years I have come to the conclusion I am just unlikeable for some reason. And I SWEAR to fucking GODDDD if someone tries to give me some advice on how to make friends. Trust me when I say I have done everything you possibly could to make friends. At this point I have given up and have decided to be friendless forever. Even if somehow someone all of a sudden wanted to be friends with me Id turn them down because Id be too pissed off that for some reason now that I do not give a shit about being alone now someone is trying to befriend me Id be mad. I am so behind in life,Depression
7008,I am only 21. But everyone around me just tells me that I always act so serious and sometimes even dress too conservatively for my age. It.. honestly hurts my feelings. I grew up in an environment where I had so much pressure put on to me to take abuse and not complain about it and learn to do everything on my own. I am not claiming to be more mature then people my own age but I am just tired of people making fun of me for not being more fun idk it seems something dumb to complain about but it just makes me feel sad today. I get told I act and look like an old person,Depression
7283,Okay I do not know where to start and it is going to be pretty unorganised. And I cannot completely express myself so most of it is going to end up in my mind again ig I not sure.I am introvert antisocial athiest logical etc and this personality was not expected by my parents and people around me. they always have been forcing me to change my personality. I want to explain them so hard and with that rage you know so that they feel it ig that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday shouting and wasting your time just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that people here all neighbours judge a lot and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted and I have to pretend which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you I do not want to talk to you but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made how stupidly wrong they were it is not like I am correct but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic sexist illogical and it is also about me sometimes which are generally misleading and wrong even of my parents they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have which might have will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home even in school I am so shy I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind how hard is it? Damn it is hard for me and I am not sure why everytime I take a long breath to talk I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight. So most of the times I am like I cannot do anything now I do not care I will just move on but at night I realise how it is going to affect my life and I am like why did not I do that why did not I say that and get depressed everytime. I am sure that I am going to struggle my entire life and end up destroying opportunities and just imagine how my life would have been better. I am lonely never been in a relationship and have few online friends which is another source of depression and there are more things . Sorry if I have been just repeating topics also it was not as interesting and thank you if you read all of this . Idk why am I sharing this idc about upvotes It is just like when I am explaining about how wrong people were about the concepts to myself which does makes me somewhat happy ig but I end up in depression again bc that is not going to happen. It always ends up in my mind.,Depression
7566,I do not want to work I do not want to force myself to try things to find something I like I do not want to socialize with random people I do not even want to watch tv or play video games. I do not want anything in this life there is nothing here for me to want or bother pursuing. The world is ugly uncaring and cruel it will not let me find happiness whether I try or not. I am done with it. I just do not want this,Depression
7524,Hi hoping this will make me feel better. This summer has been hard. I am medicated for anxietydepression have a partner I love and that is so supportive a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll especially since COVID its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic providerprovide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous anxious patients in pain and I feel like a sponge all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care nothing ishas ever been worth the copay. I used to want to have kids to give them the happy childhood I did not have but why add another burden to the planet. The future is not sustainable. Country is legit on fire nature is dying. Basic truths or facts do not matter anymorejust stupid ass culture wars to bring in ratings and profit. I remember thinking the first time I wanted to die was when I was 8. Thought Id definitely be dead before college so why worry about that. Then oh once I achieve x y and z it will get better. It has to! How can humanity have gone this long if this is the reality? Yet here we are. Cool Existential dreadusa,Depression
8632,I am an extremely introverted homosexual boy of 18 living in an extremely homophobic judgemental society where gays are subjected to be killed if they ever come out so I basically have no future other than living a lie in fear hiding my feelings forever and never getting to love in my entire life. I used to be a very bright student who scored all A grades during my secondary education but ever since I started my high school my grades have been drastically dropping because I am depressed all the time. I come from a big family with a history of bright minds and all my cousins siblings and peers are all extremely well performing meanwhile I am being a disgrace to my family. The pressure on me is immeasurable. I basically have no other talents I have a weak skinny body and I am not at all good at any sports either. In my attempts to search for something I am good at and as an attempt to hide my sexuality I started going for basketball practice with some boys because I found the game compelling but only felt a burden to them and the only one who did not show any improvement in months so I quit it. I do not even know what my career would be and what to try for even if I considered to live an unmarried life which is again risky because I will be constantly judged. My social life is also non existent because I have just 23 friends who I talk to and not one of them is close enough for me to share any of these with. I tend to distant everyone because I fear they will know my truth. I am also very insecure about my looks and my body so I have ceased to go out whatsoever unless necessary. I was also bullied back then at my hometown for having a feminine attitude until I got extremely sick and my family had to move to the city for better treatment for me and ever since I have refused to return to my hometown even for a vacation. That said I am also a sick person with a weak immune system and my family pays too much for my health care for my studies etc and I do not think any of it is worth it. I also recently did a huge mistake which is dating a girl who confessed to me as an opportunity to changehide my sexuality or in case someone is suspecting I was gay only to hurt her due to lack of affection from me. I could not bear hurting her anymore so I broke up with her but could not give a good reason for it and it turns out she still loves me to this day and is constantly getting hurt. My siblings parents have no idea what I am going through and often mocks me and jokingly comments on how I am good for nothing not like other boys ugly etc. So I often avoid interacting with them either and isolate myself in the room for most of the time of the day. In short I am an ugly goodfornothing living a lie in fear with no future yet with a lot of pressure on me. Thanks for reading. I did not have anyone to share this with,Depression
8975,I have gained an insane amount of weight while being depressed. More than 40 pounds. it is devastating and keeps me more depressed. If I take lexapro for my depression and anxiety will it make me gain more weight or will I be happier and not want food as much and lose weight? Depression and overheating,Depression
8333,Hello thank you for reading this first of all.I wonder if anyone here is feeling or has felt the way I do and has found a way to resolve it.Anyway long story short I was always an underdog in primary school high school everywhere I went I was the punching bag I also had bad grades. I was terribly depressed and suicidal all childhoold which is not the issue here but I feel like it is related to this post. I am an elementary school teacher now I am also just graduating from university I think I am not doing so badly. However since my GF left me I feel like I am going downhill again. I am obsessed with improving myself studying just overall bettering myself at anything. I feel like I am just not good enough for anyone. Ever since she left me it is getting worse. it is like there is this voice in my head that says I am stupid and useless and there is no way to turn it off. It has been getting worse lately. I just do not know what to do. My mind has this idea that during the last year I was procrastinating too much and was not studying enough and is making me feel really terrible. Honestly I do not know. My mind is blurred. I feel like I am going insane. ampx200BI have never been to a psychologist nor will I ever go. I just want the voice to stop. Any tips? Lol. I feel insane just posting this. How to forgive myself for feeling not good enough?,Depression
7084,I cannot operate the way I should in society. I try to fool myself I suppose. But I cannot be like other people I have been this way for so long and I cannot see the line between you and me.I am too far gone. I am not even sure I even really want it. Then why am I even trying? I know I cannot hold up this stupid persona you want me to have. I cannot justify just chasing stupid things in my head. I do not care about your money I do not care about your rules I just want mine and I want you out of my way. I wish I had the means to retaliate I really do. Teach people that it is not ok to take regardless of how powerful you think you are.My therapist says it sounds like a threat. If I had the means it would not be a threat. It would be inevitable. You force your will on me steal from me you pay the price.But as it stands I have no method to force you to pay. So I just sit and waste away. Why would I want anything to do with your stupid little game? When I would rather blow off your face I do not think I can,Depression
8111,I am lonely I made that very clear to her. An Acquaintance texted me an all of a sudden I am not lonely anymore she thinks she knows me so well but she has never met the real me. I have the biggest hopes and dreams and I do not feel like I can achieve them they are starting to fade away just like my personality. I know this is all over the place. But please send help. My mom downplays my depression,Depression
8195,I was diagnosed with a thyroid tumor about 2 years ago but stopped showing up at the hospital soon after. I am 21 now. have not told about it to my parents yet because I do not want to be a burden even though I know they deserve the truth.I have been horribly ashamed of my life decisions since I was around 17 or even earlier.I work at a dead end job and the only reason I show up is out of fear of having to move back in with my parents They did make some questionable choices when I was growing up but out of love for meI am still in love with a girl I never told about my feelings.Probably just the idea of her but it is hard to tellI make plans but never follow through.I let some of my friends to take advantage of me as I rarely stand up for myself.I have done a lot of drugs to hide the pain and forget about my mistakes and regrets.The only time I am honest is when I am drunk or high Except right now I guess which is weird...I do have dreams and aspirations though but I set myself such high standards that It makes me paralyzed.No matter how many selfhelp books I read or selfreflection I do I am still unable to ask for help. But I really do want help. Help me. Please just help me?Help!Tldr I am a procrastinating hypocriteIt does feel great to write this even if I do not end up posting it. Sorry for my language skills I am not a native.Ps. Go get vaccinated please I will not probably make it but you might and the next waves that come will kill the economy. Or maybe it deserves to die before it can be rebuilt on some better foundations. The only thing I am not procrastinating with is living,Depression
7933,Its been years I tried everything and just when I thought I had gotten it slightly into control with a good job a great family and loved ones and even a better body. I still feel sad and I am ashamed of myself feeling this way because I have got almost everything. Why do I still feel so empty. I am back here and somehow I feel ashamed of being sad,Depression
8501,I am here all alone and nobody seems to care that I am sad everyday. I just want someone to talk to,Depression
8970,Finally fucking did it. 20 years old almost a millionaire in liquid cash assets passive income of 5 figures monthly bought my parents a home in cash as gift why the fuck am I not happy?I do not fucking understand I always wanted this I always worked for it now I have it and my brain still tells me to fucking die.I cannot possibly explain this and I am aware of how stupid it sounds but I cannot help it.I avoid mirrors just so I do not have to look at myself. My brain cannot be helped. Anything good I do it tells me its worthless because I could have done it sooner but now its too late.Become wealthy? you are 20 should have achieved that at max 18.Create beautiful successful projects? Meh there are teens building the future since they are 12 you are too late.Anything I do its not good enough.I do not expect kind comments or any comments at all I just wanted to pour my soul out to somebody.I am hanging by a thread and nobody sees it. I finally fucking did it but I still feel the need to die,Depression
7146,I am pethicic for a 25 year old. All I know how to do in this world is play video games and watch tv.,Depression
7796,I want to die but i feel like other people have it worse than me.It just hit me that people have a reason to die. Usually life's been shit for them family problems and many more.Me? Well life has been steady. It is not as bad as others'. But i still want to die. I must be really ungrateful. I must have been overreacting. I am so confused right now. Do i really want to die? I want to die. I am bored. I am lonely. What to do? What to do..... I want to die but...,Depression
8615,I literally just want to say to my family that I am depressed I have been wanting to kill myself like I just want to say this why does my brain just does not want to do it why cannot I just fuckijg do It the closest thing I did was texting I kind of want to kill myself lol to my bestfriend and it took me like an hour to decide if I should send it or not I want help but I cannot ask for it why am I like this Why cannot I just ask for help,Depression
8482,It has become nearly impossible for me to relate to the normal things that orher people have and take for granted everyday. I do not feel human anymore because I cannot relate to or connect with anything that people say anymore. All I see is everyone elee living their lives while I have been stuck in the same position for years with no help. Whenever I see a couple togerher it really effects me because I have never had anything like that and I realized that other people do not care what you are goinf through as long as they feel good they are content to ignore you. I am almost 29 now and I have never been in a real relationship in my life. People have always treated me differently. I watched as the years went by and everyone else in my family found a partner and got married. While other people found love I was here alone and I still am. This entire situation has had a terrible impact on my mental state. These days all I find myself doing is wasting the road at it my limited time and sleeping. When everyone else talks about their interests and hobbies all I can think of is oh that is nice I wish I could afford to go out and do fun things. But since I do not have any money I can only have hobbies that are free such as writing and reading. It saddens me to no end how other people are held above us and used as a form of social capital. Its unreal how much those in power have completely ruined the natural interactions that humans used to have. Almost every single way that people interact these days is twisted and unnatural. Humans were never meant to live this way but for some reason we continue to day after day much to our own dismay. Sometimes I feel this world is nothing but a nightmare when I think about the past and how people used to act. People were not always this way but they act like there is no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years. I used to be a sensitive person who felt a range of emotions and I used to be able to get excited about things. Now I feel like a broken person I do not feel much anymore except extreme despair and sadness which eventually feels like nothing after a while. It is great how everyone else gets to continue to live their lives and experience all these things that people take for granted while my life declines and gets worse everyday. Every day just gets worse for me. cannot relate to others anymore,Depression
8346,I do not want to have a job. I do not want to shower. I do not want to clean my room. I do not want to exercise. I do not want to do almost everything. Why? Because I am not masochist that is why.I also do not have anhedonia. Everything is boring because it is. Do you mean I could just play the same game for eternity without getting bored? Get real.I do not like life I do not have any hobbies and I have my reasons. People should stop telling me I am depressed and that I should see a therapist. do not guilttrip me. there is nothing wrong with me. Accept different opinions. I do not have depression.,Depression
8449,As the post title suggests I am always in physical pain due to stress and depression. I have ended up in the ER multiple times due to random chest pain and sometimes backache. Sometimes my shoulders and neck start hurting and sometimes it is a headache BUT every time my doc physician not psychiatrist says there is nothing wrong with my body and if I stopped worrying so much my symptoms will lessen. I am always in physical pain due to depression,Depression
8040,I used to cry every single day. But now my self esteem is higher and I am actually kind of enjoying life a lot more. However i still lack motivation to do the things i love or get out of the house. I do not feel sad anymore i just lack motivation,Depression
8857,so this might be a little long. sorry about that in advance anyway.like the title said I have no idea what I am doing with my life not trying to feel sorry for myself by posting this or anything I just do not know what to do anymore. I had a very complicated childhood my parents never let me get an education. and by that I mean not at all I never did any school work or even went to school at all when I was a kidteen.my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it using a mix of autocorrectgoogle translate to write this out and my math is awful but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someonewent outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me and some of them even used to tell me that I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway.the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education do not have any friends I cannot get a job and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon. I do not think it will help me much honestly. I wake up every day scared of being homeless I cannot relax anymore I do not enjoy anything in life anymore. for anyone who is worried I do not think I am suicidal but I am honestly finding it hard to find a reason to live anymore.to anyone who made it to the end of this probably very badly spelled post Thank you. I feel like I am floating through life and I do not know what to do anymore.,Depression
8285,Please can you give me some advice on how to help my long distance partner through a deep depression. He is telling me that he wants to give up on everything and I am extremely worried about him. He thinks that he is holding me back and that he is not good for me and he admitted that he was considering breaking up with me because of this. But I can clearly see that this is not he wants and he is just hurting himself by doing so. He also admitted he is trying to push me away because he is hurting me but will not communicate with me about what hes going through or how he feels.I have tried as many things as I can think of listeningbeing here for him suggested doctor visits for trying medscounselling mindfulness suggested exercises and to meet up with friends and family. there is more but that is some examples. Despite this he continues to tell me that he wants to give up on himself and keeps saying that we should not be together quoting I wish things were easier I wish things did not mess up the way it did. But I just want to let you go because you do not deserve any of that and I will keep hurting you if we keep going But I am 100 sure that he does not want to give up on us and that he is just so deep in his depression right now that he cannot see a way out so hes pushing me away to because me less hurt but its actually hurting me way more to know hes thinking about leaving me. I am sorry for all of the text but I just wanted to get some advice from outsiders. Obviously there is more to it than this but I do not want to write a whole novel hahah. So please if there is anything you can think of then let me know because I really do not want to lose this man we are so good for each other and I want to support him through what hes experiencing right now so we can be in each others arms again.Some extra context my boyfriend is 24 and I am 21. We have been together for over 3 years now and do not often arguefall out. He has been struggling with undiagnosed depression for over a year now. Following this he recently found out that a family member has been diagnosed with cancer which he is understandably struggling with. We were also supposed to be moving in together within the next month but I can tell he is struggling from the pressure of finding a place. In the past two weeks we took a 1 week break of not talking to each other to try and reflect on things. We both found this extremely difficult and are now suffering because of it. Yesterday he told me he was considering breaking up with me during the break which was a huge shock to also he has never said anything like this to me before. I just do not want to lose him and wish he could realise that breaking up is really not the right choice. He is not thinking straight right now and I just want to help him but I do not know how.Thanks so much in advance Need advice on helping my ldr partner through depression,Depression
7374,My life has already been a nightmare of trauma amp I finally got to a safe place. I owe my security deposit amp the past month has been hell. Hit with an intense wave of fatigue and anxiety for the first week then a concussion amp car problems I rely on my car for work amp then tried to end my life and just ended up in the hospital amp psychward for a week. Been trying to catch up on my bills but its been impossible and just adding to the anxiety. I am terrified I am going to lose the only safe place I have ever had in my life because of all this. I am so fucking broke I could end it,Depression
7346,I do not have anyone to talk to in person at least no one I feel close to. Sometimes whenever I am walking somewhere sitting down laying down or driving I imagine I am having a conversation with someone right next to me. I imagine that someone is there that i trust that is listening to all I have to say concerning my thoughts feeling and other things I am too embarrassed to talk about. I am imagining a scenario where I actually have someone in person to talk to and when the conversation ends I look around I see no one near me and I cry. Conversing with yourself,Depression

8382,No good vibes here. I am not actually angry with you I just do not know how to express this empty only existing feeling to you mom. I am doing shitty.,Depression
8182,I am not sure if anyone here has felt this way but I feel a sort of existential depression that is not a result of lacking or wanting things. On the surface I feel like I have everything that anyone could ever want. I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes have a loving family friends and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager. Even in grade school I exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless I still feel this gargantuan intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life. Even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant I would feel nothing but the phantom pain. I am bound to this worthless body and by the obligations I have towards the people in my life and I cannot even fathom them ever understanding my plight. No one will. I am trapped. An outlet for my personal feelings.,Depression
8001,I want to commit suicide I really wish I could do it without hurting the people around me. I want to quit,Depression
8337,Just venting. Grew up without father. Mother was insane. She finaly died when I was in my 20s. I have nothing. I am close to 35 years old. Nothing to show for it. do not have a drivers lisense no girlfriend. Nothing.I do not feel emotions anymore. Only way I can feel emotion is to drink heavily and when I do only anger shows.. at least that is something.I have started hitting myself hard in the headface in conjunction with being drunk. This gives me a sort of calm feeling I like. Currently I am red in my face from hitting myself and it feels so good. Rant over I have started hitting myself. 30 years of pain and I need relief.,Depression
8194,My parents admitted me to a hospital because they assumed I was going through a nervous breakdown. I had to stay there for a week and it was hell. My stay at the hospital triggered a psychotic episode. They would pin me down and give me an injection in my buttcheek. They saw me naked and they were also physically aggressive. The body language of the male staff was very threatening and triggered a lot of paranoia in me. They also gave me so many pills. I feel like my brain has become mush now. I genuinely do not want to live anymore I lost any positive trait I had left. I have been crying non stop now. I feel like I am doomed for eternity and there is nothing left for me in this world. I feel like the only good trait I had was my intelligence but now it is gone due to all the drugs I was given. I have not even graduated high school yet My stay at a hospital made me worse,Depression
8707,I am a boy in my family .My brother is in college and my father and sister is working away from home.They can go home because of covid.I live with my mom and sister at home.So i need to do a lot of work because I am the only male at home.We have cats.I do not like cat.I always ask to give them away but my family do not want to.The worst thing is i need to take care of the cats such as give them foods and clean their sandbox.It makes me so angry.Anything i can do?Please help me.I keep this thing for so long. I am stress please help me,Depression
7867,Help only works for those who help themselves. I think I am just not cut out for the life. I think I had enough. I am just inherently incapable of doing anything in life. I want to sleep forever. Sleep is the only thing that does not hurt. Except that every second of being hurts. I always try to fight it back and remain optimistic. But I think this is the time. This is the feeling. it is a signal from Universe to me this feeling. That I am a mistake and I deserve nothing. Because I just cannot put efforts in anything now. I feel ashamed that I do not even have courage to end my life. Maybe this is my fate to just suffer. Suffer endlessly without any ability to stop this suffering. At most I can distract myself from this misery by sleeping. But even that seems to be out of control. I can only sleep when I can sleep. Hope I made any sense atleast. Help will not work,Depression
7024,I no longer look forward to ANYTHING. I have a beautiful girlfriend a caring family job opportunities talent looks personality but inside I am miserable and have lost my love for life. I spent about 3 years of my life going through all the popular antidepressants benzodiazepines etc. but none of them worked. I no longer drink alcohol because I abuse it and I no longer smoke weed because when I do I smoke nonstop and get even more depressed. I am at the end of my rope and I no longer know what to do. I am not going to commit suicide but I just wish I could find some hope. Any suggestions would be appreciated I am 27 m amp Everything in my life is picture perfect from the outside but my depression is eating me up inside day by day.,Depression

51498,Im mostly so avoidant due to being ashamed of my appearance and feeling like I dont belong. Anyone else feel the same way? Im a below average looking guy and I just want to be normal looking. I feel like my AVPD has gotten worse over time because I am just too ugly for life.,Personality-disorder
51091,Not afraid of rejections but about others mocking me for my feelings can anybody relate? I dont think i am afraid of the rejection but about two other things First one is that other guys could mock me for my feelings and use this against me.And second is that if she does get to know me better she might loose interest as i am just not really good at this dating thing. Can you relate to that?,Personality-disorder
50972,Anyone else move a lot during childhood? In 6th grade I moved to another state for about 6 months then I moved back to where I was up until my first or second year of highschool and then I moved again. I feel like this might be what cemented my social stagnation. I pretty much ghosted everyone I knew and every time I thought I was putting roots down I had to relocate. although I didn't really have many friends but it still hurt Because my mother didn't want anyone to know we were moving I just had to vanish. After losing friends and not having a stable environment I think I pretty much gave up and have been a homebodyshutin ever since. I wonder if this could contribute to AvPD I'm not officially diagnosed yet by the way.,Personality-disorder
50582,Anyone else lie as a child? Not sure if its an AVPD thing but growing up I told a string of lies to all of my very few friends. It weighs on me almost daily. Some were really horrible like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. Of course thats not real. I cant believe I said those things to people but it felt like the only way at the time.Through a lot of reflection I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person because I didnt deserve them. But nothing in my life that I understood at the time was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if youre not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge its not a valid mental health condition. I didnt think I had any reason to have the problems I did so I had to give people fake reasons to make them believe it because my parents told me thats the only way.Also somewhat of a test like if they stay for this horrible person Im pretending to be theyll surely stick around for who I actually am if thats better. And its not hard to be better than that given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave then Ill have been in control of the rejection. And theyre not reacting to the true me anyway so the judgement doesnt hurt as badly. Avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person.,Personality-disorder
51421,Anyone else terrified of dying alone? finally found the will to post here after years of lurkingIve been living alone for all my adult years and I work from home. I dont have any kind of social life and can easily spend several weeks without seeing or speaking to anyone. I do have family but they all live far away and I dont see them often.So sometimes I cant help but wonder what would happen if I ever have a stroke or a heart attack or if I fall down the stairs or if I choke on some food I often read about people being found dead in their home several years or even decades after they died and deep down Im convinced thats how Ill end up. It really makes me feel scared and helpless and I dont know how to cope with it.,Personality-disorder
51318,How to know if it's social anxiety or AvPD ? I think I have social anxiety no official diagnosis because getting any kind of official diagnosis is difficult here but it's fairly obvious and several mental health professionals I've seen acknowledged it but I recognise myself a lot in the symptoms of AvPD. I tried looking online what the exact difference between social anxiety and AvPD but I didn't really find anything useful or well explained enough. This disorder seems fairly unknown to me and I'm struggling to find ressources. How do you know it's AvPD and not social anxiety? Is there any good ressources books YouTube channel website... on this topic that you would recommend. Is it okay for me self diagnose?,Personality-disorder
51515,is it only me? i've been diagnosed having BPD borderline personality disorder 4 years ago when i was 16 since then my life have been a living hell. However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot though i still have all the BPD symptoms some symptoms like avoidance social anxiety isolation feeling less came up from nowhere. For matter of fact i stopped talking to all my friends stopped working going out date i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement and if it wasn't for my mother i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden. Sometimes i think i might be paranoid but i don't think people wan't me any harm nor i feel persecuted i'm just ashamed of myself... I don't know if i have AvPD or just social anxiety but it's a fucking misery..Is there anyone if this situation?,Personality-disorder
51555,HopelessnessToo lateness Is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything? Too late to try too late to get treatment too late for anything and everything? Too old? Or if someone is too badly off? I've seen some people around Reddit and the net refer to failed lives. I've recently made posts and tried to look around Reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be nobody. And the only conclusion I can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up. And AvPD along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess. Growing up or developing AvPD in a family full of NPD didn't help.Most subs seem to skew younger which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive. How has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness? Feeling too old and that it's too late to change anything satisfactorily? Does anyone have other issuesdiagnoses that mix with AvPD to just make things impossible?,Personality-disorder
50905,The Reset We All Need Hypnosis Perhaps? I was wondering if perhaps anyone has had any experience with effective hypnosis in getting over a certain fear or habit. It occurred to me that perhaps this may be more effective than traditional therapy for AVPD,Personality-disorder
50662,what avoidance feels like to me i'm not diagnosed but i always thought there was something deeply wrong with me. i've never kept a friend longer than a couple years. i'm in my second year of college and i have been at zero since covid happened. i've transferred schools so new place and new people and i'm more isolated than before.it feels like i'm not human because i'm unable to do the human thing and communicate. like i'm watching and observing but as an alien or a void or something that looks human but if you look to closely its all distorted. or robotic even. someone's failed attempt at a human being.all i do is lay in bed and ruminate over every bad interaction with past friends and family or think about how my roommates or classmates perceive me. fake conversations justifying my actions to absolutely no one. it feels like i'm going insane. i thought it was just social anxiety but i don't get panic attacks. and my reluctance and inability feels wired directly into my veins every fiber of my being and it feels like it can't be undone. like my entire identity is wrapped up in being alone. and that's all i'll ever be.,Personality-disorder
51105,How old is everyone here? Just out of curiosity I wonder what age groups are most prominent on this sub. 019 2029 3039 4049 50 and up.I cant help but wonder if this age of technology caused this disorder to become so prominent. People seem to have lost the ability or have never learned how to socialize with our faces buried into a phone computer game etc.Nobody communicates in person like in the past when people were forced to. If there was a function you had to show up to find out who was there. Maybe Im wrong but Im curious. It just feels like technology has sadly created a world of introverts or has contributed to it. Anyone agree? ,Personality-disorder
51153,Boyfriend broke up with me over my AvPD I was already thinking about breaking up with him just because AvPD made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didnt necessarily do anything wrong but its still gutwrenching. Im not necessarily heartbroken I just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to I get you have AvPD and you cant help it but its your fault this isnt working out. He was sick of me constantly ghosting him never directly communicating or confronting him about anything and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult.I already feel guilty enough about the way AvPD makes me act without someone I thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways I ruined this for him all of which just so happen to be things I already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me. In situations like this people usually say some shit like its not you its me or go easy on you right?Not to mention one of his reasons was that I was ghosting him while I have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so I genuinely didnt have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond which feels like maybe he shouldve been a tiny bit more understanding of but in terms of the big picture I guess I understand. It still feels like shit though. Ive never been broken up with before and even though I wanted out since the week he first confessed to me I dont know if Ill be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know I was the bad boyfriend and everything I was insecure about I have every right to hate myself for.EDIT After I panicblocked him on all social media he is now anonymously harassing me on Tumblr to confront me about it and generally being very childish and kinda fucked up and creepy so. Maybe I dodged a bullet actually.,Personality-disorder
50643,Currently grieving the life Ill never have Yes Im working on myself and its never to late to startchange. But some things are time sensitive and Ill just have to accept Ill never have children for example. Sure I could pop one out right now but that wouldnt be the responsible thing to do given my mental state as well as just my general state of things.There just isnt enough time for me to get well enough get my life in order find a reasonable partner get married and start a family before time runs out. So now Im just trying to prepare myself for when the inevitable comes and Im still here left alone probably still struggling mentally.That is all Im sad this disorder has robbed me of so much and I still cant seem to get a handle on it.,Personality-disorder
51501,Making changes in a terrible depression Tw lightly suicidalThis week I have to begin fixing my life. I dont have a choice in the matter. I will need to see a new psychiatrist and a new therapist. I need to get a job I need to eat. I have so much to do to fix myself before I can even start with the basics of life. And worst of all I have to be honest to heal. Im not even honest with myself. I just smile and nod to everyone. No one takes me seriously because Im always laughing and joking. I cant turn it off. Like when your parents say keep making that face and itll stick that way forever I got my face stuck in a clown mask.I feel like a shriveled dehydrated soul. Like a sewer rat crawling out of the soggy drain. Im horrifically depressed the worst of my life. And honestly the effort just doesnt feel worth it. Id really rather just rot and die. Im so terrified of all this Id prefer to die. But I couldnt make that choice either. I am trapped on all sides.,Personality-disorder

51369,had a successful weekend I was diagnosed with AvPD a little over 2 weeks ago after knowing what it is for years and being in various stages of denial. Ive spent most of the past couple weeks just feeling shitty and hopeless but I decided to reach out to people a couple days ago went on a date yesterday and hung out with an old friend I havent seen in years and their friend for a couple hours today! I even texted a support group chat to hold me accountable even though I usually never say anythingplus my roommates had people over yesterday and while I still isolated I at least got myself to make polite conversation in passing. old habits die hard so Im not exactly expecting this to stick yet but Im proud of myself!,Personality-disorder
50727,Fried my personality I feel bad for making another post here but I just want to see if anyone has experienced this and recovered. I feel like being isolated and particularly avoidant over the last year has completely fried what little personality I had. I think a mix of depression apathy and mental anguish from little human contact has left me as this husk of a person. I was never good at connecting with people but now it seems impossible. I'm so distant and just don't have it in me to feign excitement or interest during social interactions anymore. I'm not sure how to work on things when I'm this robot with no substance to my character. It makes every attempt to speak to someone strange and awkward. It makes me feel like I have nothing to offer to another person in a conversation or interaction.,Personality-disorder

I've looked at my analytics over the past 2 years from the day I marked down as all the shit starting and I couldn't believe it.I don't even want to give the sum here because I'm ashamed. But it's a lot.

51453,My future feels so hopeless. I'm 28 years old my resume is useless haven't worked in 2 years and I am very avoidant of the world Hi there. I have been depressed since I was 12 years old. I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder afraid to leave the house by myself reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.Nothing really brings me happiness except substances and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and I've been mostly sober for a year.I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70 of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.I don't have many friends and live in a small town so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked I've tried so many treatments but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.And I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help that I don't know if I can find.Please if you can relate at all or have any advice please please respond. lt3 I'm desperate.,Personality-disorder

50805,being pretty isnt always what it seems I dont mean to sound conceited or anything but being pretty isnt all its cut out for. I know Im perceived by others as being conventionally attractive but sometimes I feel like it isolates me even more. Theres nothing but a void inside this empty shell of a person but nobody ever thinks I would feel this way because of the way I look. Nobody thinks that someone like me could hate themselves so deeply nobody thinks someone like me would need help or be this fucked up. People probably think Im a bitch in real life when they try to talk to me but I genuinely just dont know how to respond or have a genuine conversation. The answers I do give are bland and the words that come out of my mouth arent the ones I actually wanted to say. I probably come off as rude or disinterested when I dont mean to and it pushes people away because they think Im stuck up or think Im better than them. I feel like a doll trying her best to mimic the people around her. Something people like to look at sometimes but then inevitably get bored with and cast aside.Anyways sorry if this seems like Im vying for attention with this but I just wanted to give a different perspective. Lonely pretty girls are more common than you think.,Personality-disorder

50990,Anyone here feel incapable of love? Never been diagnosed with AvPD as I am too scared of asking my therapist what he thinks since by his writing he doesn't seem to care much about PD labels and I'm too afraid I will look like one of those people who tries to be cutequirkyuniquespecial by hunting for diagnoses. But I resonate a lot with the stories and thoughtsfeelings I have read from people who have AvPD and a lot of it sounds like things I have saidthoughtfelt almost word for word.I'm curious if anyone here can relate to my childhood or if I'm being overdramatic. I won't go into it too much because no one cares about my stupid sob story about why I'm a loser but I basically had a very emotionally dismissive mom it's your fault for being upset and an explosively angry father taught me it was NEVER ok to say no. Since both of them worked all day I was pretty much raised by my older halfsister who had issues of her own obviously and she would constantly bully and belittle me. My halfbrother essentially ignored me when I was growing up. I was also constantly bullied in elementarymiddle school for being weird and shy and had to see therapists that I didn't want to talk to when I was as young as 67 years old.I'm 26 years old and have never datedkissedhad sex with anyone and have never made any attempt to do so. I don't have any friends except on the internet. I used to think a partner and friends were things I wanted but thinking about it now I feel like either as a result of my upbringing or maybe some other brain failure I'm really not capable of loving anyone. I'm not even sure if I love any members of my family. I can also never be 100 comfortable in a room with someone else no matter how long I have known them for because anything that would involve me being me I would need to be alone for. Anyone relate or am I just a sociopath?,Personality-disorder
50657,HopelessnessToo lateness Is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything? Too late to try too late to get treatment too late for anything and everything? Too old? Or if someone is too badly off? I've seen some people around Reddit and the net refer to failed lives. I've recently made posts and tried to look around Reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be nobody. And the only conclusion I can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up. And AvPD along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess. Growing up or developing AvPD in a family full of NPD didn't help.Most subs seem to skew younger which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive. How has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness? Feeling too old and that it's too late to change anything satisfactorily? Does anyone have other issuesdiagnoses that mix with AvPD to just make things impossible?,Personality-disorder

50912,Relationship I started a relationship 6 months ago with a great guy both of us are in our early 20s and were friends for a while before starting the relationship. He's kind openminded respectful communicative I have no complains about him. That being said since last year mid 2022 I've had multiple problems related to my family and my mental health has gotten even worse. I have no friends and my only company is him and I dont think is healthy for him to be with someone like me I selfisolate been doing that since I was a girl don't have much time for him studiesworkfamilymental health my family doesn't support my relationships and they're capable of harming those I love they're abusive but I have no possibility of leaving home especially in my country. I barely have the energy to wake up in the morning and have spend the last years by myself without friends or a partner because of that. I'm diagnosed with depression AvPD and eating disorders and have gone to therapy with different psychologists who had different approaches for 10 years and I have took different med combinations with no success. Currently I'm not in therapy and with no medication but I'm saving money to start again in March.What should I do? I like him and I love him but I don't even have the energy to answer his messages let alone dates and be a proper partner who listens to him helps him spends time with him etc. I have told him all of this and he still wants to be with me but I feel the relationship would end up being onesided and I don't want that for him. I'm deeply ashamed of myself. Since day 1 I've cried every day and night because of that and because of the ridiculous amounts of energy I need to do anything especially things that have to do with the relationship. I've tried to change and get better I've spent so much money on therapy and meds with no results I've read dozens of selfhelp and psychology books and hundreds of papers I've tried to change my habits diet sleep more etc but I just dont know how to get better.Sorry for any grammar mistakes English isn't my first language,Personality-disorder

You just watch all these years go by one after another as you unwillingly stay alone and sabotage your relationship potential with others.

So I started looking on internet and I found lots of mental illnesses and I really felt like this one is really matching my symptoms.Now when I somehow improved my depression I see myself differently and I feel differently. I had depression my whole life without even realizing it for me having depression was a normal state sme I had no idea that there is a nondepression state.But now when my depression improved I see that some of AvPD symptoms starting disappearing and I feel better.But at this point I am just not sure I might have it and depression was making it worse.

I don't want to do them and the thought of preparing for them is absolutely exhausting partly because I feel like I have a lot to learn and even starting is hard. I just can't face it. So with that in mind I'm just avoiding my life and throwing myself into relentless scrolling on the likes of reddit and watching YouTube videos and basically becoming a robot. I'll probably cram in a load of information and ruin my sleep in the build up to the exam after wasting all this time.I don't know if it's a defence mechanism preparing for failure or what but it's fucking debilitating and I'm tired of it.,Personality-disorder
51263,I finally gathered the courage to ask for an AVPD evaluation. Just got a response in my email and I started procrastinating to not open it. I just received an email with an answer and I started freaking out and writing this message in order to delay my opening it. Could that be considered a symptom? lolNow seriously I've never even spoken about this out loud with anyone and I'm freaking out right now. Will I be able to go get tested? It's so silly but I'm afraid I will only have regular anxiety and I'll be embarrassed about making a whole deal about it.Anyway I'll put on some relaxing music and open it... at some pointEDIT so they're sending me a phone number to get in touch with them. Like seriously a voice call?? I CANNOT.EDIT 2 It just occurred to me what if it's a test already? I doubt it but I'm really surprised they asked a possible AVPD person to make a phone call.EDIT 3 I just texted this woman and told her If you don't mind it's more comfortable for me to speak this way. Then she texted me back I'm on the subway now I'll call you asap. facepalm I really need help but I'm starting to regret it right now.EDIT 4 More than a day later they called me and I didn't pick it up. I am bothered by the fact that they should be more sensitive considering they're specialised in these kinds of disorders. Immediately afterwards they texted me and I thought they would have realised and would communicate by text. But the text said You have a missed call from me. Tell me when you're available. sigh I think I'll try to tell my current therapist after all because it gives me less anxiety than changing.,Personality-disorder

51467,All I am is a useless burden I volunteer at a place that I like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because I like helping people plus Itll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days I didnt show up due to sickness. Now im supposed to text them when I dont show up my manager? boss? made that very clear. She even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that I absolutely couldnt take phone calls due to anxiety. Now I may or may not have just skipped that part as Id hate to bother them with a text plus its embarrassing. So basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that I cant keep not notifying them when I cant go and I have one last chance or shed rather have me not help out at all. This of course I soooo badly wanna say traumatized because it feels that way but ive experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasnt actually traumatic really hurt me. All I wanted to do was help. I just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all I did was end up being a burden. I hate myself for this im scared to even go in again. If I cant even hold a volenteer position im sure as hell arent ever going to be able to get a real job when I get older. I fucking hate this disease its taking my life away.,Personality-disorder
50565,Appearance and AvPD It seems superficial almost but my severe acne is contributing a lot to my avoidant tendencies right now. I'm doing everything in my power to treat it dermatologist prescription acne cream antibiotics clean bedding clean diet daily showers face wash etc. It just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst I've seen. I'm talking big red cysts. At this point I'm convinced my lithium is causing it.I was making decent progress too. I was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. I'm trying to work up to going back to work. But I just can't bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this. If I go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how I look and feeling gross I feel as though I'm doomed to fail. If my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then I pretty much have to bail. I'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. I don't know what to do it just feels hopeless. Between severe cystic acne and hyperhidrosis it is so fucking difficult to put myself into social situations. It's much safer to just hide away and wait it out but each day that passes is another day I've lost.,Personality-disorder

I truly dont think I can keep going with no hope of ever having any connection with anyone amp I dont know what to do. Its not like I even have anything to live for for me. My life is completely empty the only people I have around me demand so much of me ampor hurt me. I dont think Im even capable of building a better life amp if I am then I dont know if Im capable of making it for that long with absolutely no help from anyone.

Most of the RH shows are based on confrontation. But RHONJ is the most confrontational. As a man with AvPD when I see the husbands on that show just about fistfight in confrontation I feel anxious and lessthan. I know mist of it is staged but it always leaves me questioning my own manhood. Ive always been conflict avoidant in fight situation.

50667,Is there anyone else here who checks off all of the boxes for AvPD but cant ever get officially diagnosed with it because your case just isnt bad enough? Im fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that Ive been able to match up to down to a tee. Ive went to therapy and discussed my issues but it doesnt seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.While Im fairly certain I have avpd my case is more mild because it doesnt completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young Ive always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didnt have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that Ive been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. Its a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I cant get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?,Personality-disorder

Long story short Ive had such a hard time with finding and keeping work and part of it is because I have difficulty communicating especially when things done go as planned. Ive gotten so behind on a project that I feel frozen. The days and weeks just keep passing by and I keep avoiding talking to the client about the true status and stress keeps growing. Im afraid to even check my emails most days. I know what I need to do and I know I need to talk to the client so that I can move forward and also so that I can get paid but I really feel frozen with shame and avoidance and stress.

No one takes me seriously when I say that stuff that's happened to me has negatively affected my mental health. I'm basically told to calm down stop worrying even if it's really affected me. Basically just a refusal to accept and acknowledge that I've been hurt.I think is partly why I have avpd to start with. I guess this could be classed as some form of emotional neglect not having my feelings validated or taken seriously to the point where I've had to deal with my trauma by myself.,Personality-disorder

50875,Feeling guilt. I've had the perfect childhood all the opportunities great parents a lot of friends that even now 30 years later are my friends. My parents supported me in everything my mom is the best.Then I got meningitis and everything changed. I was never the same again. Started doing drugs to cope with my emotions yes weed is still an addictive drug partying all weekends with my friends. Xtc was just a normal thing when going to techno parties. It's the love drug... You feel so connected with others on xtc. Everyone was on xtc. Got addicted to weed for 20 years. Luckily I quitted with that 3 years ago.My mom was always worried about me. Now she's 73 years old and still worrying about me. It's my task now taking care of them. But I can't. My dad is dementing. When visiting them I use kratomlegal. I feel normal and happy then. Me happymy mom happy. But it's masking. Not the real me. If my mom sees me happy and positive... And yes... I notice that directly...if my parents are happy and not worrying... I feel better I don't want them to worry. I just want her to be proud she says it doesn't matter. I am who I am and she will always be proud of me. But... I see the difference i can read and feel emotions from others very good.... More a curse than a blessing. Sometimes I can't clean my house cause I feel to bad. And really.. It feels that people care more about that instead of me. The first thing they ask...did you clean. They don't ask... How do you feel.So if someone wants to visit me now I need to know it a few days before the visit. Then I clean even if I feel bad. My mom can't visit me unexpected.She wants to help me... I don't want that anymore. I'm not a kid. Masking my emotions with kratom for seeing people and not worrying them.. Yes I'm not complaining about my life when I see them I'm positive. And I really feel good than. So.. It's not fake... But In a way it's fake. It's making things worse. Not for the outside world they see me when I'm on kratom and don't understand why I'm on healthcare. Sometimes I hear that others are saying I'm taking advantage of the healthcare system. That's very hurtfull to hear.I realize I could have normal life. Just one dose of kratom.. And I feel normal. Like I want to be. But that's not how it works. Now if someone wants to visit me I use kratom for having less anxiety. And yes kratom is a miracle for anxiety depression. A very difficult choice.. Staying at home for weeks or using kratom going to a concert and seeing new people. On my YT channel I'm the most positive person. Making videos talking social. No one has a clue about how I really feel. My biggest fear is losing my parents.. And it's coming closer and closer. I feel so much guilt towards them. I can't even think about that. I owe everything to them. I want them when they leave this earth... I want them to know that I'm doing good. That it's not their fault. They don't need to worry. I will be alright. So they can go in peace. Gonna stop now cause I'm tearing up. Have a good evening.,Personality-disorder

51240,I'm ashamed of myself. I met a girl online in November and we tried to hit it off. It was a sort of long distance relationship since she lives about an hour's drive from me not critical but we don't have a car neither of us or days off to see eachother too often. In fact we've never met.On new year's eve she was attacked by a mutual acquaintance and she got bummed out and always kept apologizing when she thought she offended me.I felt so bad every time. I broke up a few days ago I dont know if you can really call it a break up since we never even met yet because I felt like garbage and I didn't want her to depend on me since I don't even know what to do to take care of myself.I didn't even have the courage to hear her afterwards. I apologized in advance in my last message to her and archived and silenced her chat before she could even text me back.I...Pat me on the back pls...,Personality-disorder

51279,Honestly do you think the label AvPD does you more harm than good? TLDR My therapist says labels might be helpfulempowering for some but might have a negative effect on others. Theres debates about this in the mental health community. It is in fact harmful for me so I have decided to stop seeking diagnosis for now.Recently my therapist told me how mental health labels might help some but have a negative effect on some.This discussion started when I requested a written diagnosis from her.In my case after discussing labels with her I was able to come to the conclusion that I tend to dehumanise myself because of the label.I treat myself as diseased or nuisance and often feel bad for not being as good as normal people.Theres a whole debate even in the mental health community about labels and how sometimes mental health professionals might misuse it.So for now Ive stopped seeking out a diagnosis. But what about you? Do you think the AvPD label helps you?View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll10o854w,Personality-disorder

EVIDENTLY IT WAS A PITY INVITE AND IM GLAD NOT TO HAVE GONEWhy even write this? by the time I get any replies it will be too late anyways. The appointment is three hours from now.If I get another job I'm going to need references a network of aqcuantainces this time I can't rely on my family posing as acquaintances. I didn't build a network I never do now I want to run out of there.I didn't make any friends I don't want friends anymore I haven't had friends since elementary. Not only do they not respect me they also pity me.I was invited out of pity I know because they are surprised I said yes. This is the entire setup for the climax in Notes from Underground I read it I know perfectly how it ends up. No one knows my life better than I do and I have been gaslighted too many times into believing it was all in my head.If I don't go they also will remember and I have to make a presentation for them a month for now my performance will be scored by them.Just today we found out neighbors began to speak ill of me and my family.One day posthumanism will get rid of all of this bullshit they taking our jobs will be a cheap price to pay.

50792,I feel like I could be an amazing boyfriend but refuse to put myself out there anymore. I 28M have a rep in my friendgroup as being a great guy who refuses to date. In truth I kind of get off on feeling like Im withholding an ability or skill from someone. I enjoy the image of people being jaded that theres no good guys left and that I am present could be an amazing boyfriend but amUniquely against beingacting that way and it making them sad if that makes sense.I grew up in a family very withholding of affection it was very conditional so i think I learned to reverse that in a weird powerplay in a way.

50982,Is it petty to treat someone the same way they treat you? Recently I noticed I was people pleasing too hard and decided to try a little less. I was too clingy was the one to wait after class to go together was the one to write first etc. My friend usually doesn't do the same and as someone with rejection sensitivity predictably it hurt. So when I stopped trying so hard my friend seemed hurt. She said something about me not waiting for her like I usually do. Admittedly it felt good to finally let go a little and have some selfrespect. But I also feel so bad for being kinda... petty. I don't think she did all this on purpose because overall she is a really good and caring friend. Maybe I just frustrated her with being too clingy in the past?,Personality-disorder

Less drama no risk of annoying people. But then I also wonder if maybe in reality Im just loud sometimes to make up for the way too many times Ive kept everything inside? Idk but that leads me to another question. How can you truly heal from your problems when it would require getting rid of coping mechanisms held in place all your life?I should add Im generally a very quiet person.,Personality-disorder

Thought it might bring more awareness for yall especially for the ones who are unofficially diagnosed and highly suspect they may have it. Although I have enough clarity to know I have it undiagnosed this is hands down the best breakdown and description of each possible symptoms that come with it. Never heard it like this before. It's not like your typical DSM5 avpd symptoms that are more generalized and broad. This is more in depth and even more eye opening since I resonate so much with all of them.

50611,Nobody in my life has ever truly known me. I put up so many masks around everybody. I show some parts of myself to some people and other parts to other people. And some parts I never show anybody and probably never will. Nobody in my life has ever truly known me they only know the person Ive shown them. Its exhausting but its basically second nature at this point and I literally dont know how to be anything else. I find myself telling so many little lies even about the most mundane things about myself and I dont even mean to do it on purpose. My opinions are always what I think the other person wants to hear. Every word I say and everything I show on the surface is always a watered down version of what I truly want to say and feel. Even when Im just in the car with someone I only play music I think they would like or what I want them to think I listen to. Most of the time I dont even know what parts of myself are true or not. Im like a puzzle made up of completely different pieces that dont fit together. Its all just so fucked. I dont know how to fix this. I wish there was someone who could see through all these masks and help bring out who I actually am but I dont even know if thats possible at this point.,Personality-disorder

Perhaps because I believe they must be some kind of special person to have enjoyed my company. I think my connections have always been more deep for me than the other person because Im desperate.I wish I wouldnt remember them. Wipe it all clean. Constantly being hit with intrusive thoughts of everyone who isnt around and how difficult those relationships were is exhausting. I had a dream about a close friend who abandoned me justifiably not even my self esteem talking I was a shitty person then reconciling with me over lunch. Extremely vivid and I felt so at peace after our conversation. So glad that she wanted to talk with me again. Then I wake up from this bliss all alone. Go to school alone.

51451,Is freezing during a conversation an AvPD symptom? Hi all! I'm new to this subreddit I was recently diagnosed with AvPD. I'm trying to understand it and come to terms with it.The thing is I don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks I know like my colleagues and friends I'm even morethanaverage social.However I do notice that I'm... slow in social interactions. I mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and I can't answer properly in the moment. Or I can't hear someone properly but I'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves ?! so I just kinda freeze andor act as if I heard what they said and the conversation goes on. Then later I think of a correct reaction and can't for my life understand why I shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then.This happens with friends too although it's more common with folks I'm not that comfortable with. Is this an AvPD thing or just a me thing?TLDR Is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an AvPD thing?,Personality-disorder
51430,this disorder has stopped me from pushing myself for the better me. Was scrolling on tiktok when I saw my previous school mate 2 years younger than me on my FYP. She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby her father was also a race car driver before helped her achieve big things but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. My best friend is so fckin smart she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart all of his grade averages are 95 100 is the highest in my country. I'm surrounded by smart and talented people with a future people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself while they're here working their ass off for their future.My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away. I'm gonna be 20 in october my teen years are finally over. I didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are supposed to experience. I can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.,Personality-disorder

51010,Is Aversion to physical touch affection cause anyone else to tense up and feel uncomfortable? Hi I'm not sure if this is an AVPD thing or a CPTSD thing...But I have a strong rejection of any physical touch that's comforting or affectionate.I'm permanently tense and hypervigilant and I now have a lovely dog who is so loving but I notice I basically reject her affection of leaning against me by tensing up. I've tried letting go and accepting the comfort of her touch but it leaves me feeling very strange and uneasy. My dog is very smart and notices the miniscule flexes of my muscles and my pushing back at her and will either walk away or try harder to 'love' me affiliate with me by persisting with her leaning against me with a little bit more weight. She's quite a teacher like that and could maybe help me learn to accept loveaffiliation.The same has happened with professional physical massages. I would be 'body armouring' against the touch and tensing up and trying to push away the masseur instead of relaxing and accepting the physical touch and enjoying that experience.I have a feeling this is related to an early life trauma thing... but I was wondering if any one with AVPD relates to this. I don't know why I feel so repulsed by physical contact it makes me feel squirmish and so uncomfortable in danger almost..Often if I initiate it and am slightly dissociated I can do it. But there's a wall there preventing it from being too authentic or entirely organic essentially going through the motions without mindfulness due to the layer of dissociation in the forefront.Then there are other times when I can genuinely be affectionate for a short while to my dog.. giving her a stroke or cuddle without being dissociated instead mindful. However after a little while this is when I think AVPD comes into play.... as I then start to think I suck at being affectionate and that my dog thinks I'm an idiot or annoying or needy or something. so total lack of self confidence comes into playMy experience of touch is kind of like comforting a strangerin my experience you're not 100 in the moment as you're not sure what to do to be there for them. Except I'm like this with giving all friendlyinformalaffectionate touch. And receiving it seems to scare me. It confuses me and makes me feel incredibly vulnerable and I rebel against it from the very core of my psyche and body. I can feel like a child perhaps toddler age.. inside me trying to fight off an opposing force.. when I am touched which makes me think it's a traumaCPTSD thing.Wish I knew how to work with it.. I get overwhelmed. No therapist currently..Things like I will start stroking the dog as it's happy to see me and wagging it's tail. But then when the tail stops wagging I'll instantly feel like I've done something wrong or the dog isn't enjoying the attention failuredefective schemas or low selfesteem simply. So I then try stroking her somewhere else or give up. gt I'm sure a therapist could help me navigate this quite easily.I do have times when It works I can be affectionate and not crumble in failure if the dog is non responsive I guess the other times I'm seeking validation that I'm being comforting? the times it works cohesivelynaturally are getting easier with practise... but I don't know any tools or practical ways to get better at it when I'm not feeling like it. Most of the time I just want to be alone.. and this dog is very affectionate and I don't want to fail at being reciprocate. and of course this is all prelude to having human relationships.. which are infinitely more complex.,Personality-disorder

51122,Just a question. Hello I wonder. How many people on this subreddit are diagnosed with avpd. In my case it started with social anxiety 20 years ago. Tried a lot of things nothing helped me so I gave up. I was on healthcare all that time. I still am. My untreated social anxiety evolved in all these years into avpd. Just a question.. Cause when I hear my friends say.. I have anxiety also.. But they're having a normal life. It's tiring hearing and reading such things. It feels like no one understands what it really is... having avpd.For me it started long time ago after having meningitis. Now after 20 years looking for answers this is upsetting to hear. My doc never told anything about it. He was my doc since I was a kid. This makes me mad. He ignored all these things. He knew everything about me but never made the connection with meningitis. My mental state when I left the hospitral the trauma...he ignored it all. I'm hearing this fromy parents know. How traumatized I was. My doc blamed me when I was using things trying to handle my anxiety and depression. Judging me for everything. I'm discovering this all now 30 years later. It's a shame. He's total ignorent. Not my doc anymore but i wanted to send a e mail to him.. Wanting answers...cause discovering this now is making me mad at my doc that knew me for 30 years. No one ever made the connection with meningitis. It wasn't written in any report. When I was reading story's of other people..I felt guilt. Thinking... But my youth was good... I'm just a crybaby.. Wanting attention. Finally 30 years later i'm getting answers. Way to late. If i have knew this decades ago.. My psychiatrists therapist.. My life would be maybe different now. My new doc and psychiatrist are saying this...why didnt anyone knew about this. They don't understand. Maybe times have changed. But it makes me made inside.,Personality-disorder

Hence my terminal aloneness. I wish it was terminal...Last year during the summer I temporarily got to experience what it was like to be wanted. A coworker and I became friends and she seemed to express interest in me. Time and time I'd go hang out with her only to go home banging my head in frustration and wondering wtf was going on. Here's my only other post about her for reference httpswww.reddit.comrAvPDcommentsw1us95situationinvolvingmarriedcoworker?utmsourceshareamputmmediumandroidappamputmnameandroidcssamputmterm1amputmcontentsharebutton Tldr of old post she's married but they are about to separate over issues they've had for years. For those that think I'm being scummy maybe. But she's leaving the country for good next month without him. Meanwhile she's seemingly expressed interest in me while at the same time holding me at arms length away. She tells me all of these personal things about herself including some secrets she says she's never told anyone. However If she gives me a hug it's half hearted most of the time. But with other guys like the one she said weirded her out she is willing to fully embrace them. Here's a worse part I have a car and she can't drive. So when she needed things she'd pretend to want to hang out and go check something out. Usually then we'd go back to her place and she'd cook something for me and I wouldn't feel it was a total loss getting food for the gas spent. But the last two times I went over there she kept going on and on about how tired she was so I left. Basically having been used as a free Uber. But here's the worst part!The other day on Valentine's Day I called her up and she's busy chatting with strangers on Omegle. This one guy is flirting with her and she keeps telling me about how good he looks... and how he wants to do an online video date with her clothes optional. The whole time she's giggling and basically ignoring what I'm saying. So I say I've got something to do and hang up. She has the fucking nerve to call me back and want a ride somewhere before she goes home to get some rest. I keep it short and civil what choice do people like us have? and basically hang up and go to bed. The next day I texted her to ask how did your little edate go? She responded huh? and I haven't talked to or heard from her since. Highly unusual because she always calls me several times on my 2 days off. Those days are over and I feel an incredible amount of stress about it.. my heart is going crazy and I feel like I'm waiting to get punished by the principle or something. I guess I lost whatever that was.. Life never wastes an opportunity to kick me when I'm down.,Personality-disorder

51164,Teasing Just wondering how many people take general or playful razzing super poorly or personally. For instance teasing between friends. I have a few friends that tease me about some of my hobbies and interests. Some times I fluff it off other times I get super frustrated and almost angry with them and feel like I'm somehow stupid or inferior for liking the things I like. Just wondering if that's a normal thing or if it is part of the disorder. View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll10w2p1s,Personality-disorder
51316,Have you ever overshared? If so how the hell do you cope? Ive literally been keeping all my feelings inside for years so its all just been building up and a few weeks ago I had a total breakdown and texted this guy I barely know just telling him about this thing that happened. And hes like twice my age and I just work next to him I saw him a fair bit but I never really talked to him of course because avpd so things were just always awkward. But the thing is he was super nice about it and so then I WAY overshared and texted him a bunch of personal shit and it made total sense when I was sending it and then the next day I was like what the hell did I send this guy? And now I feel SO embarrassed and I just dont know what to do with this feeling. And the worst part is I still cant talk to him I saw him for the first time the other day since sending that text and he was being so nice about it and I still couldnt talk to him. And I might not see him again for a while because my job is kinda changing right now but I just dont know what to do with this feeling.TLDR Got super emotional and texted this guy who I barely talked to a bunch of personal shit. So now he knows that Im messed up and also knows that Im so pathetic and alone that I like him way more than I should and I dont know what to do with this embarrassment.,Personality-disorder

50763,How much detail do you give when reaching out to people you've ghosted? I feel like I cannot move forward with my life until I right my wrongs and reach out to people I know I've hurt from ghosting. I wrote a 'letter I'll never send' mainly for my own benefit with way too much information about my life and my struggles but it seems way too intense to actually send out. I feel ready to take the next step of actually making contact but I just don't know how much information to give. Is a simple apology sufficient? This might be the avpd talking but I worry that by giving too much information I'll come off like I'm trying to justify the pain I've caused. I also dread the fact that they'll know how sad my life is but that cannot be avoided I guess. For those who have done it successfully any tips?,Personality-disorder
51275,Generalizing people is ruining me and I don't know how to fix it Just a quick example of what I meanSometimes you're just talking to a person and you're getting along great and you're just in that moment and you're enjoying it in its isolation and you think Wow you now what maybe things are fine and that person says something that just snaps you right back. It's not necessarily political but one example was a classmate I'm getting along fine with who is a woman but is heavily against feminism and once a month goes on a rant about it and it makes me just so exhausted and disinterested in pursuing that friendship. The other is my brother who's like Oh I'm fine with gay people but then yesterday 'joked' about how only the women that look like men are real lesbians I see the 'normal' looking women in lesbian relationships as just experimenting It's so fucking exhausting and isolating. And I live in a fucking racist homophobic shithole of a country to begin with and any time I meet at least somewhat of an openminded person they still have that one thread of fascism they refuse to let go of.And god it's fucking hard not to see this whole country as a country of neo nazis. No matter how much I try to focus on the positives all I ever see is people in ProRussian protest or people attacking alternative bars or spraying neonazi symbols on city walls. It's endlessly fucking depressing. And any time I complain about it to people they all say Oh don't look at it like that. Not everybody acts or thinks the way they think. But it's so hard not to. It feels dishonest and fake not to. And I already have trobules with being social and opening up to people and now there's always this layer of Oh well I gotta be cautious with what I say about what I think because any person could hold back some fascistic views . With men especially. The men here are a whole different kind of intolerant pigs.It's so bad that I'm constantly undervaluing my own opinions and thoughts. It fucking sucks. I never verbalize what I think or feel because this whole culture is built on constant arguments and belittlings and wanting to prove yourself right that it gets so exhausting to socialize. And I want to socialize. I desperataely want a friendgroup and a circle of people I'm comfortable with because I have none of that right now and it sucks because I can't even break out of that caution to even begin to start looking for people. And it's so hard not to filter people through an Ideological Filter because that's always what it boils down to.I don't want to care this much.I want to just fuck off the world and just be me. And I can't. I want people. I don't want to want people. It's so fucking lonely.,Personality-disorder

50821,I have just bailed on a friend for the third weekend in a row I feel pretty bad about it too. Last weekend I had plans I didn't and the weekend before that I actually was sort of going through something. But tonight... I just don't want to see anyone. So I cancelled again.But I am trying to make up for it and I offered to do lunch Sunday he's accepted.I'm unsure if I told him about my disorder and honestly I think he'd not get AvPD anyways. I have had many experiences telling people about AvPD and they just sort of give a wellmeaning but not getting it nod.I have been diagnosed with AvPD for well over a year now and I've been in therapy for even longer so I'm quite good at the whole mindfulness thing. So this year has been all about selfimprovement for me. And I just don't feel ready to go back out into the nightlife. We go to gay bars quite frequently we are both gay. I feel like I'm in my chrysalis as I finally work on myself for the first time like ever. Going out feels like I'm forcing myself to hatch too soon and I just imagine myself as this gooey halfbaked butterfly if I try to go out now. I want to get to my full form to go out and about. And I'm just not there yet.But further going out is a lot of things that could go wrong for me. Where am I going to put my car? Ubers are a lot of money here. What happens if I leave it at his place but I want to go home earlier than him? Etc. etc.Being alone in my apartment is just so peaceful. But it's lonely. And I know if I keep this up when the loneliness becomes too much further on down the road I might not have any friends left to see.,Personality-disorder

I know some will say it's in your head but no i really feel like my presence is just uncomfortable to be around. You know sometimes people can sense things? People can sense when you're sad or in my case uncomfortable in social interactions so they pick up on that and they aren't used to that so then everything becomes uncomfortable. I don't like this feeling.,Personality-disorder

51194,I'm trying to solve an internal issue externally And I know this wont work but idk what else to do. I just genuinely hate myself and I hope that maybe if I hit my goal weight I can finally have the confidence to talk to people and not feel so awful. Every social interaction feels like I'm being analyzed under a petri dish. Logically I know this isn't true but it feels true. This causes me to put on an act which causes me to not be present with people which causes the awkwardness that I fear. I'm focused on my facial expressions if I'm saying the right words with the right tone of voice. My mind goes blank half the time. I know that people typically enjoy it when you ask about them and their interests. Yet for some reason I just struggle to talk. I start stuttering slurring my words or going so overboard on sounding perfect that I sound like a robot reading off a script. .I just want to relax and enjoy myself. Sometimes I'm able to. Most times I'm not. I'm always waiting to feel embarrassed and then I go back to isolating myself. The motivation for change is there but I'm soooo scared and exhausted.,Personality-disorder
50507,How to deal with inperson avoidance? Hi dear community!I have a question my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.And I noticed that when hes going through an anxiety episode or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.For example if he feels embarrassed or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will hide behind his laptop or walk behind or in front of me distancing himself physically while still being kind its more of a way of hiding from me when he cant actually leave. For example when we share a hotel room on vacationI did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking that he does reciprocateeven when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but Im not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it or if he likes it that Im gently being reassuring and consistent.My dear AvpdErs when feeling low do you like being comforted or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!Thanks everyone !!,Personality-disorder
50810,Has tough love ever worked on any of you? My family is a very tough love type of family. As far back as I can remember my parents and sister have tried to get me to change my bad wayshabits through tough love but all the problems they would try to use it for are still with me so it clearly has never worked. Just as an example of what I mean my dad would give me tough love in the form of telling me no one would ever want to be my friend or hire me if I continued to be a fat slob true. And the other week my sister came over to the apartment and told me that I wasn't being cute or quirky by almost never cleaning I'm an adult and need to start acting like one it is extremely embarrassing at this point etc also true. But even though I know these things are true hearing people phrase it like hard truths I'm just too dense to grasp doesn't make me want to change for the better. It makes me want to go home put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger because to my family I come off as such a complete moron that they need to tell me obvious shit I already know.I am wondering if this type of tough love is actually helpful for anyone especially people with avpd because in my experience hearing people judge me like that just drives me to start spiraling down. It's like it really does solidify the fact that I am so worthless compared to actual human beings that they always have to talk down to me and my relationship with others always has to be me getting scolded even well into my adult years. But everyone keeps touting tough love as if it's some magic cureall that will make someone instantly snap out of whatever undesireable thing they're doing.,Personality-disorder

50817,Severe anxiety phone addiction and clinginess I am slightly shaking as I'm writing this. I hope this post isn't all over the place.ampx200BI have tried everything to combat my phone addiction from productivity apps to uninstalling social media and reinstalling them again etc. I gave up on school despite having been a very bright kid who skipped middle school grades as an immigrant to a new country but now I'm an extremely miserable and depressed 19 year old girl with absolutely no life and with severe anxiety. I keep my mind occupied by scrolling endlessly on my phone. My goto coping mechanism used to be daydreaming but now even daydreaming costs too much energy and the content of the dreams are almost involuntary and disturbing so now I dissociate differently through scrolling endlessly and losing track of time as well as my surroundings for 10 hours a day. Now my heart is beating hard and I'm feeling extra anxious and panicky all because I turned off my phone. I tried to get away from my laptop too but here I am writing this. I have pretty noticeable chest pain as a reaction of trying to avoid numbing my brain scrolling on tiktok. I feel pathetic. Currently I am having a really bad time. I feel left out and abandoned. My only friend and boyfriend who's the most wonderful human being is out with his friends. I'm happy for him but we haven't been able to call or play together for a week and even though I am an adult I am not in a place where I can just go hang out with him. I kept my relationship with him a secret from my parent who I live with to keep the peace and to not destroy the heart of my exceptionally kind loving and sacrificial mother who happens to be religious. My other siblings and I have disappointed her enough especially me her once very happy intelligent bright and ambitious baby. She knows I don't have friends or a job or any activities for that matter. I almost never leave the house except for going to my therapy sessions. So coming up with excuses to see my boyfriend has also been a huge challange. He has done his absolute best during our relationship. He is the most caring compassionate and nurturing partner of all time. He is my best friend a person I can be playful and comfortable with and I try not to make my AvPD or other mental health stuff effect him. I don't want him to feel guilty having fun with his friends but I am so extremely jealous. He can go out and do whatever he wants and he has friends he can do things with. Even if I'm his priority due to my circumstances I can't even make it all worth is. I'm currently depressed and have nothing fun to talk about or do I can't even find excuses to leave the house. So I'm not blaming him I am blaming myself for all of it. For how I feel for the guilt I feel after realizing how jealous and bitter my feelings are for being so uninteresting and for not doing more to change Trying not to use my phone now all of the sudden may also have to do with the fact that I don't want to stare at my notification the entire time waiting for a text from him. If he doesn't text I feel lonely and left out. If he does text I feel like I will never experience ever going to places and parties with him and I get jealous. I don't let him know these feelings while I'm feeling them. I love this person immensely. He gets worried about me and I don't want his weekend to be ruined by his clingy gf even though when I have breakdowns of any kind he reassures me that I didn't ruin his day and he prioritizes me over other stuff in his day to just either come and be with me we live in different cities or call me until I feel better. I want him to be happy. I have seen the positive impact I had on his life and his impact on mine and I'm scared that my loneliness and clinginess could hurt him or hurt either of us so I try to tone it down as much as I could. I'm tired I miss him so much and I also feel bad for missing him because I find it near impossible to do anything else with my time that he is the only thing left in my life.,Personality-disorder
50621,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know but in the platonic sense too.i don't even think i'm physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera.don't get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age i feel like it's too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people.but i think that's okay. somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food.there's some days when loneliness hurts though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.You think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont. In fact you feel more alone than you did before you left But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. Bojack Horseman,Personality-disorder

Sometimes I delete everything on my phone.. Feeling so much better but then I'm getting the fomo feeling. Installing all the apps again cause I don't want to dissapear and worry people. But it's most of the time the opposite...people I support suddenly dissapear. A difficult thing to handle. I'm replying to extended to DM's. When someone criticize me I overreact.. Feeling very bad afterwards.. I don't want to be that way. People dissapear with one touch on a button. And I'm thinking the worst. A person on IG when I had my mental health support page killed himself a while ago. We texted every night for months. I can't save or rescue people. But that was a difficult thing to deal with. Like I failed. So it's better to quit it all. Social media is poisoning society. I can't expect people to care cause I care for them. Sad but true. But it's a vicious circle.,Personality-disorder

People on social media always say Im trying to get attention but wtf is wrong with that? I dont know for sure if I have avpd but I think I do I cant pay for therapy I live with my mom and I hate her Im 18 cant drive alone I always get in crashes or get a ticket sometimes I speed because Im mad at my uncle. I have a job but I dropped out of school because I dont care and I have so much trauma from everything in my childhood. And anyway nothing matters now except being famous thats all I want I just have no idea why in real life I avoid people but online I have a girlfriend and Im obsessed with her it scares me sometimes because I cant stop thinking about her and if she broke up with me I dont think I could take it Ive only met her once in real life but it doesnt matter I talk to her all the time but the most important thing is that she talks to me and shes obsessed with me so I need her. I think I deserve to be famous more than anyone else because Ive been through so much and also I feel like Im better than most people something about me is different and Im special . Can someone dm me to talk more about this? I need to know why I want to be famous and how can I get famous? Also is it possible to have avpd and want to be famous?,Personality-disorder
51236,The regret of avoidance I've spent my whole life avoiding social situations that cause discomfort. I feel for me personally the end result has been not feeling a sense of fulfillment. This life is so short and we have to make the absolute best of it we can while we are able to. But I let everything fall by the wayside. I let my avoidance control me and continue to fail to accomplish anything or hold fulfilling relationships. Even if I miraculously get it under control I'll still have all of these years I spent in isolation doing nothing of value. I fear that on my deathbed I'll be alone looking back on my life in regret. Does anybody else feel this? That their time has been somewhat robbed by AvPD? I know it falls on me to make the change and that I can't play the victim but the regret is still there.,Personality-disorder

50916,I'm grieving a three day long situationship worse than people leaving a three year long relationship I have BPD and two and a half years ago I met a guy on a trip. We only hung out fro three days but our conversations were so interesting. We spoke about politics education etc. He told people he liked me. I was so excited that he liked me. Usually I don't take big leaps like this but since we live in different countries I went up and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and he cut off all contact with me. They broke up two months later and I'm 75 sure he's been stalking my social media since then but he hasn't reached out to me.I know it's been a long time but I miss him so much. I miss him. And I cry about him everyday. I need him. I just feel like I'm stuck in this pit of despair. And I've tried to change. I've dated other guys. There's another guy that I like way more and I know he likes me too. But there's still a part of me that misses the vacation guy. I don't know why I feel so stuck.,Personality-disorder
50533,this disorder has stopped me from pushing myself for the better me. Was scrolling on tiktok when I saw my previous school mate 2 years younger than me on my FYP. She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby her father was also a race car driver before helped her achieve big things but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. My best friend is so fckin smart she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart all of his grade averages are 95 100 is the highest in my country. I'm surrounded by smart and talented people with a future people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself while they're here working their ass off for their future.My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away. I'm gonna be 20 in october my teen years are finally over. I didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are supposed to experience. I can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.,Personality-disorder

51222,Isolation 10 Years Lonely and want Love Hello this is my first time posting on here! Im 26 F and have never been in a relationship. I have no friends. When I was in high school I had one friend but we parted and went separate ways. So the past couple years all I have been doing is listening to music with headphones on playing games watching films and daydreaming about love. I sometimes go out for walks in nature. I wish I could do fun stuff with someone one day. I recently came across someone who Im interested in. Weve talked and they seem nice. We have similar interests but Im afraid of speaking up and telling them how I feel. It sucks having this because my negative self talk wins and I run away from people. Sigh this is hard! ,Personality-disorder

51578,I feel like Ive missed out on my teenage years Its so depressing to think people have spent all these years going out with their friends and partying whilst I was just on my own in my room. Ive always had barely any friends and never been in a relationship or had a paid job I only managed to start doing a few hours a week voluntary work a few months ago. I watch the people around me do exciting things and make new friends and get partners whilst Im just here bored alone and depressed as usual. It doesnt help that later this year Ill move away from this town for university and Ill probably never see most of the people Ive spent years wanting to be friends or more with but been too scared to talk to again. It feels like this phase of my life is really slipping through my fingers and I have no time to repair it. I try to tell myself at least I have the future where I could become better and make the next phases of my life better than this one but in reality I know that Ive just been declining for years so I doubt that very much.,Personality-disorder

People always treat me so weirdly that I just have my alarm beeping all the time and I have to actively switch it off because I cannot tell anymore what's fake positive and what's actually a true warning.

I'm most likely also not going to see my friends again after moving away and I'm scared of being lonely in the new place. I also have to spend a lot of money on furniture and I'm worried about picking the wrong stuff. Additionally I have to make contracts for internet electricity etc. And what if I don't like the apartment after moving in? I wish I didn't have to make that many decisions.,Personality-disorder
51250,Avpd Adhd anxiety being an adult. Me again having another midlife crisis? I can't function in life. I have adhd and may have a bunch of other problems so I don't know if it's related to avpd or not. I forgot to take my thyroid hormone two days straight and I also didn't buy my antidepressants for some stupid reason. When I finally went to buy them they were out of stock. So yesterday I was super sad and vulnerable and also feeling physically drained like was going to pass out. Then came the anxiety and crying. Today thanks to my mom I bought my life numbing drugs after being scolded like a kid and I'm having another melt down. I don't know who I am anymore. Am I this mess of a person or is it the drugs? When I'm ok am I really ok? I feel so incompetent so stupid so weak. I can't take care of myself. My house is messy even though I try every single day to make it beautiful I have no job and zero courage or motivation to get one no independence. I feel so scared of everything of being alone in the end and dying alone. And knowing my life depends on me taking the thyroid hormones doesn't help. I need people so much but I'm terrified to reach out and be rejected. I'm afraid my husband will leave me even though he is super caring and loving. I'm afraid once people see the black hole in my chest they'll run away. I shouldn't need another human being like this since I'm in my 30s already. Don't even know where I'm going with this post. I just feel like life is incredibly hard for me but only in my head. I have it easy and I'm struggling to survive and maybe it'll always be like this because of avpd....?,Personality-disorder

I guess my education makes me very overqualified for it or something and its seemingly a relatively asocial role but the thought of even going to the interview fills me with anxiety.

51403,I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer most aspects of the job are too triggering and I cant handle it.Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 030 minutes of work the previous day I have no update to give I panic and have to lie and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame guilt and stress. Its already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do with the code or on Slack has a timestamp a notification and is visible to everyone. Once theres something Im avoiding committing code deploying code posting the code for review responding to someone testing code an upcoming meeting etc. I often go offline from inactivity and then Im afraid to even open my laptop which can take hours to overcome because once I do everyone can see Im online on Slack my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people Im not responding to my manager.I already got in trouble for not doing my work missing meetings not responding to people for days or weeks and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a monthlong probation which Ive gotten past only because I didnt ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend Im struggling way less than I am. I cant admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing or how much communicating with people the most important part of the job so fundamentally terrifies me.I know every trick in the book about procrastination time management breaking down tasks but thats not enough when Im this afraid of people. Ive accepted I need help from another person. Ive talked about this some with friends but none of them understand so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and Ive been trying to find a therapist but theyve all been unhelpful many actively harmful.I know it's a slow process but every single day at work is like torture and Im on very thin ice. Because I cant get the work done its not endurable and I dont have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I dont want to quit because I havent been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job for the same reasons. But I cant stay like this for months until I find someone and begin making progress.I dont know what to do,Personality-disorder

50683,I went to a party! I actually went to a garden party! There were tiny sandwiches a bunch of fruit and little cracker plates with meats and cheeses. I actually felt comfortable the whole time!I've been on some medicine these past few weeks I can't remember the name and I think they may actually be working. I still get depressed andor anxious around the night time or when I'm not doing something. I just have to keep myself busy and I'll be okay.But about the party. I knew almost everyone there I've known them for a long time now and they're closer to me than my family. I helped set up the party so I didn't feel like I wasn't being useful I took my time this morning in making sure I looked presentable and of course I showed up early just in case. The party lasted about an hour and a half and I even got to talk with some of the people there! Today is just a great day so far and not if but when things start to go back down to normal I hope I don't forget that I was able to be happy today. I know progress can jump forward just as much as it falls back but I'm going to celebrate today as progress!,Personality-disorder

50706,Id rather be alone than feel like this Went on a date a week ago for the first time in years. Normally I am not attracted to people but this time I felt super attracted to this person. Good talks and the whole day we spent together. We had sex but I did not sleep at that persons place bc thats too intimate for me I see sex a something purely physical but sleeping is too scary for me. However that person didnt text me for a week so I texted to ask to go to a concert with a mutual friend. Still no response for 2 days. I feel so insecure and rejected and it confirms the negative view I already have about myself. I really would like to have a relationship and fall in love but even dating makes me feel so worthless ugly stupid and anxious even after one date. Sorry for the vent but this is the only place I feel I can share this. Other people say that I just need to relax stop overreacting and stop being insecure and blablabla. Thats why I never share these feelings with people,Personality-disorder
51008,Anyone run the other way from their friends? I have always struggled making friends developing deeper relationships and feeling safe in friendships. Once a friendship starts to develop into something deeper I run the other way. I think Im so scared of being rejected that I reject myself before it can happen to me or catch me off guard. I think Im also paranoid that people are just being polite and no one actually likes me especially if I pick up on any tiny clues that this might be the case. Clues look like friends not texting in a while friends not inviting me to something hanging out with other friends without me or just some way that I interpret their communication or tone. Does anyone experience this and how do you keep from running the other way when you cant interpret if youre truly wanted as a friend or if you need to back off? Do I just need to take a leap of faith?,Personality-disorder
51479,Anyone else lie as a child? Not sure if its an AVPD thing but growing up I told a string of lies to all of my very few friends. It weighs on me almost daily. Some were really horrible like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. Of course thats not real. I cant believe I said those things to people but it felt like the only way at the time.Through a lot of reflection I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person because I didnt deserve them. But nothing in my life that I understood at the time was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if youre not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge its not a valid mental health condition. I didnt think I had any reason to have the problems I did so I had to give people fake reasons to make them believe it because my parents told me thats the only way.Also somewhat of a test like if they stay for this horrible person Im pretending to be theyll surely stick around for who I actually am if thats better. And its not hard to be better than that given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave then Ill have been in control of the rejection. And theyre not reacting to the true me anyway so the judgement doesnt hurt as badly. Avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person.,Personality-disorder

I feel like the best times for my mental state and relationships with others have been when I've been forced to do things together and have a very regimented schedule and I don't think my current occupation is tenable for much longer. I have a graduate degree in engineering so I was thinking perhaps trying to become an officer although I'm not so confident in my leadership ability. Perhaps for a support role such as intelligence or a pilot or some other more specialized service? I guess as a bonus I've done a lot of milsim activities and hobbies throughout my life so far and I don't really have any relationships or people except my distant parents to tie me down to a specific location.I'm not taking any medication and although I've brought up this disorder to my psychiatrist I haven't received an official diagnosis one way or the other as it's not their policy to label patients.,Personality-disorder
50554,Is freezing during a conversation an AvPD symptom? Hi all! I'm new to this subreddit I was recently diagnosed with AvPD. I'm trying to understand it and come to terms with it.The thing is I don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks I know like my colleagues and friends I'm even morethanaverage social.However I do notice that I'm... slow in social interactions. I mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and I can't answer properly in the moment. Or I can't hear someone properly but I'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves ?! so I just kinda freeze andor act as if I heard what they said and the conversation goes on. Then later I think of a correct reaction and can't for my life understand why I shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then.This happens with friends too although it's more common with folks I'm not that comfortable with. Is this an AvPD thing or just a me thing?TLDR Is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an AvPD thing?,Personality-disorder

Growing up having my parents always telling me I'm intelligent and making a big deal of it always getting good grades and whatever my ego takes such a huge hit when I lose again and again and again. I feel so stupid. I ended up asking him if he would walk me through his moves while we play chess so I can have clear examples of how to apply different strategies. It was maybe the most ashamedpathetic I have ever felt. I feel a bit better now but fuck I just want to be able to have fun with him.

50957,Getting out my comfort zone Im a 24 year old female and Ive had a lot of mental health issues. One of them is AvPD. I struggle to maintain friendships because I always push them away out of fear they will see the real me and I think Im an empty person with no personality. I never developed my own personality. I always mirrored people to fit in.I have an intake tomorrow for a rehab clinic. Im addicted to Xanax. I think the addiction is just a result of my mental problems that are really complicated and go far back into the past. After the rehab I will go to Portugal for an intense treatment for 2 months all by my own. No phones allowed. I think itll do me really good and Im glad I have this opportunity. I know they arent going to fix my problems and I need to do it myself but it is a big step for me to travel alone. To really work on myself. Its a step forward.

Im fairly sure I have this disorder because Ive looked into it a lot and I resonate so much with what I read online about it.Im just wondering what people mean when they say this disorder causes a lack of sense of self? I 100 have this issue but Im not really sure why? Im usually thinking of it in a social context because it feels like Im not enough of a person to make connections but I dont know if its for the same reason you guys might feel that way.

50692,Don't know how much longer I can take the loneliness I haven't had a bf or been intimate with a guy in 10 years. I can't fend off the feeling of desperate loneliness anymore. I've been trying Tinder for the 2nd time used it for a brief period last year but never really talked to anyone before uninstalling and have been forcing myself to put in an effort responding to messages and messaging first. But it hasn't been going well...there were a few guys who I thought I was hitting it off with but they all stopped responding to me eventually. The last one hurt the most because I had gathered up the courage to ask him to meet me. I don't know what I did wrong I thought things were going ok we had been chatting regularly for a little more than a week. I messaged him again this morning to let him know I was available today if he wanted to see me and he still didn't get back to me and probably never will.I'm devastated right now. I was so happy about talking with this guy a few days ago and now I'm back to being as lonely as ever. Another lonely Friday night...I don't know how much more of it I can take. I don't know if I want to keep trying if it's just gong to be constant rejection. It seems inevitable I screw everything up and drive people away with my shitty personality I shouldn't even be surprised this happened but it still hurts so much ,Personality-disorder
51141,Acceptance This is a difficult topic to discuss but I'm genuinely curious as to ifhow others have done this and what impact it has had on their lives.The kind of acceptance I'm talking about isn't just an intellectual acknowledgement of having issues. For a long time for example I could say to myself that I'm depressed anxious and struggling to succeed in life at least by metrics of the culture that I reside in. That's relatively easy to do.What I'm speaking of is a shift in perspective where you allow yourself to be disabled and accept living life very differently than what is expected. In doing so you effectively turn off the mechanism that activates masking which exposes vulnerabilities and just say F it I'll deal with the consequences. This means that You accept that you'll be targeted by others misunderstood and often viewed as low status because generally people aren't very understanding of problems that aren't obvious like a physical disability. You accept that you're not likely to be appealingattractive to potential or existing romantic interests. This is particularly salient to men who are selected for traits that showcase an ability to provide. You accept that you'll need emotional financial andor vocational assistance for the remainder of your adult years. As such you must let go of a desire for a fully independent lifestyle. You accept that in all likelihood what you have to say won't hold much value to others outside of a supportive setting. Maybe you didn't have much to say anyways. You accept a humility of attitude and position. You are no longer competing with others in the rat race at least not directly and have no need to get ahead.. and.. You accept that you weren't motivated to do so to begin with. Moving mountains around just isn't your thing. An image comes to mind of a disheveled man holding a sign on the street corner. I imagine there's no pride left to speak of in someone like that. Just acceptance that the world isn't meant for some kinds of people. I know this sounds depressing but this is where I'm at in considering how to proceed with my life. It feels as though I'm flailing around grabbing at the air helplessly in some futile effort to grasp on to an ideal of something I'm not.. a normal selfsufficient person. Just to be clear I don't want to be homeless. I'd hope to do just enough to avoid that. But what this level of acceptance implies is a sense of freedom to be myself as I am in the present moment without fighting it.The idea here is to do something radically different to change my outlook and ease the stress that I'm experiencing. I would guess others here can relate to that stress which is the definition of AvPD.So has anyone taken this journey and would be willing to share some wisdom? Is this kind of acceptance a good idea?Or does anyone want to share their thoughts generally?It's important to add that this isn't a great idea for young folks. This is something you would consider later on after having tried and tried again.,Personality-disorder

51405,How to deal with inperson avoidance? Hi dear community!I have a question my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.And I noticed that when hes going through an anxiety episode or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.For example if he feels embarrassed or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will hide behind his laptop or walk behind or in front of me distancing himself physically while still being kind its more of a way of hiding from me when he cant actually leave. For example when we share a hotel room on vacationI did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking that he does reciprocateeven when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but Im not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it or if he likes it that Im gently being reassuring and consistent.My dear AvpdErs when feeling low do you like being comforted or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!Thanks everyone !!,Personality-disorder
50892,does trauma play a part in your avpd? i was wondering how many people think the disorder formed because of trauma in their childhood? for me the main reason i have avpd is because of emotional neglect and trauma from bullying. i think symptoms started showing up during the bullying. my self hate really took off from there. its kind of a mess though since i was dealing with depression and anxiety at that age but i can see it all makes sense why i have these symptoms. after just a few years of it i completely isolated myself and spent years in solitude. i dont think i would have avpd without all the trauma as a child. from what i see on certain posts is that some people dont seem have that factor in the formation of their avpd. whats your experience?View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11dwi28,Personality-disorder

50819,Therapist concerns I want to give this therapist more of a chance and I'm tired of looking. The one I had previously was too casual and kept directing the conversation towards family drama rather than focusing on me. The therapist I have now talks a lot often feeling like a motivational speaker. It seems like a lot of her advice boils down to just do it which isn't always a negative but I'm not looking for simple actions to take which is important but CBT can be extremely disappointing. I'm interested in delving deep into my psyche but she doesn't seem as curious as I'd prefer. She doesn't ask enough questions and seems to assume a lot about me as if my concerns are simply general concerns with general roots behind them. She talks specifically about surface problems but vaguely regarding experiences and the reasons for problems in this life. I know that we all share a lot of the same feelings and experiences but that's not what I'm interested in emphasizing and to be honest it doesn't make me feel better. I already know other people feel similarly to me I already know that but I also know that everyone's experience is different. People go to these pages to feel less alone and it does help slightly but that's not enough. I don't care to hear that I'm normal it just feels minimizing. I want to connect with people but feel utterly incapable of doing so even when I put myself out there and have conversations I feel like I'm not really there talking to them and they're not seeing me. My therapist wouldn't even see the AVPD she thinks I just have depression. I don't know what to do I'm scared to open up to her about my concerns I don't know how I would do that. CBT is helpful in that it gives people practical ways to help themselves and take control of their lives like taking small steps for example. But it's not enough for me.,Personality-disorder
50674,Societal Standards Not sure if this is just me but the more I self reflect the more i realize that im unhealthily antisocial but ok with that until i feel societal pressure to be different. Ive always been a loner and i can be like that ALL the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who arent like that and find it weird. Its almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because thats what you need for a happy life apparently but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure theres literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess Im deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and cant relate to others and feel insecure about it like I wish I could be in the standard of whats normal but Im also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy its hard to put into words how I feel but its like Im so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people dont live their lives like that.

51114,therapy with avpd does it even work? ive been in and out of therapy since i was 13. thats half my life. ive seen psychologists psychiatrists social workers and counsellors ive been through CBT DBT goal focused therapy grief therapy. ive been on so many medications. ive never been allowed myself to become unstable enough to be hospitalized and ive been able to be the bare minimum functional and composed enough to fly under the radar of more intense interventions. when it comes to therapy i have a severe problem with trusting my therapists failing to disclose what i really need help with struggling to express my true thoughts worrying excessively about judgement and criticism and leaving therapy after the initial hope of this one will be what helps dies out likely because of aforementioned problems. in march 2020 i was diagnosed with bpd but for reasons it was march 2020 i never got it addressed but now that i have insurance that covers most of the cost of sessions i want to try again. im paying some out of my own pocket too and i dont know if its even worth it due to my history with therapy i sent in a general inquiry to a private office close to me and they referred me to a male therapist which terrifies me as ive only had female therapists before and who uses a different approach psychodynamic therapy which is again fucking terrifying.i want to ghost and just not do this so badly and im just fighting against myself arranging two 2 emails is exhausting and fucking nervewracking and i dont even know if this is going to go anywhere. i dont even know if im asking for advice or just venting but thanks for reading anyway,Personality-disorder

51476,More Clarity Insight amp Awareness An article I wanted to share with you all to read. Thought it might bring more awareness for yall especially for the ones who are unofficially diagnosed and highly suspect they may have it. Although I have enough clarity to know I have it undiagnosed this is hands down the best breakdown and description of each possible symptoms that come with it. Never heard it like this before. It's not like your typical DSM5 avpd symptoms that are more generalized and broad. This is more in depth and even more eye opening since I resonate so much with all of them.

50729,Starting to feel really guilty over ghosting my entire family Im leaving this weekend not telling anyone where Im going and leaving my keys with a note explaining Im okay and not to look for me. Changing my number and not giving it to anyone I suffer from really severe social anxiety to the point where I even isolated myself from my family. I feel like I have nothing here. No friends no job I messed up my relationship with my family by barely leaving my room. They all think Im awkward and weird. It doesnt help Ive become a pretty bitter and rude person over the last couple years because of how miserable I am in my life my fault I know. Feel like I have screwed my life up too much Im an embarrassment and want to go where nobody will recognize me My mom was ashamed of me ever since I started being socially anxious around 6th grade. She hated how quiet and unpopular I was. She can also be very clingy overprotective and worried too much. I cant handle it anymore I feel totally smothered. I just want to get out on my own even if Im living in my car for a while. But I am starting to feel extremely guilty because I know shes going to freak out when she sees the note probably have a panic attack and call the whole family probably telling them Im missing. I feel like my parents do not trust me whatsoever and see me as some useless idiot that will never be able to have her own life Im planning on alternating between motels sleeping in my car and working my way up to renting a room in someones house somewhere,Personality-disorder

Its hard to not avoid avoid avoid and feel like a burden especially when you have people you love and know care about you. My heart and mind conflict so much because Im so sensitive and Ive just built a wall after years of negative feelings and rejections but my heart wants the exact opposite. And I get so lonely dealing with depression alone wondering why do I have to deal with this all the time but it hurts the most to be going through it and hurt the people you really love like I dont want to be a burden anymore but its easy to feed the demons that are telling you to avoid avoid avoid and the fear.

51427,Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. Even then the relationships I do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.,Personality-disorder

50550,Feeling down lately It was my birthday the other day and it was a bit depressing. I spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza it was good though lol I didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake also good. I was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my momI dont have many friends besides a few online friends and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me. When I see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry. My friend says everybody cares and loves me but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their livesTo make this worse my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her. The last time i had a therapist who knew of my avpd they screamed at me and said i couldnt be helped...This is all just making me feel hopelessly depressed and feeling rejected ,Personality-disorder
51367,Who else here is limerant? Just wanting to get an idea of the number of people who are limerant for unavailable people. For me it's always a man in a teaching or mentorship position who is married. Married because that means I'm safe. He's not going to act I'm not going to act. There isn't going to be a relationship. The attraction is just going to float in the air like a butterfly. Such intense but unattainable beauty. So much out of reach. I am in close almost daily contact with such a man. Its annoying me because I know its hopeless and could never go anywhere but I am addicted to it. Addicted to any little morsel of recognition he gives me. Addicted to making him laugh. It makes my day to make him laugh. He has no idea about the depth of my feelings because I am a person with AvPD and I know how to hide my emotions even lie about them and shut everything down. My brain is basically screaming 'stay safe stay safe.' I don't know who I am more annoyed with me or him. I think making him laugh is the way I make him comfortable with my attraction to him. Its like it must be pretty obvious I'm basically broadcasting 'I don't love you I'm just an awkward friendly doofus please like me.' It is intensely sad to me that this is the closest I will get to love. But even that is addictive. Sad beauty. Sad beauty is better than the grey anhedonia I am used to. I hope this makes sense. I hope someone understands or can relate.,Personality-disorder

51202,Autism and AvPD crossover? Hi so I'm diagnosed with autism and years ago about 14 I was diagnosed with social anxiety as well. I recently found out about AvPD and I feel like I relate to the majority of symptoms I've found.I checked on the autism subreddit about this but i found someone arguing that you can't diagnose people with autism and AvPD because it's so hard to tell. Which confused me.I'm currently 17 turning 18 in September. I attend a sixth form college but that is literally the only place I go. I have no remaining friends even though I really want close friends and people have tried to make friends with me. I really avoid making friends though bc I feel so awkward and uncomfortable and trying to interact with people makes me so tired that I can't cope with it. But its a constant struggle between feeling so lonely and really not wanting to talk to anyone. I can't tell if this is specifically just autism or maybe AvPD because I find a lot of autistic people don't actually avoid making friends rather just struggle to. I can't go anywhere by myself I've never been to a shop alone before because of who I could have to speak to or if anything went wrong. I feel sick at the idea of actually approaching people or speaking in a group. I can rarely text I can't make phone calls and I don't like going out so I lose friends pretty quick because I essentially ghost them even when I don't mean to. This is one of the main reasons I don't want to make new friends because I know I'm not a great friend. In the future I plan on doing a job either part time or from home because I can't cope with interacting with people. At school in my free periods I can't even stand sitting in the same room as others especially if they're talking. And I can't eat in front of others. I feel like I'm on show. These don't apply to my parents or my older sister. If I'm with them these are easier.Originally I thought it was just being autistic or social anxiety or agoraphobia maybe. But then I found out about AvPD. It definitely could just be autism. But I feel so isolated and lonely but I dont want to be around anybody and I can't bare the thought of this being my entire life without any chance of it getting better. Could anyone maybe just tell me if you have any similar experiences or advice? I'm just not sure what to do.,Personality-disorder

I listen to podcasts to go to sleep and listen to youtube videos CONSTANTLY I feel the need to have a video going even walking from my room to the bathroom.

50594,Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart and attractive and I care for people but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my first love?The first guy Dave I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side. We only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. The second guy Steve I met a year later at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives. We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wpn90,Personality-disorder

But I was mostly afraid to tell my boss that I didn't want to renew my contract too scared to see disappointment on her face and to let them down...

50996,Does your anxiety fear of judgment rejection or humiliation stop you from doing daily basic tasks ? Do your triggers replay in your mind constantly ? I can said I have hight functioning AvPD. I go to work teach my classes .I'm constantly wanting to improve and develop a strong career path and get enough money for surviving in a Latin American country. But a few things happened while in quarantine I was depressed isolated with my family grieving that a part of my body wasn't functioning well and got removed that destroyed me and on top of that my religious trauma and the stupid comments of my mother who things all the things need to be her way or not be at all. She hurt me terribly. Anyways as I isolated i created a new perspective of shame and was constantly bullied by neighbors for my attitudes and behaviors as I was bragging a lot due to my financial and career position were higher than of those adults around me just at 22. I know that's awful and was against my original principles but I think I just tried to cope. I'm more mature i recognize it was a mechanism to avoid rejection and shame. Like You can laugh or make comments about me but you are average and I'm not. I started working at higher education by the time . I feel so much shame after all that happened and my avoidant traits have gotten even worse. I barely leave the home. I just go to my job go home and repeat the cycle everyday. I am going through some medical difficulties nowdays and I have to come to the realization that I can't live like this anymore. This is not life. I don't do anything else apart from working and existing I cannot practice any hobbies or watch anything cuz I think that if I sing in portuguese or Spanish or English somebody on the other side of the wall is gonna be ready to laugh at me. I don't even talked to my parents unless I feel sure nobody could hear us. Sometimes I try doing something and past memories come to hunt me . I tried moving out on my own but the fear of being judge for being a female living alone and not talking to anyone has taken me out of the apartment and I've been paying it for two months now without living there. Putting as an excuse that once I recover more from a recent surgery I had I'll go back to my place. Bless your heart if you took the time to read all these mess.,Personality-disorder
51265,Architecture student with AvPD. This is almost like a cosmic joke! This course is definition of criticism. Working sleepless nights on projects overthinking of the negative reviews is constant nightmare and I'm excelling the art of escapism. I'm 23 and this is the THIRD fucking time I discontinued college. THRICE. I didn't know what was wrong with me. I was always avoidant from before I even had the memory of it but I thought that was just my normal nature. I just discovered that I have AvPD from the recurring symptoms. It is destroying my life. It's progressing on the path to hell. It all makes sense now. My choices. My running away. The pattern is embedded deep into my subconscious. I feel hopeless and suicidal. I have never been to therapy haven't talked about it to anyone yet. My family might be supportive although none of us has ever been to therapy before. I'm hanging onto this little hope that I could do better with professional help. It's not too late. Should I tell them or not. Idk.

50645,just turned to my coworker and talked one day i've always been in awe of people who can just start talking. every time i think 'i could say this!' it's immediately dogpiled with other thoughts. the self hating ones. i don't have it in me to list them right now but if you're reading this unfortunately you probably know what i mean. anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday and i got my marlboros out of my locker. smoking is bad i know. i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy. so i turned to my coworker notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew and said hey check these out. and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries but not here USA. i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since especially not while 100 sober. it was nothing. and the self hating thoughts came right after. but once those settled a bit it was nice. thanks so much for reading i just wanted to ramble as always.,Personality-disorder
50632,Anyone here try making online friends? For me its difficult because everyone is more advanced than me or younger. Many people are focused on careersproductivityschoolfamily. I always feel like a kid compared to others when I observe or interact with people.Another issue that would happen is the few people I found remotely on my level would ditch me after some months. I think it does not work with people if you do not objectively help the person or intend to interact with them on a physical or visceral level rather than just talking about interests or random stuff.In theory I should just go ask people if they want to play certain games but it does not feel right if people just opening up about their personal lives or bantering with me makes me feel like trash.

51502,I recovered from AvPD. What will help others? I dont believe in matters of mental health ever truly being 100 cured.Even though I still have some AvPD traits that Im still working on my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.Ive gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.All through school people called me socially retarded and my mom thought I was autistic.To now being a very socially skilled confident outgoing person who makes friends easily.Im curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how Ive recovered from my AvPD what helped me how long it can take etc?I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible and spreading that false message. It is possible! Its just really hard uncomfortable takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? Im also open to suggestions of what else could help.P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry skeptical reaction or think Im being narcissistic.

51351,I feel the need to take revenge because I was isolated I dont care if this sounds edgy Im going to mention it anyways. Ive been bullied out of school as the same with online. Ive began to develop a hatred for anyone thats not like me. I had a vent account and the amount of people who just didnt understand how severe my isolation was insane. I had so many people telling me you just want to be edgy and I even got called incel on numerous occasions for saying women and relationships make me feel uncomfortable. It felt like everytime I reached out to others on the internet what I thought could be a safe space lmao there was always someone who had to pick me apart and find everything wrong with me. After awhile I gave up trying to reach out and now on other social media accounts I say things just to piss people off. Even if I dont agree with the things I say online half the time I just need to get that rage from some people. I dont know how this fixes anything for myself if anything youd think people telling me to end my life for fake opinions would get me to stop. Ive come to hate almost everyone. As long as I know people were mad enough to send me death threats I feel like ive given them some sort of revenge. I cant do anything about what happened to me in my personal life and I hate it. I think feeling lonely for so long has made me feel anger toward those who didnt accept me. Have any of you also gone through this or do I seriously need therapy?,Personality-disorder

51205,New here. A work related conundrum. I'm a male in my late 30s struggling to find traction in terms of being able to support myself. Recently I've only lasted a few weeks in a couple of different environments retail and warehouse. I could do the actual jobs well enough but I get tripped up socially targeted by others and quit as a consequence. I've had a difficult time throughout my adult years sustaining employment. There have been times where I had long term prospects but they ultimately ended badly. This has me in a pretty desperate mindset and I've decided to seek services for help finding something suitable.What I want ideally is to have a space to work as independently as possible with low social expectations and predictable responsibilities. I've been doing some gig work off and on which meets those requirements but that isn't a reliable income and you burn through gas. My wife who makes OK income is being as patient and supportive as possible with me but we need a second income especially with living costs skyrocketing. It's crucial that I maintain a job so that I can keep the marriage stable and avoid homelessness which is what would likely happen if things fall apart. We don't have kids so at least that isn't an issue at stake.I should add that I'd never qualify for disability benefits given my education and work history. What have others done to be able to support themselves long term? What accommodations if any have you asked for in a job? And finally has anyone significantly improved their selfimage and ability to handle the BS at work?Thanks for reading.,Personality-disorder

If there's someone I'm attracted to and there's nothing problematic in their profile I won't swipe on them because I doubt they'll be interested in me. In the end this leaves a very very small pool of people which I guess makes the whole thing pointless?,Personality-disorder
50705,I get very down when people don't include me socially but But I don't even wanna get to know them at all? It's like I'll get sad and feel like no one wants to be around me and I'm excluded a lot. I'm never the first choice. But if I actually get it my way and get included and someone try to befriend me I suddenly lose interest and change my mind. It's very annoying. I know I actually don't wanna befriend anyone right now but I get sad when I'm excluded or not chosen regardless. I wish I could be more careless. I know why this is tho. Because if they actually show interest in befriending me and they find me pleasant to be around I will get kinda overexcited and will be with them at all times and sometimes that scares people away. It's either I avoid people like the plague or I get too attached. Both is equally as bad tbh. But I can't help but feel sad when I see people get along so well so easily and so fast while I'm sitting by myself. There's times I starve not on purpose but because I don't wanna sit in the cafeteria at school. Where do I even sit. This week I've only eaten two pizza slices and some candy also drank some chocolate milk. I just don't wanna be around anyone. I managed to grab some dinner from the cafeteria earlier tho I live on campus.I have two years left of my time at school and I'm trying to just force myself through it all. I know I won't get better and I can't try as much as I would like but I know I'll go back to being avoidant the second something goes wrong. I can be the most friendliest person you've ever met and be lively and bubbly but the very second someone shows the most minuscule sign they don't enjoy being around me I start to go into avoidant mode. I'll lock myself up in my room and go offline from all social medias play games all day appetite depletes and all that stuff. It can last for months.Well anyways that was just a little rant if you will. I don't have anyone to talk to obviously and thought maybe someone here would understand and relate. At least it helps a little,Personality-disorder
51563,How to cope with shame Hello I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame shame of what I did in a specific moment shame of how I reacted what I've said shame on how I was dressed the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things because anything material has more value than me . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things. ampx200BHow do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life? When I remember one time I start remembering the others they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence that they already happened that there is no way I could live with those things that happened. I feel shame from myself all the time but when those memories come to me I want to snap out of existence. I don't know how to deal with that. Thank you.,Personality-disorder

I never impose on her when she's doing her cat things.,Personality-disorder

I found family at work. I found god.I found peace within myself. maybe I never had avpd but I still identify with it. I do so strongly that I feel it necessary to post here because I relate to every one of your guys posts.and I came up with a 5 year plan to achieve my dream of rvandwellers. I have a lot of stuff I want to say. I have big big things in the works for my life. my goals are endless.you can find me on instagram nowatlast if you want to know about me. my entire life is there.

51329,It seems hopeless but is there any way to find a remote job online if I have avpd and don't really have... any redeeming qualities or skills for the market due to lifelong isolation and selfsabotage? I know that people who have their psyche together have an extremely hard time finding jobs too we live in very confusing times. And I'm less employable than most people of my age. I don't have a finished degree I don't have presentable look I don't really have hobbies other than videogames and some niche knowledge about obscure culture things I'm not great at communicating but more importantly I haven't worked or studied in about 4 years at this point so I pretty much forgot how to look and present human at this point. I'm not really interested in anything in the normal sense either due to anhedonia or general dissociation from my own emotions and needs. I'm thinking about therapy as something that could guide me and help me in life I know this is really all eggs in one basket kind of thing but I genuinely only believe in one thing and it's therapy. And to pay for any therapy I need money. But I'm so lost and hopeless in navigating job market I'm practically terrified because I'm a grown ass person and I have never worked in my life before other than one small online gig I got by pure luck and it was a one time thing and it's not repeatable and skills for that don't transfer anywhere. I've heard about things like rev or something like that but they banned my country because of recent world events. I was researching different sort of freelance stuff but I consistently got terrified of having to promote myself or even commit to any craft at all due to selfdefeating attitude my whole life. So in the end I don't know anything don't have any skills other than fluent english and my native language have absolutely no experience of any job whatsoever. It feels incredibly hopeless. Any tips? Maybe some websites that could help with making small money for manageable tasks? I'll be very grateful for any response.,Personality-disorder

50592,Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD I don't date much and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. Hes a empathetic person that cares for other people but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95 sure he's gone to therapy because even though he will explode at the most random times there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.Before we dated I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly a few weeks before he was flirting with me but I didnt pick up on it. So when I invited him it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter that I dont follow he was saying stuff like playing with peoples feelings is bad and disloyal people annoy me. The next several weeks he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.Hell also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really arent a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll.

I don't exactly know how to feel about it it makes sense all too much sense. I wonder if I could've turned out better if I had been diagnosed earlier since I've basically wasted my entire life so far. Only good part was some part of my 09'th grade since it was a private school that had good experience with a bit different kids not a specialschool but nevertheless a good school for me.ampx200BWell looking forward at least I have this diagnosis now and I have somewhere to start from. I'll be looking to get my doctor's reference to a psychologist to hopefully make some progress with all of this. Even though I'm a complete hermit who is not at all good at getting daily things done I do have at least a bit of hope of turning some things around I still have hope that I can make progress for the better. But it's going to be hard.ampx200BI wish you all the best as well from the bottom of my heart.,Personality-disorder

Almost got into having my own room but it fell apart before that. This is pretty much crazy but hopefully it will work out. Im on disability so Im trying to live somewhere I can get a cheap apartment. Its possible I can get a job to make the budget issues easier. For living in unhealthy situations I couldnt hold down a job. Im at least hoping thats the reason.

50751,Root of avpd and lifedamaging thoughts I had M21. My problem with avpd is that it made me weak defenseless I feel like prey living among predators.My self esteem is low and I know how it can be increased it just requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear.I was bullied by two different group of people I realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness the second time I was bullied by my friends at that time initially they even respected me cause I was serious but when you can't defend yourself it looks pathetic and I even can see their perspective you just need to be more tough and confident without any reason.This experience reflected in my thoughts I was living with till recentlywhen I was a kid I thought you need to really know how to dance know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it cause how they being so stupid could think about it really it's not possible but they fuck I don't.second was about clothes hypebeasts.I thought classmates were making fun of me cause I looked weird lame. Even though it's not fully wrong I just exaggerated it on a new extreme level. There wasn't particularly anything wrong with my clothes I just couldn't understand their reaction.Third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that I missed or like there was some hidden context I was unaware of. It was a constant thought when I was with my peers.I also has such problem that I often can't decide when I should feel offended and when not it's important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag. This is also a beginning of my PPD part of personality. This kind of thinking leads to paranoia.I hope I won't regret posting this. Maybe it's the only time I can be honest.,Personality-disorder

Now I've got more hoursresponsibilites the same days off every week PTO and a 2.50 raise!

I dont really believe that anyone would want to be around me or understand why they would which also clouds my view. I feel like having friends is so painful for me because Im always feeling like they dont want me around amp not knowing if I should just completely stop talking to them if we havent talked a lot lately or if any aspect of our dynamic shifts. Its actually easier amp less painful to ignore being lonely than it is to be confronted with constantly feeling inadequate amp unwanted.

51401,Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives listening indirectly to their conversations while in public being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost in a way that no one could see me nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.Some of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life just some sort of play or movie.These days I been having the classic I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog idea and daydreams and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature never having to deal with socialization again only brief interactions for let's say buy necessary stuff from other people which I don't mind. I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.I guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection where I could be myself openly and comfortably but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry. I don't have patience for people anymore I'm tired I'm being judgy as hell and I'm activelly avoiding new people.,Personality-disorder

51009,I do not struggle only with the fear of being rejected but also the discomfort of rejecting I don't know if anyone else here feels like this but I've noticed that the thought of having to reject someone I don't like is also feeding my avoidance.At this point I already know that I'm not compatible with 99 of the people near me I can't connect I have some niche interests and different beliefs and values compared to most of the people where I live.Finding someone I really like is something that happens one time in years and even though I know they exist it is very rare for me to find them.The thing is sometimes people see me being more reclusive and think is just because I'm shy I guess they feel pityempathy for who they think I am so they start trying to socialize with me but the truth is I am willingly distancing because I don't see anything in common with them or sometimes see things that actually annoy me but I feel so uncomfortable rejecting their attempt specially if we have to see each other a lot even If I know nothing that satisfies me will come from there.Because I have experienced the pain of rejection a lot of times I feel empathy for them or as I said for what I think they will feel when rejected which is the same pain I've felt in the past but I also think there's also a factor of fear of judgement and therefore rejection I guess? here because I'm afraid they will find me arrogant rude mean superficial someone with a superiority complex or just straight up be mad at me. I have this good girl syndrome and the thought of someone thinking bad of me is so excrutiating that just doing what is more comfortable for the others and not for me seems to be easier but of course it's not being sustainable on the long run.So yeah nowadays I'm also avoiding social interaction and new relationships because I know that I'll probably not like or be compatible with the person am afraid of being judgedrejected and also of having to reject.,Personality-disorder

50647,Can denying my sexuality be a cause of AVPD? So few years back i got AVPD diagnosis. I am now trying to get out of this rut and fix things. Thing is i have avoided everything all my life even my feelings. So its hard.One thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at 13 years old i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality. I only came out once i was 19. So 6 years i was 'locked' in avoiding being who i am. I am in my 30s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out.Is it possible that being ' in the closet' for more then 6 years contribute in developing AVPD? As i notice i still dont accept my sexuality 100 and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality. Thats what i did when i first figured out i was gay thinking that my then friends would bully or reject me...Any other gay people here who can relate?,Personality-disorder

But the thought of meeting new people who didn't waste years in isolation makes me queasy. Making friends when you have none just feels downright embarrassing. Reconnecting with people I lost touch with years ago due to this lovely PD is also mortifying. Sorry I stopped talking to you I took a break from being a person for a few years isn't really something I feel comfortable admitting. How do I explain myself without scaring off everyone? What if I do engage with the world again have a good thing going for a while and then just shut down again only this time with a new batch of people to disappoint when I inevitably ghost them.

51569,I despise my mom 22m Pretty much the title I just can't stand her I never liked her ever since I was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it.Just to clarify I don't think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if it's just the order of the way I put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are MY things she isn't satisfied with the way I put my clothes in my wardrobe or when I don't do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy In the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open even this days she complain when I don't leave a gap but on that case I don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kidspeople' because I don't act or do things they do and I cant forget her 'what you gonna do with your life play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason.Im afraid of embarrassing myself in public im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because I don't think I can do it or I'll make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how I was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons I eat in my room is because I just don't want to be around her because I will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it and my dad lives abroad my ears my hair my clothes everything. She always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever I want regardless of her opinionpicks I still remember that when I was younger she would be upset and mad if I didn't wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as I said I still wear what I wear and the judgement doesn't stop at that. Her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about the way I behave WhY YoU ARe NoT SmiLing and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. She would always try to buy me stuff I don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something.When I think about all of this and other stuff I understand why im so incompetent afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. It's not all her there are things I probably could've done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now I need to find a way to get back on track somehow.Also today I pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings I stored inside. I don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling.P.S if there was another post made by me that's titled the same blame my stupid phone for this XD. Im also sorry for possible grammar mistakes don't mind someone fixin them.,Personality-disorder
50782,Its impossible to think for myself. Ive always been 100 selfless. I put everyone first and I dont give myself the time of day for nearly anything. There have only been a few times where Ive stood up and tried to prioritize myself and it always ended in a dumpster fire. I always get put down by others and myself. I feel like the universe is trying to punish me for trying to care about myself. Ive been looking into what I want to do career wise and Im leaning towards my dream job and becoming a mortician. Ive never told anyone about my interest in the job because I know people will be very judging about it. I was talking to my mom earlier about career stuff and I got brave enough and told her about it. You can probably guess how she reacted. But she didnt nearly react as harsh enough as my dad did. He walked into the room as we were talking and mom looked at him and went She wants to be a mortician. He instantly stopped moving and stared at me for 2 whole minutes with this absolute disgust on his face. He already made me feel like a disappointment without him opening his mouth yet. After what seemed like an eternity he said in a low and disgusted tone Youre kidding me then slowly turn around and walked away like I pissed him off or something.People have reacted in that similar fashion to a lot of my interests. I know that field of work is looked in a taboo way by some people but I havent had such an unsettling judgmental self esteem killing reaction like that in a while. I dont know why it hit me as hard as it has but it did. How am I going to be able to function if I cant handle people reacting about what my passions are like that? Every time I try to climb out of this abyss I get hit with the tiniest pebble of judgment and it causes me to lose my grip and fall down deeper than I was before and the cycle just continues.I feel so stupid thinking I could pull it off. I actually thought I could go into a job like this. Im honestly giving up. Im just going to stick to what Im good at most of the time and just stay quiet. Im never gonna get anywhere in life without AvPD reminding me that all Im good at is telling people what they want to hear and stay in my room.,Personality-disorder
51465,The worst part is the lack of hope Im always gonna be like this. Even with years of therapy and meds even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing and anxiety reducing drugs Im still too socially anxious and awkward. Sure I can force myself to socialise but I cant force myself to enjoy it or force myself to relax and just be myself. The fact that this shit isnt getting any better no matter what I try is so demoralising it makes everything else pointless having severe avpdsocial anxiety really does infect every little area of your life. I cant hold a job I cant make friends I havent talked to a girl in years never mind having a relationship. My anxiety is so bad I get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen or hearing others use voice chat in video games. And as I said sure I could force myself to get out there and maybe make friends or a gf but I cant force myself to enjoy being around them. Id be constantly stressed out tense unable to relax. Id have nothing in common with them I only ever feel comfortable alone. Living with a brain like this is like torture craving connections and feeling horribly lonely but being unable to actually make any connections or function in a social situation. Im technically an adult but I have no independence I still feel like a child and I know for a fact that if I keep on going my future is nothing but boring bleak and lonely. Whats the point of going to an awful stressful job everyday if my days off are just as bad. My hobbies are just escapism I dont even enjoy anything anymore Im just so tired I really dont see the point in going on when my brain is this fucked up and my future is inevitably empty and alone. Im barely in my 20s but Im certain I wont make it to 30 its so crazy how fucked up i am avpd is so awful it robs you of a basic human need but still leaves you with the desire for it. A longing hunger that can never be sated the empty void inside my only gets bigger things are only getting worse. No heartbreak or feeling of loss nothing to even look back on theres just nothing. There has always been nothing my life is empty and always will be,Personality-disorder
51335,rejection this is kind of a stupid petty thing to talk about but honestly i just wanna get this off my chest. i have a friend we've been friends for like 5 years already and we've basically grown up together. we were both sort of socially withdrawn so all we had were one another and so we'd talk everyday all day. i remember this one time we had a conversation where they told me that they tend to ghost people and slowly pull back when they feel as if talking to someone starts to feel draining or they just don't like the person anymore. lately they've been pulling away like replying less and less and just ignoring me for the entire day. though sometimes they'd stay and have a full conversation with me but it's kind of rare and i get the feeling that they do it only to keep me there like to ensure my stay... kind of like a push and pull. it's not like they don't have time either. sometimes when we'd have a half conversation they'd always and i say always talk about how they're connecting with someone how they had fun with someone new all this passionate stuff and it just stings a bit. by a bit i mean a lot. i know i'm not entitled to their time by any means but like i just feel like i've been hit by a truck. i know they're purposely ignoring me i know they're losing interest in me i even get the feeling that we're growing out of one another. i'm just wondering... what about me isn't enough that's worthy of their time? am i not interesting enough? am i boring? i don't know. oh well shit happens i suppose. i'm trying to fight the urge to isolate myself for half a year because i keep feeling rejected by them.,Personality-disorder
50598,I'm not the friend people want. I'm not great at connecting with people. I understand social cues but I guess people find me weird or whatever. I will be there for people but they will say things like they feel like they have nobdoy to talk to and it makes me feel like I'm not good enough for them or the the type of friend they had in mind. It sucks but what can you do?,Personality-disorder
51456,Inner monologue is brutal One problem I have with criticism and people offering it is that I've heard it already. A lot. From myself. I think the worst things about myself to myself constantly. The other night I told myself that I'm nothing more than potential. The reason I'm lonely is because no one wants to wait around for me to finally decide to be a reality. Im walkingempty promises. That encompasses a lot. So when someone wants to tell me about myself it feels like a rerun. And they hate that. Hate that they can't get their issue off or add their redundant nugget of truth. Idk if that's part of avpd. And its coming off as arrogant. It's not the critiscm itself. I don't mind. More fuel for the fire. It's the attitude that erupts in response to me being unphased. I always feel like I'm preparing myself for the worst possible things so I'm not as affected when they happen. Being one step ahead of anyone trying to hurt me. Sorry if this has been discussed. I'm in and out a lot.,Personality-disorder

51208,Motivation Maybe I'm just pathetic but I feel like I need someone in my life for motivation. I once had someone interested in me I think anyway lol and I was the most motivated I had ever been in my whole life. If you're just alone it's hard to say motivated IMO. I realize this is probably a flawed way of thinking and I know that you shouldn't rely on other people but I just feel like I need someone to give me that spark. I feel like a hopeless romantic with zero romantic experience.,Personality-disorder
51377,Do you think telling my flatmate about AvPD would be weird? I almost don't talk to any of them but there is one guy I kinda like so of course I avoid him even more. Once in a while we happen to meet in the kitchen and he usually initates some conersation. He is very nice and I feel like he'd be understanding. Would it be weird to tell him something like sorry I don't talk much to you guys I have avoidant personality? Idk I feel like it might make him uncomfortable and it's kind of oversharing. But I feel like it'd remove this barrier between us at least a little bit? Idk I might be wrong.,Personality-disorder
51415,Feel like a leech Sometimes a song stops me in my tracks and this is one of themhttpsm.youtube.comwatch?vWjxIuZVgjp8.My mother would tell me Im exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. She called me a sociopath someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my familys lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldnt know about. Its been the foundation of all of my relationships with others and helps explain why I get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. Trying to connect while thinking Im secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that Im taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. That everything I say is actually calculated and manipulative despite me being unaware of this. That my side of the story isnt just shameful and wrong its evil and vile.Avoidant with BPD is contradictory hell. Im hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships I can keep so they dont leave me. Im unbelievably stressed because Im so close to disaster. I hate to vent to my best friend of several years because I feel like Im being too greedy of her time. I feel like Im sucking off all the meat of this relationship taking up the space for my troubles and then I dont even improve. I know shes going to leave when she discovers Im actually a terrible person and that I dont change. I can feel it creeping towards me and I want to die.I feel like shes only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like Ive somehow manipulated her into thinking Im a nice person. I feel like Im so much worse than she thinks. I cant understand why someone would care about me other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I cant believe the situation Im in. It happens every single time and I never learn.I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like Ive done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth. Everyone is sick of me including me.,Personality-disorder

50969,Dealing with rude people I started a new job recently and everyone there is pretty close with each other since theyve worked together for a while and most of them are friendly and helpful. All except for this one girl who is helpful to me when i need help but occasionally if she gets stressed out and for her thats pretty often she can be real catty and take it out on others. I dont really know how to deal with situations like this when it comes up because 1. Im in this subreddit lol 2. I understand shes stressed 3. I dont want to look pathetic in front of others and I want to put up boundaries. 4. I dont want to be rude back to her because I really dont want to be that kind of person but i really dont want this to continue. I dont know what to do I want to be mature but I dont know if a person like her would be very receptive to that. Please help if you can.,Personality-disorder

50778,I moved out. A friend of mine was talking to me about my family situation and I told him about how I wanted to put distance between me and them. He said that he might have some ideas and that we could work something out.I've been in a new place now for five days. I have a roommate he is cool. His work keeps me from seeing him very much so I only have to deal with other people in small doses. The best thing is that I'm finally away from my relatives! It always feels weird when I say I miss you too over the phone because I don't miss them at all. I'm so happy to finally be freed of them!People do keep telling me that it's natural for me to feel this way and that I'll miss them eventually but I don't want to miss them. I had to go back earlier today to pick up some of my stuff but I dreaded seeing anyone there. I left as soon as I could and I guess I just don't know how to feel now. I still love them I never didn't love my relatives but I know they're not good for me. I am much better on my own. I guess I just feel guilty like I owe them something. Part of me wants to go back and try to fix them but I have to keep reminding myself that I can't do that and that they're not my responsibility. So I'm determined to not go back for as long as possible. The only reason I'd go back now is to get my bike but I can be without that for a while. Otherwise I'm done belonging to them. I am my own person now and I'm slowly getting to like who I'm becoming.I definitely still have many times where I hate myself for messing something up or blaming myself for something that can't be helped or just wasn't my fault. But overall things are getting better and me leaving my relatives behind is just one of many steps in the right direction.,Personality-disorder
51340,Laziness is something we ascribe to normal people who just lack that inner drive The drive which most people were just born with. Dopamine cascades or whatever.Then there's us. The folk who just don't thrive on attention and competition. I absolutely believe we were born this way.I've tried and failed to describe this to so many psychiatrists and psychologists it's not even funny anymore. The schizoids call this anhedonia. Myself I've always struggled to orgasm during sex. We are OK. We're not psychopaths. We have empathy and we have all the things in place in order to love.,Personality-disorder

50977,I don't want to see her either! I lost touch with an acquaintance. Well she chose not wanting to see me because she sort of blames her mental health on me which I did not cause. I literally did nothing to this woman. She was into literature and writing and I encouraged her writing a little and we both knew about each other's anxiety. We didn't talk about our problems though. She shared she had social anxiety. She knew I had generalized anxiety but that has improved greatly for me now. That was the extend of us knowing about each other's problems. She decided me having anxiety equated to me being a negative person and that is actually not true. She doesn't even know me well enough to determine what kind of person I am so that is part of what upset me. The other part is just the way she went about the situation. I have zero interest in ever reconnecting with her. The trust wouldn't be there and I'd always be fearful of saying something wrong or of being hurt again. See it shouldn't hurt so much just from a little ol' acquaintance but it did hurt so much. When you live so close to each other and end up in the same public spaces at times it is awkward and somehow I feel like I am in the wrong for being there when I have every right to be in public spaces.,Personality-disorder
50620,Lack of opinion and interest in things Anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? New show comes out new game comes out new trend im always late to it all. I always find myself saying the phrase thats a thing? when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else hasI seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is I hate it and 10 is I love this and will skip sleep to do it the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I love. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times Im just not that into it as the people around me. One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea but like this happens with everything I tryOr when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just heard was a highly paid major without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking what jobs it would train me for hell whether or not I even liked it. It was just ok sounds good. One of the most important decisions of my life made in 10 minutes. And now senior year I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.Makes me think about how many opportunities Ive missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life. IdkI'm asking on this sub mostly because I'm curious if this is related to avpd or not. Or if its more a personality thing,Personality-disorder
50529,Does avpd stem from childhood trauma? Hi lovely community! Im quite new on this forum! And just wondered if the origin of this is similar to what people refer to as an avoidant attachment style in which a lot of sources claim its due to neglect from parents in early childhood.What triggers avpd or what is the kind of trauma that sparks it? From what Ive read so far its not something you are born with but rather develops with age?Please correct me if Im wrong!,Personality-disorder
50980,why do I feel like I scare people? So i am currently in college for nursing I've been practically a hermit of a stay at home mom since 2016. I thought maybe I could get past my anxious feelings of making friends in once I got to school but it's turning into the same thing all over again. I have in person class 2 days a week and I met a girl who was open about her mental health. We clicked and I thought great I can do this I can make a friend. We even exchanged numbers which is HUGE for me. We texted a little but then in class she went from sitting next to me to jokingly saying I'd rather be next to insert classmates name. Now I have tried to be chill with this other classmate too. We had a similar dark sense of humor but then the past two classes I felt like a third wheel. Like the first girl just started to distance and almost mean yet she asks me to study with her and the other. I am.so confused and also feel like they are pitying me. Like I just wanted to flee the class and sob because i felt like once again people automatically shut me out bc of my quirks. Idk if this is an AVPD thing or an autistic thing. I just feel defeated and alone. I so desperately want a friend.,Personality-disorder
51286,This Sub has become a blessing in disguise for me I recently found out that I have been avoiding people and things because of fear of shame and rejections mostly. It has to be fair affected many areas of my life.Almost every single popular post in this sub all the behaviors from reading it here and other mental health sites I find super specific to me.It all just clicked in my brain and ever since then I've been purposefully doing the very things that I know for a fact I have more than a significant chance of getting rejected or embarrassed. It feels like I'm trying to move a pillar from my chest and sometimes I just wanna die. But I'm determined. I had one major moment of rejection today and I felt awful one of the worst feelings. But I kept reminding myself that this is the way towards betterment. Facing my fears is the only way to not be afraid of it anymore.I have been feeling very uneasy but also experiencing a lot of new scenarios and feelings so to speak. I'm also very secretive and don't share a lot. The purpose of this post is also to share my vulnerability with you all from my main Reddit account. In the past I would've done it with an alt 100.I hope anyone struggling with this find some strength from this that would make me genuinely happy. Also know that you can also get out of this. One small step for you and me one giant leap towards betterment!,Personality-disorder
50715,Do therapists even understand AVPD? I generally like my therapist. I think he's the best one I've found so far. But today's session just proved that he doesn't understand. And I admit that my inability to open up is a barrier to make much progress. But I heard the same generic advice....go out. Meet people. Do something fun. And that's not BAD advice. Probably should do that. But the problem is every time I go out I feel anxious selfconscious and ashamed. I don't even think I have social anxiety. Shy but not on that level. I can handle BRIEF infrequent surface level conversations. Anything more than that is a nogo. So I seem more outgoing than I am. And it's like he focuses on my lack of relationships so that's what I bring up. I think it's because he's a solutionfocused therapist and he doesn't seem too concerned about the pastunderstanding one's self. Just do it pretty much. CBT. Opposite of feeling action. Which is all true. But honestly I isolate because I'm depressed. Which is why I don't maintain relationships or want to put myself out there. So I don't know what to do. I don't know what my problem is. I'm just over it. Older seasoned avpders if that's a thing any advice for me? Should I stick therapy out or just forget it? He's like the 3rd longterm ish therapist I've been with and I don't want to dump him out the blue like all the rest.,Personality-disorder
51445,Dating apps even harder with AvPD Disclaimer I dislike dating app culture in general. There's a hell of a lot more to a person than a few pictures and prompts.If I'm not attracted to someone then I won't swipe on them. If I am attracted to someone and there's even one thing on their profile that I lack or don't relate to then I won't swipe on them either. If there's someone I'm attracted to and there's nothing problematic in their profile I won't swipe on them because I doubt they'll be interested in me. In the end this leaves a very very small pool of people which I guess makes the whole thing pointless?,Personality-disorder

I hate my face and the fact that people can see me Ive been told I have a decent looking face and good features but it doesnt matter my own mental image of myself is still awful I think of myself like im deformed or have severe facial scarring or something. Its like an inherent and irrational feeling of shame and guilt a constant voice in my head telling me to hide my face that other people will judge me or laugh at me for how bad i lookWhen everybody had to wear face masks I felt great. I was a little more confident going into public spaces and talking to people because I knew they couldnt see my face and what I looked like it felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders now nobody wears them though so I generally wear a hood or hat whenever I leave the house it just makes me feel much more comfortable. I think thats also why eye contact is so difficult because when theyre staring into your eyes it feels like theyre looking right at you judging you theyre able to see your whole faceIdk why I even wrote this just wondered if anyone else feels the same even though its totally irrational and theres no reason to I just cant get rid of the feeling of hating everything about myself feeling ashamed of it all though mainly my face,Personality-disorder

I acted like I knew about it but I didnt.Like I dont watch news or anything so I am out of loop in lots of things that are happening and I dont care much about politics honestly.I also cant vote in this country because I am a foreigner here so thats another thing why I dont care about it much. But fk the thing that president elections just slipped through without me even knowing about them I found this to be ridiculous. Because it is always such a big event how could I miss this?I also missed USA president elections I am not USA citizen I live in Europe. I learned that Biden is president 1.5 year later sometime in 2022 summer after he was elected. I still thought that Trump was president lol.I realized that I withdrawn from life too much but it wasnt even my choice. It was also because of COVID and that government forced us to just stay at home. I isolated myself from other people for almost 2 years and now I am trying to go out again and trying to put my life back together.,Personality-disorder

51354,NEED a different career. Help! Are there any jobs that people are surviving with? Preferably something remote. I do play based therapy with toddlers with autism and my client is not doing well in a classroom environment that he moved to in December. There is a boy who seeks him out and tries to bully him. Yesterday this girl in the classroom confronts me about how his tantrums are not because he is overwhelmed but insinuating that I cause the behaviors because I let him out of activities when he is upset. Well I don't want to traumatize a 2 year old so I do try to be sensitive to him and his needs. I think putting a 2 year old with a lot of sensitivities in a loud classroom was a bad idea anyway. It is 3am and I can't sleep because of this. I need a new job I need a new job I need a new job. I just don't know what.,Personality-disorder
50690,Does zoloft help? I used zoloft for 5 days a month ago didn't feel a thing except an even deader libido and worse sleep. Just wondering if any of you felt easier on it during longer periods does it help with physical intimacy phobia and other anxiety attacks panic etc? I'm going to the gym and plan on doing steroids just to shoot my confidence and libido up hoping it takes care of everything but taking zoloft while doing that might be counterproductive. Just wondering if some of you had luck with ADs or maybe anabolic steroids?,Personality-disorder
51170,Please help me understand what I went through This is going to be lengthy and ahead of time I want to apologize to anyone this might be sensitive to. It involves an affair and I'm struggling to absolve myself for my part in it and have thought often that I might die of a broken heart over this. I'll begin with the story fully and what I need from all of you is help to see similarities in me that'd make me a BPD sufferer or her or what. I am so mentally screwed up over this that it's been hard to move on. I'm almost 3 months no contact as of right now.The story begins at work. I worked at a rehab facility in a health field. She was at the orientation for our first day and she said later that I'd caught her eye and she'd hoped to talk to me from the very first time she'd seen me. As I began to see her at work she started casually flirting. Once she needed equipment that'd take blood pressure and I said I only had my POX that does HR and SpO2 she replied I want everything with a look. As we began to really talk she revealed she had a husband even though she wore no wedding ring. I thought she was beautiful and she was very observant. Later she said that she noticed me looking at her lips one of the first times we'd spoken. It progressed to innocent things like once I'd said me and a coworker missed her while she'd been off for a week or so. She came up to me later in the shift and excitedly and red in the face said you missed me? When helping a patient up from bed she'd placed her hand firmly over mine as I held onto his walker. Little flirty things like this intrigued me. I know that I should not have proceeded but I could tell that she was unhappy and I did feel like she was truly deserving of more happiness. She was from Moldova and her husband was Russian. They'd been married for I believe 10 years and had a son who was 5 years old. I began to pursue her a little more and wrote lists of things to do nearby that were fun. Although she'd been in the US for 5 years she'd never been to a movie once in that time. I was so sad and just thought this girl needs to experience the lighter side of life. Finally one day we exchanged Instagram information and soon began talking on there. She wasn't quick to reveal too much about herself but was definitely initiating conversation frequently. As we began talking it progressed relatively quickly after a month and a half we were meeting for the first time outside of work. It was around this time that she told me prior to meeting me she'd planned to leave her husband and just be alone. I tried inviting her to a movie but she kept insisting that she wanted to come over to my place. When discussing this she was talking about seating and how we wouldn't be doing anything and all of that. I told her the TV was in my room and all I had in there was my bed. She was kind of trying to say that there could be no contact and all of that. Well within seconds of shutting the door behind her we were making out. For the entire time she was over we made out. She even shook my bedpost when she got into my bed. I know she would have gone all the way if I'd tried. This is when there were things she finally said that shook me a little. She told me she broke up with one guy because he didn't kiss good and stuff like that. She told me eventually that people when she worked at Amazon offered a threesome with her. I have no idea how that conversation even began. She began to sound almost manic with the things she'd say as if I'd freed some mind that was eager to be free. She told me once that she wasn't ready to date older men because she wasn't ready for that. When we ate tacos for the first time she said she was ready to date because I joked that all women like tacos and margs on their dating profiles. She told me there were times she thought she loved her husband. It was largely like a business relationship where they occupied separate parts of the house and just worked together for the practical purposes of a relationship kids home money. She even told me he had cameras inside the house that he'd watch and monitor. As I started to become more attached to her I became more nervous and more fearful. It was at this time she made a reference to the effect of me being her favorite person and something along the lines of she'd let anyone go before letting me go meaning friends etc. The situation to me as it began was that this girl was wonderful and I'd have been a fool to let her life go by without joy and happiness. She truly was to me someone very special. One of the first things she texted me on instagram was that she perceived me to be less happy than I appeared at work. She just seemed so genuine to me but as time went on I feared that maybe I couldn't trust her. She revealed a lot about her childhood but not much about the emotions she felt. Like I know she had a tumultuous upbringing. She literally lived in a village with a bed that was above a wooden stove that heated it beneath. I know her dad whipped her and her brother. She was unfairly responsible for a lot as a kid. She also revealed she had a bout of bulimia in high school. She told me they were told more often that they did something wrong rather than be congratulated for good work. She didn't like me complimenting her too much. She would try to change the subject if I'd say much to that effect. She didn't like when I gave her positive reinforcement either. Like if I said I appreciated something she'd say I was trying to train her. One thing I'd said I appreciate was when she sent photos of home. Like what she was doing or what her son and her were doing. I just liked feeling as if I was included in her life. I spoiled the hell out of her. I brought her food and everything I could each time we worked together about once a week. What happened though eventually was we had a night together finally a month or so after our first kiss. I did not perform well. The anxiety of it all and the feeling that I was being told when and if things are going to happen. This wasn't like I'm feeling horny and you are right next to me. This was I'm coming over this day and we're going to get it on. I'm 33 and my sex drive isn't quite that great and add in this whole complicated situation and well it didn't go well. This was the first time she said I love you though when we were doing other things in bed together. I became nervous about my failure to perform. I didn't discuss with her the reason or anything regarding it so that was likely my mistake. The next time we saw each other and I said I love you she said can we not say I love you so much. That shook me because I didn't know what it meant like holidays? lol I told her to not tell me how to love her and she accepted that although it probably bred contempt. Fast forward a couple weeks and we are in the car after work and I saw her getting close to another coworker at work. This coworker later said he felt some vibes from her too but once he saw we'd become close he didn't think any more of it. When I saw them two close I asked her about it. She said you doubt my feelings for you? She got upset and rightfully so later that day she was very panicked and called to say that she was shook up by it. Now our birthdays are approaching. I'd thought we'd see each other on my birthday. No we didn't. Then her birthday was the day after mine. Didn't see each other that day either. Then another 5 days or so went by and she didn't come over or anything. Just prior to what happened next she sent me the music video for Wicked Game. Paranoia took over me and I just asked after a day where communication was kind of lacking between us if she was distancing herself. She told me that no she wasn't distancing herself and that a healthy relationship is two people living separately with separate interests and coming together in the middle to share. Then she said at the time that now she felt worse and that I felt better. Two days later and she called to break up with me and said love is not enough. That was the blackest my life has ever seemed. I had never experienced anything like it. Like I was just floating through a sea of nothingness. The very next day she texted to say she still thought of me and that she was worried. I just told her that I couldn't help her feel better about her decision to break up at that time. Almost a week went by and she called me. I didn't answer because I figured if it were important she would have called again. Curiosity got the better of me a couple days later and I called her back. She answered and we spoke she said that she had to become better at disappointing me. She told me it would take some time to get back to normal between us but it didn't take long. She revealed that she'd written in the birthday card she got me but never gave me that I made her want to have kids again. She later revealed that she feared and projected that I'd be jealous of the time devoted to our children over me. The fantasies continued and she envisioned us growing old together and that we'd rest when we were old. She is a very hard worker. I've never met anyone so goal oriented in my life. She was truly busy and between her husband not helping her her son school and work she was truly doing it all. I can tell that my persistent need for attention probably bothered her but as I became closer I could no longer act cool. After we got back together she suggested we go to the movies. I was so happy to finally do something with her outside of work or just spending a night together. Some time to finally bond and enjoy ourselves just sounded great to me. I had a great time and I thought she did too. She said before we went into the movie that she was sorry and that she'd never forgive herself for what she'd done when she broke up with me. She told me when she'd broken up she stowed away everything I'd given her and deleted our conversation on Instagram. She also revealed that it was a time where she considered going to therapy or doing a virtual session. This was I think one of two times she'd ever say she was sorry to me. I don't remember when it was that she'd said this but it was either before this breakup or somewhere else in the middle of all of this but she said I need to love you less. That's not a good thing to hear. This period was probably the best time of our relationship. She even entrusted me to watch her son while she went to an eye appointment. It was moments like these that I needed where I actually felt valuable to her. I didn't think much of myself outside of opportunities like this. A week or so after our night at the movies she came over again to my place. When she came over this time I performed better but still not well enough. I think I went like 5 minutes and then just lost it for whatever reason. I'm not a very experienced guy and I never really talked about it with her because I thought she'd think less of me. A few more weeks go by and she says that she can no longer spend time with me after work. We'd have like twenty minutes between us after a shift and of course I assumed incorrectly it was because of me. I needed reassurance probably a little too often. I don't know if it was the nature of the relationship the first breakup or what it was but I felt on edge. She assured me it wasn't because of me that she didn't want to or couldn't stay after work. She said her husband found a innocent picture that I'd given her of me. I knew that a lot of what I'd given her was stowed away so I wondered how only this picture was found. He then deduced that I was a person on her instagram from my photo. She warned me to not text her and that she'd contact me. This went on for a little while successfully until one morning I sent her a couple of messages on Instagram. He was actually online on her instagram and saw the messages where I'd said I love you. She didn't contact me the rest of the day so I knew something was wrong. That night I called her and she answered crying. She said that he'd told her she was a bad mother and all sorts of terrible things. He also messaged me the next day saying I hear you are very good friends with my wife I also want to be friends. I told her about this and she begged me not to reply and to block him. A few hours later he had blocked me. She told me he'd even planned to send me pregnancy photos of her. It was truly messed up. This whole situation is I know. When he blocked me I wondered why. She told me he was viewing the messages over and over. She told me he was planning to tell his parents and that it would be soon discussed within the family. I never heard much about it after that. My paranoia increased. A few weeks went by and we had some intimate encounters but she still wasn't coming over to spend the night at all. I felt maybe that was due to my inability to really perform but I wasn't sure. After her husband found out though understandably there wasn't as much communication between her and I. Now I waited for her to initiate everything. I waited for phone calls. I waited for texts. One day she texted me precisely before I began work and I said it meant a lot that she did that because it was something she used to do. She told me I was trying to train her. We never had real quality time together. Work was really the best thing we had between the two of us. This is where it all began to break. One day I exchanged just a couple texts with her even though it was against the rules and I never received a call. I had a spell of emotions come over me and I got upset I said some rough things nothing too crazy. The next day we spoke and I said asked her if she was happy. She said if she still calls and I still answer that we're happy. She then began dissecting what I was really asking and she came to the conclusion that I was actually saying that I wasn't happy. I felt our communication was so difficult and we hadn't spent any real quality time together by this time since the movies and our one night together. She told me she doesn't do reassurance. She said she'd have to take time to herself and she'd miss me and stuff but she'd not really be speaking to me. The next week or more I just got texts saying things like I miss you can't talk good morning. This went on and on for like I said over a week. I was getting really affected by it. There I was the other man in this whole thing and I'm wondering how important am I? After all she has a husband and a life outside of our relationship. She was absolutely my primary partner. I finally got upset and sent her a text that was lengthy and said don't contact me I don't know what is going on I don't have clarity on anything etc. She must have had my phone number blocked because the next morning I received another good morning message. So I sent another similar message again. This one was delivered because she didn't say anything at all. I'll admit I wanted her to fight for our relationship. I wanted her to see how difficult this was for me. I understand that I was wreaking havoc on her life to some extent. I was definitely a hindrance to any stability in her life. Well after nothing came to me within a couple of days I freaked out. I went back on everything I'd said and apologized profusely and went on and on with a whole bunch of texts and calls. Like a whole bunch. I was so fearful and felt like I was digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that I'd been responsible for. I still felt I was owed some clarity on her stance with her husband and what was happening behind the scenes but I knew that I was screwing up. After all of this she said it was toxic and that I was frightening her. After she said that I lost it. I was supposed to work with her that night and I called off because I couldn't fathom being near her when she'd said I frightened her. Well that night she was super pissed. She said that I was acting like an 18 year old boy not a 33 year old man. She said there was no more us at work no more spending time together no more talking no more anything. I was shook up by this as I'd been by everything before it. I told her honestly that when I'd called off that my manager knew it was because of some disagreement between her and I. I had known my manager for years and she was a friend so I didn't think much of it. After she said all of this there is no more us stuff several more days went by and I decided to resign from the job. She talked to me finally a couple days after the day I resigned. When we spoke she said that her dad never understood her mom and she was fearful because I didn't understand her. At the end of the call I revealed to her that I quit the job. She abruptly hung up on me and later told me that she began to cry after I told her I'd done it because of what she said. She later texted me and said she wanted me to let her go. This where things got really messy. She told me she wanted to be single. I told her I need time to move on. She replied I will not remind you of myself. I told her she could write a letter if she ever had some clarity on all of this. She replied I will not send a letter I don't like writing letters. A few days again went by and I tried reaching out to her. She asked me what I'd done in those few days apart. I told her that I'd done nothing meaning I hadn't been with anyone else. When we began talking again things got rough she began trying to lose weight. She asked if it was because I was nervous why I hadn't performed well in bed. I told her that it was but she questioned whether it was her body. She talked about getting breast implants. She told me that the beginning was fantasy and that it'd never be like that again. She once texted me and said that she missed me more than I even knew but that she can't be vulnerable. She said that she needed to learn to love not me. She said so many things during this period that makes me question everything today. I know women can be emotional and I was definitely emotional enough for the both of us but this was next level. After a struggle to see her she finally said she wanted to see me. When I did I felt just as we always had together. The butterflies and like she was just the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on. She allowed me to touch her intimately when we had this meeting but it was almost the last time she'd allow me to do so. What happened in the weeks following was my job was reinstated because my resignation was never given to anyone above my manager. She didn't forward it so that she could protect my employment in case I changed my mind. When we worked together those next few weeks there was some contentiousness between us. One night she was upset because something regarding her parents' immigration wasn't going well. She did not tell me what it was initially. I always wanted to know what was bothering her and I was sensitive to her moods. My life with her felt so microscopic. Each interaction was magnified. Each gesture became what I'd live with for the next week as we spent time apart. I was often visibly disappointed when she would not share what was going on. She was very good at reading my expressions. She stormed off and when I caught up with her she had her pants hiked up really high near this one male nurse we worked with. I thought something of this because she'd said she did that near me initially when we began our little courtship. Later that night I said I wanted her to be happy. That I wanted to have a good time. She asked what I meant by a good time. I said that I wanted to have fun. That we never had any opportunities to just have fun together. It was soon after that I decided to go back to school to better myself and to impress my gf I guess. When I did so she took one of the classes with me. So we'd have Monday nights together in class. Our job soon closed because the building it was in was no longer going to be serviced. This left us only with our class together. She would never come over ever again to my place after our argument involving work. I did my best each week to spoil her. I made salmon salad that I kept on ice in the car and we'd eat it after class released. I got her a spa package to enjoy so that she could just a take a minute to relax. I really missed her. I really really really missed her. I needed time with her to really bond. Her life was undoubtedly busy but the lack of quality time we had together came off as disinterest to me. I became so attached but so worried about the previous damaged I'd done that I began to spiral. In the class we had a good time initially. There was even one week where he had cancelled class and we had like an hour and a half together. It was great. I felt just happy to finally have uninterrupted time with her. She asked me during that time jokingly if I had brought the salmon salad again for her. Also I'd gotten her a whole box of candies that she liked since childhood called Bounty. She asked where they were and why I'd not given them to her. She told me she liked seeing my reaction when I was asked things like this. When I told her I hadn't eaten them because I'd had enough sweets. She asked who have you been getting sweets with. I just said a friend of mine Will. I felt so awkward because she had not been paying much attention to me prior to this night we had together. Texts were more sporadic and often mine that I sent weren't replied to. We still spoke every day pretty much but there was never much to talk about. I craved shared experiences and a sense of security. I'd done my part to ruin things but it felt like this was all being sabotaged. One day I called her after I got out of a therapy session and asked her how do I ask for what I need? I was being starved. I felt overwhelmed by how much I felt I was being ignored. However I do know during this time she wasn't caring for herself much either. She was irritated when I asked this of her. One night near the very end I offered her a BetterHelp therapy membership. I told her it was the best thing that I could give her. I had already tried brightening her spirits with the spa gift and the other little things I'd tried to do. She said she didn't want to go and that only she could decide when it was necessary to go. She told me she didn't like how I was trying to change her. Another week near the end I sat next to her in class like always. After class she asked me why my legs were so far from her legs beneath the table. I certainly felt the pushpull behavior. I know she had a lot on her plate but I was single I didn't have all of these responsibilities and dramas. I was focused on her. A little too much maybe. I didn't know if she'd done this before?? Why the cameras in the house?? Why the invitation of a threesome?? I didn't know if I was really important. My mind raced and raced. One of the final days we had I asked her in a text if I ask to spend more time with her isn't that something she'd want to do because she loves me. The next day we spoke on the phone and I asked her to reply to that when she could she said that I can't ask someone to do that. She'd reply whenif she was ready to do so. I was struggling so much I have thought at times I might die of a broken heart over this. What finally happened was her son was sick she told me the day before we had class together that she needed a break and requested that I don't text her. I agreed and the next day we saw each other in class. I broke. I asked her if she'd have any time for us after class she just shook her head no. I snapped. I began just staring at her intermittently for a good ten minutes or so. Sulking in the chair next to her I was probably a real sorry sight to see. She looked to me and said we'll talk after class. I made some passive aggressive remarks about borrowing a pen and stuff but nothing too bad. When we got out of class I was immediately upset. She patronizingly said let's have a discussion. As if I hadn't been trying to have one all along about my needs. I said did you talk to your husband today? She said I have to he has my son. I replied well nothing for me then huh? The let's have a discussion remark made me begin to crack a smile she did not like that because I just thought to myself how ridiculous is all of this. I love her I still do. How on earth could she not see how ridiculous it had all become and how it practically was from the start. The argument went mostly like that for just another minute or so before she began walking away. I followed and she said I don't like the way you love. Your love is overwhelming. She got in the car and as I tried to offer her a water I had brought for her she said I don't want anything from you anymore. She had headaches a lot and one night she drank and ate the ice from the salmon salad on her way home that's why I had brought the water for her. She went home and I went to meet up with my one friend. I called her and left a voicemail that said something like I wish you the best in all the things you have going on. I hope you learn to love and accept love. The next day I hadn't yet heard from her and I texted her. When I did she told me that maybe a business relationship is what she needs. She can't handle arguments in love. She told me she went home had a few drinks and considered her husband's proposal to get back together. By that she meant they had sex. She told me that what we had wasn't special that it was in my head. One thing she asked was why I smiled. I said I couldn't believe I was being treated like this. She replied you're saying I'm a bad partner. I said I've been asking you for weeks to see you. I just couldn't believe the whole thing. She acts concerned about such a thing after admitting to having sex with her husband. Her mind truly was chaotic. Where was she when I was breaking at the seams over our lack of time together. We have not communicated at all since that night. The last thing I sent was one heart emoji. I had no words from her to say anything about what I meant. Nothing. I have cried so much over the last few months. I think often about the day that I die and if I might be able to call her and see her one last time so that we might be able to imagine what it might have been if we'd had a chance. A real chance. I don't know. I blame myself. I know that I might have a problem. Maybe we both have a problem. I don't know anything anymore. It was real to me. Maybe I was just being used? If I could go back I would have stopped it from progressing as far as it did. I felt my confidence and my security change once it advanced. I don't know what does this mean to you guys on here? I've read a lot of BPD NARC stuff. Youtube Reddit you name it. Do I have a problem? Is how I acted aside from beginning this affair in the first place that outlandish? Why didn't she understand how I might feel being in my position? Was this just a natural breakdown of an affair? Did I really mean nothing? How do I move on from this? How was this a genuine relationship with none of the healthy aspects a relationship has. Is it because she has a different outlook on love culturally? Is it because she sabotages relationships. I can't see how any intimate relationship with her could succeed there doesn't seem to be any consistency. I am so confused. Thank you to anyone who reads and dissects this whole thing. Thanks for any hesitance to pass judgement onto me.,Personality-disorder

Obviously she asked what is trying to get me as a some physical illness but in reality depression is trying to get me. I mean I really dont feel good I didnt lie its just not a physical illness.What I am suprised is that she instantly also said that we can meet next week. I thought she isnt interested and she is just messing with me thats also reason why I decided to cancel. I dont think that my depression will be cured until then.,Personality-disorder

51532,Im worried Im second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me and he asked them not to tell me but they did. When he found out that I knew he cut off all contact with me. Two months later he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it I'd just watch the videos.A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers but whenever I'd watch his videos a few hours later my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days eg. I'd watch his videos one day watch it two days later then the day after and each time I saw them my views went up and on the days that I didn't watch them they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year it was still frequent but less so. Now it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time he even posted a TikTok in English English isn't his first language and all of his previous videos were in his native language.TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.However twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up he started following her on TikTok but unfollowed her within a few hours probably because she didnt follow him back. A month later one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on he made his Instagram and TikTok private.

51193,Who else can't let go? Of anything. Of something that you told yourself that turned out to be wrong of something someone did. Maybe once. Maybe multiple times. Maybe ALL the time. Of the way you saw life for everyone around you. That on top of the first two.Who else just can't let go of someone. Or something. Or many people and many things.,Personality-disorder
50833,reconnected with a good friend yesterday it was really nice even though we mainly talked about tea lol and how rough life is i wanted to hear them out and it had been a while since we had connected one on one like thatwe ended up chatting for hours! just between the two of us and it was really nice i had never done that before with anyone except my family and my boyfriend. i think what made it better was how much they understood the hardship of justtalking about problems we both struggle with even talking about ourselves went through some real shit together and finding someone else we could really talk to without fear of anything happening was so relieving. they arent on avpd level like i am but they really get iteven though its still been really hard trying to socialize irl ive felt really good about my progress to reconnect with online friends lately and have real conversations more with them and my bf and its really helped a lot as ive been living alone and felt really lonely as of late especially with the rough time ive had the past few weeks. it was a really nice pickup and it made me realize again how secure i can manage to feel with the right people.,Personality-disorder

I have saved three people I called friends before from terrible terrible things.But I don't know if anyone will want to save me.I don't have any energy within myself to give out anymore.I don't have any resources material or otherwise to give anymore.In short...

51325,Resentment I have been suspecting about having AvPD for quite some time. Knowing that my inability to have close relationships and function in society wasn't just my fault but is due to a condition conforts me and gives me some pointers on what to do to battle it. I really really really don't want to keep on living this cold walledin hikikomori hell i was in throughout my teenage years and twenties.And boy did I gather all my willpower to try and change my situatuon asking this friend out over and over trying to send them memes to make them laugh and engaging with what they were posting. They ghosted me so I stopped reaching out to them. I gathered that they just didn't want to be around me. It really hurt and I blamed myself for beint unlikable and all. After months I slowly started healing back again and just... Moved on.Recently they came out as having AvPD to me and other friends and I now... sorta hold a grudge against this person. I know I'm supposed to be understanding and all because I've been there i am there actually but also... Fuck no I put a lot of effort and courage in asking them to hang out every week at a certain point I got tired of asking and being constantly ignoredrejected especially in addition to little jokes about how ugly badly dressed and socially awkward i was and how my bf probably cheats on me made me relapse pretty badly. How convenient to be cruel to the jobless lonely loser and then blame it on AvPD.,Personality-disorder

50583,My mom has Avoidant and dependent personality disorder and I don't know what to do. My mom is a very caring and emotional person and she's never been mean or rude in any way. However she never believes me when I say that to her. She's struggling with loving herself and believes that no one loves her and can help her. And because of that she has resorted to drinking. Because of her disorders she constantly bullies herself every day on everything she does and thinks she's the worst person alive. She's very sensitive too so one little thing can ruin her day and cause her to drink. My parents are separated but theyre both on good terms and still talk. On top of that Im struggling with myself too and I think Im stressing her out. I'm only 14 so what can I do to help her? She tried many antidepressants and other treatments but said that none works. Compliments doesnt work either since she never believes me.I always worry she's going to do something bad to herself one day.,Personality-disorder

Im so ashamed of myself but at the same time I have no motivation to change and am so depressed all I ever wanna do is sleep or lay in bed playing games and watching YouTube. Is anyone else like this? If you were and were able to make changes ie get a job move out was a difficult to make friends?

50721,Why am I such a loser I take online classes and only leave my house for therapy or medical appointments. I am usually too afraid to talk to people online even in anonymous online spaces. I've always been a loner but for about a year it's been worse than ever. Literally zero friends. The severe isolation has caused me to forget how to socialize and behave around other people. I get so awkward and nervous and don't know how to carry on normal conversations. Even the dialogue in my writing is unnatural and weird. I see people online and even in this sub who aren't total loners and have friends or even partners. How? Why is everything so hard for me? Why can't I just be normal and function like everyone else?,Personality-disorder
50725,How do you make therapy work? I dont know what to do in therapy we usually just sit there in silence as my therapist does grounding exercises saying things like notice the things around you your breaths all your senses etc to help with my anxiety and then she asks the dreaded question What do you want to work on today? Like hell if I know even when I do know I wont say it cause of my anxiety. I told her about my anxiety and possible AVPD which weve been learning about together even though its information I already know but honestly at least were doing something. I want to get deep into my trauma my mentality my thought processes who I am just everything about what caused this hell but I feel like were getting nowhere because my therapist doesnt bring us anywhere. Its like asking a blind man for directions. I tried telling her that I like it when she leads the conversation which she has been trying but in the end shes not leading enough. I know in therapy a therapist shouldnt lead and let the patient control their session but honestly I just wish someone would ask me a bunch of very leading harsh to the point questions with no way out so I can talk about my feelings without feeling guilty and selfish or embarrassed.ampx200BI know nobody is probably going to answer but in the minuscule chance that you do you have my Eternal thanks and appreciation.,Personality-disorder
50658,Quality over quantity Friendships I know people with AvPD struggle to maintain friendships and I do too. For me I think it's the daily or at least frequent messaging to stay in touch that I struggle with. I will get tired and ignore messages just because I don't have the capacity to engage with a subject that I frankly probably don't care much about or I'm just worn out by the constant interaction. The messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me. if it's a friend that lived far away then I'd rather not speak for 6 months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and fortunately I do have a couple that are like that. Anyone relate?,Personality-disorder
50626,How do you get through the process of getting a job? Im planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for. I shouldve started applying for those weeks ago but Ive been avoiding it because I feel like Id either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking Ill be a valuable addition to their institution which I dont think I would be. So essentially Ive been doing self sabotage. Now the problem is that Ive had quite a lot of absences at school the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. Ill need references for the application process I dont have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they dont want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they think they know Ill only mess things up. Honestly I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow would be a miracle in the first place Id somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again. If I dont go for this diploma Ill essentially have wasted four years of my life and I dont think my chronically depressed self could recover from that. Any advice?,Personality-disorder
51108,sometimes I feel like avpd is my entire identity I have to find a way to overcome this because it's not working. I feel like my identity in this world is shy introverted loner. When I try to break the mold of both what I and other people view me as I lowkey have an identity crisis.

50737,Sent desperate message to a family member and got 0 response. Is it okay to unsend it? My mother has a drinking problem. I dont have much contact with her as she ran away for drugs when I was a kid but have tried to be a part of her life now for a few years. She was in rehab and were now a recovering alcoholic and drug addict but then she called me the other day very drunk and it hurt me so much and made me worried. I sent a message to my family member who has the most contact with her where I said she was drinking again that I feel really sad and I dont know what to do feel helpless etc. I also sent something similar to my grandpa because hes working with her she lives in a psychiatric apt. Now its been days and Ive gotten no response. I feel anxious and regret sending the messages they probably think I was on drugs or crazy for sending desperate messages like that and therefore not responding. I want to unsend the messages but Im not sure if that would be acceptable to do or look weirder if I do that. Im considering texting my grandpa something else after unsending but my other family member I dont know that well and cant really do that. I realize I shouldnt text her again after this as its obvious she wants no contact and now Ive embarrassed myself.Would you unsend in this situation? Or any other good advice?Sorry for the rant.,Personality-disorder

50866,I'm too patient with my parents for their own good She doesn't deserve to ask for a hug and especially not in the right to pretty much force it on me while she says she's just stressed after yelling in my face because I made a minor mistake. Then complains about how neither me nor my dad give her affection. If she and I can agree the man she married is horrible then she should be able to look in the mirror and recognize what she sees too but no coz she's better than him. I'm only ever patient with her and when she happens to see what i did isn't to perfection I'm just degraded in the angriest and loudest manner possible and reminded for how i keep making mistakes. Then there's my dad who is an emotionally and verbally abusive misogynistic narcissist whom i just tolerate because anytime i say something I'm deemed too young to know anything or too serious.Even though I silenty seeth with anger everytime they put me down everytime that anger and resentment fades away I still go back to craving the love I want from them and loving them the ways I know I can that they will accept.

51327,Tendency to shutdown I'm sure I'm not the only one doing this but I find myself shutting down and withdrawing from people and situations to such an extent that I am unable to look them in the eye. It is triggered through different mechanisms but most often than not it is triggered by a situation in which I feel less worthy than what I already am.I have low self esteem and an extremely negative view of myself. Notwithstanding my past having an influence on that view. Some situations may come across as innocent suppose you were friends with someone. Not direct friends a friend of your significant other or a friend of a friend. This friend takes interest in you only at times where they are in your company. Or having a mental meltdown in my case. They never text. Truth be told they never even ask about you.Another example people ask you your opinion about something. You give it thinking it may be of use but then it turns out they didn't even bother listening. Or they brag to you about a choice they made when you suggested it in the first place. You feel like nobody sees you. Nobody respects you. Nobody listens to you.I withdraw and I shut down. Although I can try and look past it I can never truly get over it. It adds to my negative outlook on life and it breaks me down further. Soon there'll be nothing left to break.I feel alone levels that's been elevating over the last couple of years. I don't know if life is truly worth pursuing anymore. Any way don't mind me. Just another rant.,Personality-disorder

50568,The worst part is the lack of hope Im always gonna be like this. Even with years of therapy and meds even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing and anxiety reducing drugs Im still too socially anxious and awkward. Sure I can force myself to socialise but I cant force myself to enjoy it or force myself to relax and just be myself. The fact that this shit isnt getting any better no matter what I try is so demoralising it makes everything else pointless having severe avpdsocial anxiety really does infect every little area of your life. I cant hold a job I cant make friends I havent talked to a girl in years never mind having a relationship. My anxiety is so bad I get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen or hearing others use voice chat in video games. And as I said sure I could force myself to get out there and maybe make friends or a gf but I cant force myself to enjoy being around them. Id be constantly stressed out tense unable to relax. Id have nothing in common with them I only ever feel comfortable alone. Living with a brain like this is like torture craving connections and feeling horribly lonely but being unable to actually make any connections or function in a social situation. Im technically an adult but I have no independence I still feel like a child and I know for a fact that if I keep on going my future is nothing but boring bleak and lonely. Whats the point of going to an awful stressful job everyday if my days off are just as bad. My hobbies are just escapism I dont even enjoy anything anymore Im just so tired I really dont see the point in going on when my brain is this fucked up and my future is inevitably empty and alone. Im barely in my 20s but Im certain I wont make it to 30 its so crazy how fucked up i am avpd is so awful it robs you of a basic human need but still leaves you with the desire for it. A longing hunger that can never be sated the empty void inside my only gets bigger things are only getting worse. No heartbreak or feeling of loss nothing to even look back on theres just nothing. There has always been nothing my life is empty and always will be,Personality-disorder
51566,AvPD can be avoiding woman only? I wonder if avoiding woman can be AvPD? I have avoided woman almost my whole life at some point in high school I liked a girl I talked to a bit. But never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way. Its probably the only time I spoke with a girl. Mainly because I was invested in wanting to be with he but was to afraid to be with her in a relationship.If AvPD is not only avoiding woman for my instance then I dont understand AvPD.,Personality-disorder

It feels like if you want to beat this thing in some sense you need to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have. Life feels like a video game. Most of us play it on a hard difficulty and we are wondering why are we so far behind other people. Most people are the way they are because they are that way not because they chose and worked hard to be that way. Do you think outgoing social type of person chose to be that way? Maybe in some cases. But more likely than not it wasn't his choice what made him that type of person. But rather circumstances outside of his control things like parenting lack of trauma genetics.I don't know if I ever going to beat it. And if I don't beat it maybe I shouldn't blame myself.,Personality-disorder
51458,Why do I keep letting friends go It's not like it's hard for me to make friends but keeping them seems almost impossible. I inevitably just stop messaging because it feels too difficult. I hate that I'm like this because I desperately do need connection but I can never hold onto something once it's there.,Personality-disorder
50828,What's the point? I literally don't see a reason to continue living like this. I have no friends. I'm incapable of forming any meaningful relationships. I lack the ability to function in society successfully. I have no long term goals. I'm a burden and disappointment to my family. I live in a perpetual state of guilt and fear.

And before well meaning people jump in to say that I can't know that for sure or that there's someone for everyone... please note that it will not make me feel better. Don't undermine my suffering please.People don't fall in love with someone who's a shell of a person unable to function and express themselves. They don't become friends with people like me. But without human connection you are not able to grow up. You are left a forever lonely lost child in a slowly decaying body.There's only so much healing a person without a support system can do on their own.

No one takes me seriously when I say that stuff that's happened to me has negatively affected my mental health. I'm basically told to calm down stop worrying even if it's really affected me. Basically just a refusal to accept and acknowledge that I've been hurt.I think is partly why I have avpd to start with. I guess this could be classed as some form of emotional neglect not having my feelings validated or taken seriously to the point where I've had to deal with my trauma by myself.,Personality-disorder
50835,People get frustrated by me Do people get frustrated by you? I don't know why but I detect frustration when I'm around others. Sometimes I just want to move far away and start a new life. I just want to get away from it all and disappear. They don't accept me and so I just feel like I'm better off alone for eternity. I want to live on a remote island.

50661,I came off as an asshole today and Im struggling with it I went to the mall to buy some fragrances and I came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers. There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women and theyre all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions I wasnt prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didnt wear anything currently then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didnt really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.This experience made me realize that I also act cold and assholeish to everyone thats not the people I live with or my mom. But thats also the only way I can speak to people so Im kind of stuck between dont socialize at all or act cold to everyone.,Personality-disorder

Whenever I need to go out and i have to interact with others or when I'm with my own family i feel it. And i know that awkwardness is because of me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I know some will say it's in your head but no i really feel like my presence is just uncomfortable to be around. You know sometimes people can sense things? People can sense when you're sad or in my case uncomfortable in social interactions so they pick up on that and they aren't used to that so then everything becomes uncomfortable. I don't like this feeling.,Personality-disorder

I have vague memories of things that couldve went wrong looking back. Maybe some conflicts but its so unclear Im not sure. Is anyone else here able to relate?,Personality-disorder
50606,I look like how I want to. So this is actually something really positive for me even if it isn't considered the best thing in everyone's minds. I was going to the bathroom and I was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days. The pants used to fit me just fine but I've lost so much weight that I have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off. Anyways what I'm getting at is I saw myself in the mirror when I walked in and I couldn't help but think that I look exactly how I want to look. I love how comfy clothes look my hair is long and messy and I guess I'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. I am embarrassed that as a guy I like feeling cute but I think it's great and I've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. But when I was admiring myself in the mirror I lifted up my hoodie no I don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies the temperature much too hot for that as I can barely wear this hoodie and I saw that my waist was super skinny. Of course I don't eat much and I still function fine so I guess that's okay. What I'm getting at is I was able to look at myself in the mirror today and I liked what I saw and people can think what they want I look exactly how I want to look today and I love that.Things have really been getting better for me and though there's still plenty of low points I can easily see my condition is getting better.

People try to make connections with me and I shut them down or ghost them. I just refuse the effort. And it's not because it's unwantedI wish I had friends I want to date I imagine what my life would be like if I wasn't me and it looks like a lot of fun. I don't think I'm actually schizoid or anything. I just don't have the drive to improve my life in the ways I know I should.I have never been in a relationship but I have accounts on a couple different dating apps. I put effort into my profiles and then I ignore every message I get. When people try to talk to me in public I usually just walk away. I don't know why. Engaging at all just doesn't seem possible. It feels like writer's block only it's going to ruin my life.It's not like I had a traumatic childhood or anything. I wasn't abused. My parents weren't narcissists. I wasn't even particularly unpopular in school but even back then even in elementary school I would refuse any efforts to hang out outside the classroom. I would never go over to my friend's houses even though my mom always said yes. Most often I wouldn't even tell her I was invited. And then I would feel sad from the isolation lol.I don't really know what the point of this post is. It's more of a rambling vent than anything else. I need to get it off my chest somehow. My family is so confused by my behavior but I can't bring myself to talk to them about it. Somehow it's easier on an anonymous subreddit. I'm not even sure if this is allowed here since I'm not officially diagnosed. When I was 19 I went to a psychiatrist to get treatment for my OCD. I didn't want to but the only other option was killing myself which I wanted to do less. He's the one who brought AvPD to my attention but he didn't give me a diagnosis that day. He wanted me to come back for follow up appointments to narrow things down. I refused. I don't know why.,Personality-disorder

I also suspect I have autism because I did a lot of research and I just know my brain is wired differently. I cant hold friendships and I hurt them because I keep them on a distance. They cant help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low. Because of this I have a lot of traumas. When I was a kid I was neglected by my parents because they were addicts. I lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause I tried to commit suicide. It wasnt a serious attempt. I just didnt know how to get out of the situation. Anyway Im 24 now and Ive learned a lot so far. Between my 1822 I did a lot of drugs and I felt normal. I felt like people wanted to be friends with me because I was social and talkative and not scared at all. But deep down I knew it was fake. The friendships I build were fake. I tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in. And next to that I was in an abusive relationship. I was paranoid and stressed. Always scared theyd find out the real me. And I did this for so long I dont even remember who I am right now. I am depressed diagnosed with ptsd AvPD and traits of borderline disorder. I asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didnt think I have enough traits to fit the criteria. I dont really care about labels but I feel like there is something really wrong with me. Im an alien in this world. It feels so alone.Sorry for the long text. Im prone to addiction and Im addicted to Xanax right now. I get admitted to a rehab clinic this Friday for 21 nights and then straight after that to Portugal for intense therapy. Im glad to have this opportunity and Ill definitely get out of my comfort zone. I know they wont fix my problems but itll hopefully give me the push I need to work hard. Cause I do believe I can find out who I am and make real friends without being fake. I have hope and I want you to have it tooWere all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important getting out of your comfort zone. Do things that are scary. Take baby steps. Dont set the bar too high for yourself. Everyone is different so you cant compare yourself to others.Good luck everyone and just keep swimming,Personality-disorder
50649,I dont know if I actually have AvPD Last few months I was struggeling with lots of depression. So I started looking on internet and I found lots of mental illnesses and I really felt like this one is really matching my symptoms.Now when I somehow improved my depression I see myself differently and I feel differently. I had depression my whole life without even realizing it for me having depression was a normal state sme I had no idea that there is a nondepression state.But now when my depression improved I see that some of AvPD symptoms starting disappearing and I feel better.But at this point I am just not sure I might have it and depression was making it worse. And I might now have it and it was just depression all the time.,Personality-disorder
50919,Overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations Social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and I have to come up with responses on the spot. There is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations or when someone is trying to sell something to you.So before these situations I often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. This makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison.There are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. For example suppose I was buying something from a shop I hand over my money and then the shop keeper just ignores me what can I actually do in that situation? Call the cops? Get a lawyer? What proof do I have that the money was mine and I handed it over? What obliges the shop keeper to give me the item I wanted? Normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place they've never been burned by it so it just works for them. But here I am worrying over every little thing that I'd rather hide away from it all if possible.,Personality-disorder
50713,The hole I'm in is deep not sure I can get out I've always had a good amount of selfawareness but with that I can see the depth of problems. I know the minimum depth and it is already potentially too much. My ability to change is not as much now my brain is not set up for normal life. I've become institutionalized. I'm past 30yo I can't relate to average people I'm cynical of most and the ones I'm not cynical of want nothing to do with me.,Personality-disorder
50534,Do you think this a good description of our experiences? This is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called On The Outside Looking In by Daniela Grazia about her experiences with social anxiety. Ive used it to describe my experiences to others but I have both social anxiety and AvPD so I worry if Im not explaining from the correct side ?. Im also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two. I suppose it only matters in my head but it does matter.The quote one long one formatting issuesgtIt is a feeling that comes over me often an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die. In classes in coffee shops in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. It is the profound feeling of alienness.gtAt any moment in the group conversation something in me snaps. I look around the table at the other people blissfully talking and I do not feel like one of them. I am not one of them. I am different a foreigner an alien a stranger in a strange land.gtAnd then the urge to run away to hide to be away from the people comes up. Sometimes I fight the urge and stay on hiding my vast discomfort. Other times I do run away cursing the cowardice and the shame miserable in my misanthropy but secure in my solitude.gtThere is something in the faces in the voices of the others that I do not have. They are into the conversation. They live outside themselves I live inside myself. They talk listen and laugh I think listen and smile.gtThey are relaxed. I am not. I am never relaxed except when Im alone. Solitude is the only place where I can ever truly be known.gtYet I am not content with this. For the real me is lonely desperately lonely longing for intimacy friendship and love. I long to be able to relax to laugh to talk and converse amiably with other human beings. But I cannot. I idealize them in private and fear them in public.gtFear...fear drives the haunted mind. Fear tortures me gnaws at me and chases me from nearly everything I crave the most. But not even fear can conquer the longing the desperate longing the aching striving for meaning in life for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged the dreams unshared the life unnoticed.gtWhen I am alone I wish I was other people. When I am with other people I wish I was alone. This contradiction is slowly but ruthlessly destroying my soul.,Personality-disorder
50840,I saw someone I barely know sneakily taking a pic of me while in auditorium I'm currently in uni not doing well and today I decided to show up to a lecture a girl from my dorm who takes the same classes as me sat in front of me. I saw her subtly taking a pic where I was in the background and circle my face out on it to put the attention on me in Snapchat. I have been avoiding all dorm activities and I know everyone else have become a tight group of friends while I have been too scared to go out there and get out of my dorm room to interact with anyone for the entire semester. When I think about it it makes perfect sense that people find me weird and make fun of me. It's being the odd one out the asocial guy who doesn't show his face. I mean I don't even know the names of the people in my hallway. I can understand why they would talk about my strangness or see me as weird even be kind of disgusted by me. I am extremely akward I lack social skills I am anxious and get panic attacks emotional flashbacks when around people. I have no healthy boundaries and do not know who I am as a person have no consistent sense of self. To cope with all this I avoid all situations in which people could reject me or shame me for my insecurities lack of social skills etc. By avoiding situations I am trying to avoid getting rejected or ridiculed and deep down I know it's only normal to be frowned upon for being different or weird think about the fact that you can't help but look at someone who walks weird because of arthritis or when you come accros a homeless man lying on the side of the street. Your attention either gets caught or you try to consciously ignore it.Somehow I was still somewhat believing that I could fool the people in my dorm and hope they won't think of me as flawed insecure weird antisocial a loner etc. After seeing that I am indeed most likely a subject of ridicule mockery disgust etc to the people in my dorm I can fully drop my delusion.I have CPTSD and I developped my avoidance because of childhood emotional neglectabandonment and abuse by my narc mother. My brain is wired differently than the average person with healthy and good enough parents. I didn't have secure attachments in childhood and I am for that reason developmentally arrested. The people in my dorm don't know me and don't know about my trauma or CPTSD. They are doing what humans do pointing out the weirdness the odd one out the undesirable. It triggers people when they are confronted by something they don't understand or find weird it's normal they have their own insecurities and issues and can project all of that on the black sheep on the odd one out. If I had healthy parents good enough social skills and a fully developped and trauma free brain I would probably do the same when I encountered a weird person heck I even have judged many people for being strange undesirable or weird myself and thought I was superior to them.,Personality-disorder
50755,I cant do it anymore Im alone with my struggles and it has reached a point where its only suffering Unfortunately I dont really have someone I can tell this so this will be my venting space right now. The only thing currently holding me alive is my family. If they didnt care and love me I would have kms years ago. But now I really wish theyd just abandon me and stop caring because I really dont want to live anymore. Really I hate to say this but their love just makes it worse. What do I owe them? But yeah the thought of how theyd react if I did it is so bad that it currently holds me back. I do have friends but they either never reach out to me or if they do its in a context of meeting as a group and that happens like 2 times a year. Some of those people do stuff together I came to know but not once was I asked to join. And I have a best friend whos just weird. Idk why I even call him my best friend maybe because I know him since 19 years and we did stuff together he as well never reaches out by himself and when I do almost always declines is busy. On those rare occasions we meet I never get asked a question. No one ever showed interest in me besides my ex girlfriend but thats another story. I dont really have a perspective. Because I was lazy struggled in school as a teen I hold a diploma which is almost useless. Cant study but dont want to do the soul crushing labor I did before.If I want to change something about my situation I would need to put in tons of effort but my batterys empty I cant charge it no more and no one gives me a new one,Personality-disorder

51330,Disillusioned by therapy Maybe I'm being too critical but I feel like therapy has not been helpful to me. I had finally reached out for help just before the pandemic and was seeing a therapist. She was extremely nice and it did help finally having someone to talk to. When everything switched to remote sessions during the pandemic it seemed like she rushed through our sessions and sometimes they would be over in 15 minutes. I didn't confront her about this. I ended up just ghosting. I'm not happy with myself for doing that but it's part of this illness I guess. I then went through my local university because I had read they had a good social anxiety program and saw a few a student therapists again all very nice people but I still felt stuck. About a year after seeing a few student therapists I was informed my current student therapist was finishing their program and that I would need to find a new therapist outside of their program. They offered to show me how to find one on Psychology Today. I was already well aware of how to do this and was a bit surprised with how it seemed like they were just dumping me off.I'm 31 years old. It took me decades to finally ask for help. I'm not blaming anyone and I need to put in the work to succeed but I have to say I was a bit disillusioned by the whole therapy experience. Just being honest.,Personality-disorder

50849,Feel like a piece of shit I 23F dont know how to explain myself to the people closest to me. When they look at me they see potential and they figure I should be more independent. I graduated college in December and my family although they wont say it to my face expected me to land an impressive stable job right out of college but they didnt realize and I know this is mostly my fault because I never really opened up to them about it that my avoidance got progressively worse as I went through college. I never made any friends. Not one. Always too self conscious and awkward. I dont talk to anybody I met in college. I was even on the volleyball team and never got close to any of my teammates over the four whole years. Only kept it amicable and surface level. Always to scared to open up. I grew progressively more lonely as the years went on. I felt a lot of shame about my lack of social life and made sure to never really bring it up around family when I would see them over break. I figured all that mattered was that I get good grades and work hard in volleyball. Besides my social anxiety and depression would be so overwhelming most days the only thing I felt like I had the energy for was school and sports. I was constantly overwhelmed and didnt have the energy desire or confidence to be social. The worst part was hiding this part of myself from family. Always feeling like Im constantly hiding. I basically just went through the motions in college but thats honestly all I had the energy for. It felt impossible to dream up a future a career because I was just trying to get by each day. I would always and still do feel guilty for wasting my time in college. For passing up dozens of opportunities that were right in front of me because of my avoidance and fear. So its been three months now that Ive graduated and I still dont know what Im doing with my bachelors degree. I know Im letting my family down.Ive been living in my mom and stepdads house since Ive been out of college and I only recently got a job at a cafe and everyone seems to think Im selling myself short doing the bare minimum. The thing is this job was basically handed to me because my mom is one of the managers and they were desperate for people. I only just started this job and dealing with the customers has been hell. But I thought this would be a good way to finally step out of my comfort zone. Even if Im not using my degree yet at least Im earning my own money right? Wrong. It doesnt feel like enough. I suppose I feel pressure to live up to other peoples expectations of me. But I also honestly know I should be doing more. I should have a license a social life an exciting job more independencebut theres something wrong with me something missing. I know I should have more compassion for myself but thats really hard in the position I find myself in. Im honestly more frustrated with myself than anything. I feel intense shame about my lack of social skills and general fear of people. This simple cafe job even feels like too much for me because of all the interacting with customers which only fills me with more shame and frustration. If I cant handle this job then what can I handle? I feel stuck and hopeless. I think I might be looking into a therapist so theres that. Sorry for making this so long.,Personality-disorder

I remember i used to feel some type of connection with people now i dont anymore no matter how close they can be. Im never fully comfortable with simplest shit i never give out a true answer maybe i dont know the actual answer myself? Im talking the simplest dumbest situations where Im asked to express myself about a certain thing. I often deny that i have any problems with my personality and that i am completely fine and this is all a delusion in my head and sometimes i feel like this completely mentally broken person with avpd sa depression did etc!

50812,Recovered but it's too late I suffered from severe AVPD from my late teens into my early twenties. During this time I cut off my old school friends and then didn't go to uni. In fact I pretty much became a recluse. I eventually started to recover when I was about 22. I'm now in my late twenties and though I feel I've overcome most AVPD symptoms I feel like I am too old to make new friends. I've managed to sort of reconnect with 2 school friends but there was a five year gap in communication so things feel different. I really feel like I would've made my lifelong friends at uni but I didn't make it there. I don't know how to accept the damage that isolating myself during those critical years has done. As I've recovered from AVPD I've realised I'm not that weird of a person and I can actually get on with people fine. But those friend making opportunities of school and uni have long passed. It now feels like no matter how sociable or cool or fun I am it doesn't matter because everyone already has established friends from school or uni and doesn't want anymore.

And worst of all I have to be honest to heal. Im not even honest with myself. I just smile and nod to everyone. No one takes me seriously because Im always laughing and joking. I cant turn it off. Like when your parents say keep making that face and itll stick that way forever I got my face stuck in a clown mask.I feel like a shriveled dehydrated soul. Like a sewer rat crawling out of the soggy drain. Im horrifically depressed the worst of my life. And honestly the effort just doesnt feel worth it. Id really rather just rot and die.

50949,Social anxietygeared remedies and treatments have made things worse Trigger warning for suicidal ideation mention.Also long post alert. This is something thats been brewing for a while that I hadnt been able to articulate until now.Im 24 years old. Ive been actively trying to combat social anxiety since I was 17. And after reflecting on these past years I truly feel like all of the things I did to try to improve have only made my feelings worse and solidified my fears. For example public speaking I was told throughout school and therapy that practicing public speaking would make it easier over time. I was also told I would need to do a lot of it to have a successful career. So I did the following joined the media club in high school where I made intercom announcements and once made a TV announcement. Taught Spanish to children as an assignment. Took opportunities to read aloud in class and chose speaking assignments when given the choice. In college I had several mandatory presentations. I joined clubs and did almost weekly public speaking for various purposes for them. I called numbers for a bingo game for over 100 people and also proctored a club election. I then became a resident advisor which involved pretty regular public speaking. Let me tell you it did NOT get easier yall lmao. I swear to god I kept telling myself it would get better and waiting for it to get easier and it only got harder emotionally. I definitely improved my skills but every public speaking incident wreaked absolute havoc on my psyche. Like throwing up beforehand staying up and ruminating after shaking emotional anguish insomnia the works. Like Id argue it got even worse as time went on. No amount of praise was ever able to shake it and ive received some pretty consistent positive feedback. I have this thought of like probability. Like I WILL fuck up and embarrass myself during an event. And every time a speech goes well I feel like my odds of failure increase. Plus Im not sure how much I trust the positive feedback Ive gotten. I can accept that Im an effective speaker but anything more than that feels fake like people are lying to make me feel better. So public speaking hasnt gotten easier. Im out of options. And its frustrating that no one around me understands this because to them Im a sufficient speaker. But the idea of speaking to a group of people makes me want to fucking kill myself. Like every time. And now I have a ton of lovely memories that play in my head when I think of speaking. Like my brain has the motherload of material to make me feel deep levels of shame embarrassment regret anxiety etc. I wish id never started doing this stuff because now people actually expect it of me and I am haunted by awful memories that make me feel worse than I did before. I mean for fucks sake Ill get in a panic because I remembered speaking to KIDS. Six year olds. Who the fuck is embarrassed to speak to six year olds? Remembering things like this can straightup ruin an otherwise perfect day and completely sour my mood. Its not just public speaking. Its making friends joining clubs volunteering working the works. I faced my fears and they fought back viciously. And after covid isolation I find it literally impossible to force myself to try these things again even though I know Im capable of them. I just dont want to contribute to the material my brain uses against me. I feel full like Im out of storage space. Im just sick of the regret and embarrassment and guilt over existing the way I did. I feel like Im destined to spend my future disappointing people and failing. Ill never be like I once was and even if I do then it will just be exhausting and miserable. Right before covid I was reaching a breaking point anywaylike I was about to quit my job or get fired and possibly school because I couldnt handle the hole Id dug myself into. I feel spent and directionless. I dont know what my goals are anymore. I dont even know who I am because I spent so long trying to be someone Im not.,Personality-disorder

50695,What I see on Instagram IS real and it's killing me inside A selfpitying post for your viewing pleasure Stop self harming by stalking people yada yada yada I know!!!! I know I know better!BUT.I'm sick of being told they only show the happy moments. No shit. But they have happy moments. They have adventures with friends that they post every other week or even just every month and some of them even post every week or more. I'm in my early 20s and so many people I went to high school with are traveling the world before they're tied down with more responsibilities and their bodies fall apart mine already is.... Not because they're rich but because they're simply financially comfortable and have connections with people social skills. And because they're not afraid to take risks. And because they've built a life for themselves an identity since early on in high school maybe even earlier which makes doing all of this feel normal to them makes it all so much easier for them.And if they're not traveling they're still going on smaller adventures with friends and gfsbfs. Or they're performing in a band at local venues and they're actually good now. Or they're about to graduate college. Envy kills me.I'm so fucked up I took a gap year to figure out what I want to do with my life only to drop out of an overpriced community college this year because I still feel too directionless.And I know I could have at least a small chance at what these people have if only I would get off my ass instead of sulking. I actually just checked more like stalked because I'm not following any of these people Instagram for the first time in months. Hurt even more than it did the last time. And in those months where I stopped looking at their lives did mine improve? Did pretending they aren't living happy fulfilling lives by avoiding their social media posts altogether make my life any better? Contrary to what every mentalhealthgurugenius on Reddit claims no it didn't make my life any better. I'm still stuck. I try my hardest every day and I'm still stuck.Sure. I've finally had a job at this point in my life retail but I snapped and quit. I can drive now though I hate it. I can go by the mall by myself and do some shopping not that I have money to spend. And yet it's nothing. It means nothing because it's not enough. Not enough for society and not enough to make me feel fulfilled because it means nothing without other people.,Personality-disorder
50697,The Strip Club pt.II This is in response to another post about the strip club. Anyway my friend took me and paid for a lap dance. From this experience I learned something. I don't think it's for me. In fact I think I'm a sexless sort of entity like a fungus or a germ. The part on stage was super awkward. I ended up trying to put money into the stripper's fat roll because I was too nervous to find the strap. Are you feeling my cringe?Then there's the fact that she spent a lot of time putting her butt in my face. So the thought of buttholes was just ever present and killed the mood for me. I was also hyper aware of my face and trying to either keep a straight face or look impressed don't give away that I'm not feeling it.Then my friend insisted on buying that same lady for the lap dance. I was trying to politely say no but he didn't understand. Also he bought two or three... Anyway she kept grinding up on me. Now another poster here told me that nobody would be paying attention to whether or not you become... aroused. But trust me she noticed. And she seemed kind of mad about it. And I ended up being depressed because I couldn't help but feel like something was wrong with me. I mean not even a twitch.I was so relieved when it was over. And I don't think I'm ever going back. Good learning experience I guess.,Personality-disorder

50925,DAE overreact when they make little mistakes? TLDR I tell myself to KMS after making insubstantial mistakes. I could really use some reassurance I made a tik tok post about a band I like and I mixed up the names of the members misspelled the renowned venue they played at and accidentally said one of the members passed away. Two ppl in the comments pointed it out and now I feel like ripping my skin off. Instantly I started saying to myself you should honestly just kill your self whats wrong with you thats so embarrassing kill your self over and over. Sometimes I picture myself being impaled or shooting my self in the head.This happens all the time and its one of the most debilitating parts of this disorder though Im not diagnosed. Any time I remember something slightly embarrassing I did even 5 years ago I have a totally disproportionate reaction to the embarrassing thing. Does this happen to anyone else? I feel like Im doing much better than I was a couple months ago but this persists. I hope this isnt too upsetting to share for anyone.,Personality-disorder

I don't want to go much into details but the whole day I kept forgetting every fucking thing I was told. I kept zoning out asking a lot of questions a lot of times the same kind of questions again and again being slow because how much I was overwhelmed. I kept telling myself that I am giving it my best it's my first day and no one should expect me being immediately perfect in this but it didn't really help. I needed to do a lot of multitasking to keep my eye on multiple things but it seemed that I just couldn't focus. In the end I felt extremely inferior to all my coworkers. Whenever some of them would remind me that I was forgetting somethingdoing something wrongetc I felt so attacked crushed judged...At some point I even nearly cried but I could suppress it. God I hate this shit. I am aware that 99 of those thoughts I have are completely inadequate and irrational I am certain that they were just trying to help and guide me since I am new in there.

51462,Appearance and AvPD It seems superficial almost but my severe acne is contributing a lot to my avoidant tendencies right now. I'm doing everything in my power to treat it dermatologist prescription acne cream antibiotics clean bedding clean diet daily showers face wash etc. It just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst I've seen. I'm talking big red cysts. At this point I'm convinced my lithium is causing it.I was making decent progress too. I was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. I'm trying to work up to going back to work. But I just can't bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this. If I go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how I look and feeling gross I feel as though I'm doomed to fail. If my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then I pretty much have to bail. I'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. I don't know what to do it just feels hopeless. Between severe cystic acne and hyperhidrosis it is so fucking difficult to put myself into social situations. It's much safer to just hide away and wait it out but each day that passes is another day I've lost.,Personality-disorder

50759,My strange twosided life Hi I'm 25 M new to to this subreddit and also to Reddit. I am not diagnosed with AvPD so far but I am able to relate to almost all the posts here. My parents are loving but the rest of the family on my dad's side is fucked up. My dad and his siblings are all suffering from some or the other disorder Not all are diagnosed though because no one takes mental health seriously in my family. Everyone's super selfcentred to the core. But it is the exact opposite on my mom's side. All of my mom's siblings cousins and their kids get along great while I feel like an outsider.I was terribly bullied in middle school because I reflected the behaviour I saw back at home. Also because I had started watching porn. This went on for a few years. I learnt to build a shell around my myself to prevent people from seeing my true self. This shell has hardened to such an extent that nobody I repeat nobody has access to the person within. I have since been the mature kid in school and focussed primarily on academics. I made it to one of the best universities in my home country. A couple of years into university I realised that I had a lot of friends but there was no one I could truly call a close friend. No one knew anything about me. I collaborated with a lot of people both academically and in extracurricular activities but never got close enough to anyone. At that time I didn't think much of it mainly because I was doing well according to the norm. I bagged some great internships and a wellpaying job right out of college. Interestingly this did not seem to affect my job. I performed exceptionally well and received great reviews both in the technical and interpersonal front. But as you might have guessed it already no one knew me out of work. Again I ignored this and remained focussed on my work.Then I decided to go for a master's and got accepted into one of the top graduate schools in the US. I have completed a term here. I started noticing this problem again during my first term after meeting and talking to people. It's not like I can't come up with things to talk about but everything seems very superficial. There is no intimacy in any of the conversations. Also it feels like people behave differently when they talk to me.I am not really interested in people's life and it is extremely exhausting to pretend otherwise. What's sad is that from the outside it looks as though I'm doing great and living the best life. There are people that look up to me and dream to achieve what I have achieved. But no one knows the truth not even my parents. This post is the most candid I have ever been in my life. I don't reveal anything about myself to anyone. I have never been in a relationship and at this rate I'm afraid I will never be. I want to turn my life around before it's too late. I'm not sure how my family would react to therapy. I don't have enough money to fund it myself.To end this vent the details I have added in this post are not intended for bragging. I totally understand that people have suffered worse. Those are just to emphasize what an absolutely perfect twosided mess my life has become.,Personality-disorder
51400,Anyone else have nothing in common with other people? When I see normal people constantly talk and have fun with it I'm genuinely shocked. How the hell do they have something to talk about all the time?? How do they know what would be interesting to the person they talk to?It feels like I operate on lvl 1 of social skills while everyone else is already on lvl 100. Nobody around me has the same lvl so I can't even train to become stronger doomed to lose every encounter.,Personality-disorder
51106,How did you get a therapist andor an official diagnosis? I've decided to finally take action and try and get some kind of diagnosis so I'm not just relying on my internal monologue or the internet to deal with this thing.I tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didn't go great. After one too many what's the worst that could actually happen? questions I just really felt like they didn't understand. This was before I had the term AVPD to explain.My question is this How did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem?My guess is I'm being a bit too inmyhead about this but I just don't want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into WebMD and now is 100 sure of their condition. But I also get the impression AVPD isn't as common as some other personality disorders so I want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it. But nothing shows up when I search for therapists who specialize in it directly. Are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist? Should I just focus on a depressionanxiety doc or maybe one who works with other PDs like BPD? Or am I way off base and plenty of therapists will understand and just had a bad match for my first goaround?Any suggestions or anecdotes for finding the right kind of help are welcome. Thanks in advance!,Personality-disorder
50504,I am hurting Lately I just feel like garbage. I havent left the house much in like 2 weeks and I've been missing class. It all feels too overwhelming for me but being at home makes me feel like trash too...I cant win. I cant sleep right either. I wake up every other hour and im so tired....I feel so angry and anxious lately too because I feel as if everyone hates me and that they're happier without me. My friends hardly talk to me lately. I see them on social media chatting and making plans to callplay games and im never included lately. Im not surprised though. Who'd want to be friends with someone as depressed and broken as me?I want to crawl in a hole and disappear ,Personality-disorder
50804,Hey AvPD folks I could use some advice or perspectives Im in love with someone wAvPD due to my Pattern of getting attracted to emotionally unavailable People.which made me commonly feel unrecognizedunvalued in past relationshipsHowever I want to tell you people that there are a lot of different ways people show love and can feel loved and it varies from Person to Person.Now I need advice from you folks Ive confessed to my Person. The response to it was idk if I feel the same I need to look within but its kind of blurry.We were cuddling so I see it as a indicator but I feel that its difficult. Im scared of coming too strong there but not setting frames around it makes me also feel insecure.Should I try to look at it like a plain opportunity for my Person with AvPD to the experience of cuddling ?Because I know you folks may have trouble forming trust within possible romantic relationships and that It may take a lot longer.How ever forming a relationship out of it would take a lot effort and patience and willingness equally of both.At the bottom line transparent communication is always necessary I think wish me and your AvPD comrade luck.,Personality-disorder

You know nothing is gonna change even if you cure this sickness because you are ugly and getting excluded is a natural procces for you.Edit Posting something like this was a miskate.

51565,Is there anyone else here who checks off all of the boxes for AvPD but cant ever get officially diagnosed with it because your case just isnt bad enough? Im fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that Ive been able to match up to down to a tee. Ive went to therapy and discussed my issues but it doesnt seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.While Im fairly certain I have avpd my case is more mild because it doesnt completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young Ive always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didnt have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that Ive been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. Its a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I cant get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?,Personality-disorder
50556,My future feels so hopeless. I'm 28 years old my resume is useless haven't worked in 2 years and I am very avoidant of the world Hi there. I have been depressed since I was 12 years old. I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder afraid to leave the house by myself reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.Nothing really brings me happiness except substances and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and I've been mostly sober for a year.I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70 of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.I don't have many friends and live in a small town so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked I've tried so many treatments but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.And I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help that I don't know if I can find.Please if you can relate at all or have any advice please please respond. lt3 I'm desperate.,Personality-disorder
50639,I cant sustain long conversations It doesnt matter who the other person is if we are engaged in a conversation the longer it takes the more symptoms I get. At first I am ok then the worry begins in my head where at the same time I am talking I start observing myself. The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear my ears turn red my lips start to shake my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. Later on as days pass I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. After sometime I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. I am 56 and have been like that since High School. Some medications have helped particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes. This is all from times in my childhood where I was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts uncles grandparents and teachers. One of my grandmas used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when I did something bad. So for some reason now when I talk to other adults it triggers all of the reactions I had as a child when I was getting yelled at.,Personality-disorder

People reach out a little I either avoid it or get in the situation act awkward and get back to avoiding.Second year I get a nervous break down heavy paranoia and practically speak to nobody. People stop reaching out.Third year I feel a little better in a who cares anyway kind of way I try to act like a normal person again but people make an effort not to even come in contact with me.

She called me a sociopath someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my familys lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldnt know about. Its been the foundation of all of my relationships with others and helps explain why I get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. Trying to connect while thinking Im secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that Im taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. That everything I say is actually calculated and manipulative despite me being unaware of this. That my side of the story isnt just shameful and wrong its evil and vile.Avoidant with BPD is contradictory hell. Im hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships I can keep so they dont leave me. Im unbelievably stressed because Im so close to disaster. I hate to vent to my best friend of several years because I feel like Im being too greedy of her time. I feel like Im sucking off all the meat of this relationship taking up the space for my troubles and then I dont even improve. I know shes going to leave when she discovers Im actually a terrible person and that I dont change. I can feel it creeping towards me and I want to die.I feel like shes only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like Ive somehow manipulated her into thinking Im a nice person. I feel like Im so much worse than she thinks. I cant understand why someone would care about me other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I cant believe the situation Im in. It happens every single time and I never learn.I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like Ive done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth. Everyone is sick of me including me.,Personality-disorder

50952,So I just started taking medicine. Like I said I'm just now getting medicine for this. I don't think I really needed medicine but my therapist has been trying to get me on medication since last year. I finally agreed to it and I took the first dose yesterday morning and the second does this morning.I have noticed no changes yet but he told me that it could take a while before anything really changes. All I've noticed is how paranoid I've been that they are giving me a placebo. I want to get the pills they gave me and open up the capsule just to see if there's anything in there but if there is then is it medicine or sugar? Maybe it's just some sort of powder that doesn't actually do anything. What if they are giving me fake medicine? Are they trying to see if I can change just by believing some miracle pill will do something? It feels like they're trying to disprove my Avpd even though they were the ones to diagnose me. It didn't help that my therapist told me that he was excited to see what I look like when I'm medicated. What is that supposed to mean? I can't tell if he would just be excited to see me improve or if he is trying to test me somehow.I don't know. I think I'm thinking about this too much. Anyone have some advice? Kind words maybe? I'm going to keep taking the medication unless something bad happens so don't worry about that part.,Personality-disorder

So. Fucking. Scared.This isn't anything O new situation fear no I've been to the museum once or twice and know the people I know the community. But I am so damn fucking scared of rejection. I am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me. I am scared of the social aspects of it.I keep getting these thoughts of they'll think I'm a creep I'll probably never keep up with it because I am a pathetic good for nothing lower to everyone else.It's hurting me. And I need advice on how to just keep going what should I do once it starts? Fight through the thoughts and fears?It was already hard enough as it was to do the paper now I'm crashing wondering What the fuck was I thinking!? But I'm trying to keep positive as much as I possibly can. This could be a mix of social anxiety and AVPD running it's course but I don't know all I know is that I am scared and very fearful of the future of people of being seeing in public of messing up big time.Any words of encouragement or advice will help a lot.

50564,I hate myself so much I met this guy on vacation and we hung out for two days at the pool. I'm a very socially anxious person but with him I felt like I'd known him for years. One night he told other teenagers that he liked me. They told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriend's here. I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. I was bullied at school for being the quiet kid in class and I would run to my parents hoping they'd comfort me. But they'd get mad at me for being so quiet and they'd blame me too. I used to go up to my room at night and sing myself to sleep someday my prince will come. Now he was finally here. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and got mad at our friends for telling me.He cut off contact with with me. I was so sad that the one person who saw me for the good I have to offer still gave it up. They broke up two months later and he looks at my social media. We're not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. Im not angry at him for being loyal. Im angry at him for thrusting me into this situation. Im sure it wasnt easy for him but I was the one that suffered the greatest. He got to choose between two girls. His girlfriend is a victim too but at least he tried to make things okay with her. And me? I had no intention of getting in the way of a relationship.

Im 25 and havent had any proper friends for like 10 years.I know lots of people are in this situation but I feel like its extra hard for me because I am such a sociable person at heart and talking to others is the main ways I naturally feel happy. Im not confident but I have forced myself to go out and meet people but I think my personality is too weird that Ill never really get close to anyone. It takes so much energy to push myself and open up to strangers and be my socially awkward embarrassing self in front of people so when I manage to do it and dont make friends it makes me want to give up at life.I think about this all the time and never get any relief from constant feelings of loneliness and boredom and emptiness and when Im around people like working and realise Im not close to anyone it I have to literally use breathing exercises to stop myself from crying because I realise that Im a huge mis fit and the odds of me making a friend with my avpd and everything are extremely slim and I shouldnt have as much hope as I do.

51088,hi HiI'll start by saying I've been diagnosed with AvPD about 2 years ago around the end of my military service but it's something I've dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a 22 years old still. I'm seeing a therapist for the better part of 2 years now and it helps mainly mentally not physically yet as I'm not doing much spending all my days at home no friends no social life no nothing. I did get a job last week which I'm starting next week 4 hours a day cleaning some school buildings 5 minutes from my house.But as the time goes I find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff I'd like to do like traveling the world and studying I even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like 3 days before the semester started. Since then I'm daydreaming about traveling going to south america or something..Last week I said screw it and booked a ticket to Barcelona for a trip with my mom and sister. I was very excited as I'm a big FC Barcelona fan for years but as we all know something has to go wrong. We're supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days I had in the last couple of years. I feel like I just wanna disappear until Friday arrives when the trip is over. I feel like it's a task someone is commanding me to finish and not something I ever wanted to do. It took me some time cause I usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister and now they're thinking whether they should cancel or go and they're waiting for my desicion. I also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didn't know like how I don't talk to my 2 friends anymore or how before I got this poor job I was sending CV's and when people would call me I couldn't pick up the phone. I told her that I feel lonely even when I'm with them my family cause while they do make me feel good they can't cover up for my nonexistent social life.Seriously I feel like a mess I roam around feeling down like I've never felt before I think. Just want to vent a little ,Personality-disorder
50622,This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do could have been done better and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now during my clinical rotations every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve. I am always reserved and quiet and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However this has backfired on me as I struggle to form connections and networks losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible which makes me feel hopeless. What can I do to sustain balance at least in my mind? In addition to this I am lonely and the effect on my alreadydamaged mental health is apparent. Last year I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable and I felt liked. But in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable whether I had anything interesting to say and whether they looked down on me. The gutwrenching anxiety became too much to bear and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media I see how new people have joined the group formed close friendships and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this mysterious aura around me but after a few more dates I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.I'm sorry if I went on for too long or sounded negative but I really needed to share my thoughts and emotions with those who can understand. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.,Personality-disorder
50820,why am i so scared of being seen? i cant tell if its avoidant personality disorder or body dysmorphia or a sick combination of both but i highly suspect i suffer from avpd. it just all makes so much fucking sense too much honestly and it hurts to think that life will always be this painful. i feel like theres nothing i can do about it. ive always said i feel like an alien. that i feel like i experience being a human differently than everyone else is. because if everyone else was hurting as much as me no way theyd be able to keep it to themselves. everyone would be crying all the time. and theyre not. so i must be the weird one. i have these online friends i wanna meet known them for 11 years and they only live a few hours away. theyve expressed interest several times and im just this freak who cant leave the house. the thought of them looking at me terrifies me. theyve seen me through a phone screen but what if in person im too ugly? realistically i know they wouldnt suddenly turn on me and start bullying or anything but the idea that the thought still might pop into their heads something along the lines of oh disappointing or at least i dont look like that its too much. its painful to think about. theres one friend who is pretty special to me. we met as kids through an online game had a little flirtycrushpuppy love thing going on for a while but we grew up and didnt stay as close through the years just checking in here or there but lately they have become one of the most important people ever to me. and those dumb childish feelings started coming back only now i think its evolved into something more and i seriously have been hopelessly pining after them for the past 3 years or so recently they said they liked me. took me COMPLETELY by surprise as i had been trying and failing miserably to get over them. so this should be great news. but nothing can happen now. we just expressed our mutual like and now we flirt a little here and there but they said they dont think they can be in a romantic relationship right now yet they keep initiating all of the flirting and they mentioned how its hard not seeing me because if we could hang out things would be easier. which makes a lot of fucking sense. but this is also all very confusing. im stuck. im terrified. im ugly theyve seen my face and know that im fat but theyve never really SEEN me. not fully. not from every angle. not up close. not in person. im anticipating the rejection the disgust and its too much i wanna hold onto this idea in my head of us living happily ever after. and changing the relationship will probably end in disaster. they said they need my friendship and that theyre scared this could ruin things. im scared too. im scared theyll see me and any feelings of like will fade completely. and if i tell them this im scared it will only speed up the process. they talk about wanting to kiss me and things like that and ive never done anything with anyone. 12 yr old me is freaking out i always hoped they would be my first back then lmao so many firsts i wanna have and im scared it will mean too much to me and not them. how do i express this? do i even try? how the FUCK do i get over this and go see them? i need to see them. i need them. i need i need i need i need help. can anyone talk to me?,Personality-disorder
50870,I really miss having friends I think about old friends every single day always reminiscing about the good old days where I used to have people that liked me and I used to laugh a lot and make memories I've never since forgotten. I regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends I haven't spoken to in over a decade making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore. The only times I've ever been truly happy was just being one of the guys where I was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason I couldn't quite understand. And I just pushed everyone away assuming they all secretly hated me with absolutely evidence to support that claim. Then I spend the rest of my life thinking about them every day hoping some day they might still think of me and reach out cause I definitely am not the one to do it first. I haven't had a friend in years now and my life feels so empty without them they really do fill a massive gap in my life. Feeling wanted and liked by others is the best thing I've ever felt but it never lasts long before they see how really odd I am and a distance starts forming.Anyway sorry for the rant just having one of those days that even though it's exactly the same as every other day it also just feels worse for some unknown reason.,Personality-disorder

51370,Is it ok to only answer questions in messages? Whenever I see a '?' in a text or instant message I know I must answer it otherwise it will seem rude. That to me is simple. The problem I have is if someone follows it up with a comment. Is it rude to just leave it on read? Sometimes I will want to reply or add something to it but I worry it will prolong the conversation and make it harder to finish it. I could say something simple like 'yes' or 'definitely' but it sounds kinda lazy to communicate like that like.I just left someone on read after their comment and can't help but think I should have made a short reply just to acknowledged it at least.,Personality-disorder
50617,Need to vent. I have had a partner for 4 years. Its a shock to me as well. But we havent had the greatest past. To make a very long story short When he started medical school 4 years ago when we first started dating he wasnt that nice to me. Some might say he was abusive towards me especially when he drank. Anyway he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.Now my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still havent let go of the past. And the truth is neither have I. Ive forgiven my partner but I havent forgotten how everyone else treated me even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school seek any professional or academic opportunities but mainly it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply dont trust anyone anymore. Today my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents and his friends were already there since theyre in the same class. Keep in mind that I havent seen anyone in about 23 years. After panicking for a week before the event I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself its not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot as well. Well.Aside from my partner everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke they wouldnt acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light so he didnt confront anyone. He did stick by my side so I was at least grateful for that. It all just augmented my social anxiety avoidant personality and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me. Im really struggling to decide if its just a bad day or if Im really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that hes grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes ideally we wouldve never had to go through our dark phase. But hes helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me. They have no idea what their rejection does to me.,Personality-disorder
51328,Negative selfcenteredness This applies to social anxiety disorder and many other mental illnesses but if the sense of self is so negative it also creates a negative perception of other people and applies it back onto oneself as the center object even if selfesteem is low and esteem for others is idealized. It's important to teach people to have positive selfesteem regardless of what other people but also to challenge the perceptions of other people in the first place.,Personality-disorder

Deleted the channel and all videos.Had an account on an art website where I spent countless hours sharing art I spent countless hours on everyday. Deleted it. It had the only copies of my art. Last time I sketched was 2019.Used to game for hours everyday. Deleted all my games and got rid of my console and TV.Used to play instruments working on an album. Got rid of the instruments and the songs 100. Tried a dating app outta curiosity got matches. Blocked them deleted the app.Got interviews for my dream companies. Declined them.Used to love books reading entire novels front to back in one sitting. Now my mind goes blank when I see blocks of text.

Quit all sports and haven't been to the gym in 3 years.Having stupid mini anxiety attacks because I'm scared my avoidance of everything is catching up to me and I'll be homeless.Saving as much money as I can because I refuse to believe I actually have a job or deserve one.

I've somehow managed to have sex with multiple different people yet every time I feel wayyyyyyyy too anxious to actually enjoy any of the pleasure and instead delegate myself to please my partner instead. When I think about sex it seems appealing but whenever I actually get to have it I can't help but panic and be scared that I'm not good enough for them... Is this normal? Can anyone else relate?

51084,how are some people able to not care so much? if they miss work if theyre late to an event if someone or other is upset with them some people dont let that shit get them down. but for me it turns into a selfhating spiral of why I cant function.do you relate to holding onto and beating yourself up for small personal failures?while Im here I have one other question. I notice my emotions and my reaction to my emotions is extremely dependent on my immediate environment. that is to say I dont take discomfort well at all. I dont cope with thoughts like it will be over soon next time wont be so bad because I cant get myself out of the suffering of the here and now. for my life this makes working hard which makes money hard which lends itself to the spiral of worthlessness.I abuse dissociative drugs for this reason its the only possible way to escape the reality of the present which is often uncomfortable. the dxm actually not only pulls me away but allows me to see things objectively and see the beauty and humor in life how small I am and how big everything else is things like that.I dont mean to derail I know its not a drug sub. but so do you find your emotions to be a direct reaction of the environment around you so much so that you cant avoid them and spend much of your life actively suffering like me?sorry if this post is stupid and if you do.,Personality-disorder
50860,small victories Ive been secretly struggling with avpd for years I couldnt even tell you when it began. What I do know is it started out as severe social anxiety and has gotten progressively worse as times passed. I have panic attackstrouble sleeping nearly every day and feel like Im incapable of doing anything 99 of the time. Ive never told anyone about my struggles. Today I started online college and signed up for betterhelp therapy through my school. Im absolutely terrified for this journey but Im proud of myself for pushing myself to get here. As someone whos struggled to commit to a careerobligations and take initiative with anything this is huge for me.

I like drawing and cooking sweets like cakes cookies muffins and etc. I do have some passions and I'd love to improve my skills and spend my entire time doing this. But I avoid even thinking about going to university because that immediately settles negative thoughts in my rotten brain. What if I embarrass myself yet again?If I am not immediately good at this what's the point of all that?This is gonna be more stressful and exhausting than enjoyable..and so on and so on. I think I do have some sort of potential but I refuse to live up to it. So many obstacles and curves on this path it feels like I am going to fail and eventuality quit at the very start.

51144,DAE have depressivezero motivation to do anything when alone i just want to sleep but i never feel rested and recovered i really want to make music but im only motivated around others i have some intrinsic motivation such as to make music but i keep getting discouraged to the utmost point by a lot of stuff dreaming of playing at festivals and having fun with people and then feeling like its just an impossible task to even try to start and to mention transgender trauma its just not easy to interact with others and its always this doom and gloom there is no time wasted time feeling of society and its machine of productivity. i like being productive but i hate the pressure. and if i dont feel motivated pressure is the alternative response. kind and caring encouragement gives me space to debate when people dont want to debate it which kindof makes sense my point is im sad. i can't live in a 2D world IRL where i dont get misgendered and using the internet just to feel a sense of alleviation from dysphoria is fake because anyone can fake anything on the internet i wanted it to feel real as i could and i lost my insurance this is giving me a headache.

51483,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned in a western country and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling...

All my life since I was a little I've been incredibly distressed and downtrodden and broken inside. Been longing for a break from all the misery but it has never occurred.

Either way I welcome it.,Personality-disorder
51035,Why can't I do just one thing? So I've posted here before but here we go againI work on hobbies skills and side hustles very intensely but never intensely enough to do anything with them. I have a degree in music education so I'm really really good at researching and breaking things down to the fundamental level in which I can learn them effectively. I am capable of picking things up very quickly. It's almost like the huge dramatic improvements you make at the beginning of a skill or hobby give me the validation that I crave.The problem comes when I hit a plateau in improvement. These plateaus where you stop making huge dramatic improvements happen naturally. Due to my super sick AvPD tendencies this plateau is perceived as invalidation and rejection. I'm aware of how ridiculous it is but it continues to happen. At this point I basically ghost the hobby and start with something old or new. Whether or not I retain the knowledge from my fixation is anyone's guess.What should happen at these points of plateau is thoughtful consistency. If you continue to chip away those vast improvements will happen but over a larger timespan. I am unable to achieve that consistency because my AvPD tendencies make it extremely difficult to get past the first plateau of any skill.Ideally I wish I could just spend months and months even years fixating on doing just one thing so that I can actually see these trees bear fruit.Here are a few examples of what I mean ContemporaryJazz saxophonebass. Have the skillsknowledge in order to play and make a nice amount of cash gigging or playing weddings. Can't use these skills because I lack the consistency to go to jam sessions monthly network and learn the songs necessary to operate in these settings. The intense social aspect of the jazzcontemporary music scene also triggers my AvPD tendencies.YoutubeVideo EditingContent Creation Built a youtube channel totally unrelated to music from nothing to monetized in less than a year with almost 100000 views. Lots of potential for growth. I taught myself and know my away around Photoshop Premiere Pro After Effects with knowledge of basic filmmakingediting techniques audio engineering etc. Again I wish I could just completely no life this and make it blow up cause I know I could.ProgrammingTech I've taught myself in a short time frame a lot about programming as well as the industry best practices and standards. I know for a fact that if I could just do this every day consistently I could turn it in to a career.I wish I could just pick one of these things and go hard at it every single day.,Personality-disorder
51378,I'm your schizoid neighbour hi! I don't know what's like in here but on rschizoid AvPD is discussed very often. All sorts of questions and discussions because we avoid people as well but for another reason so we always have someone asking if they are schizoid or AvPD and what the differences are.Anyways I was very curious to come check you all and I'd like to know this nothing complex what's your favorite hobby? Plus do you you feel like you would have different hobbies if you didn't avoid people? If so what would you love to do? Share your dreams!I go first I can spend an entire day just looking at a wall I don't have hobbies. My schizo side doesn't stop at my schizoid personality so I can't speak for the entire schizoid sub but if you check there you'll see that we don't like much stuff music is almost an unanimity but besides that... you won't find much so I'm always curious to know what people likes it fascinates me.,Personality-disorder

50930,Does anyone else ever live vicariously through other people's social media? Sometimes I find myself going through people's Facebook profiles usually it starts with someone I'm friends with then one of their friends then someone tagged in one of their photos and before you know it I'm looking at this totally random person's life. And I'm seeing all the good times they've had the relationships the weddings the vacations.And it makes me wonder if I could have been their friend or if I could have been doing those things with them. Sometimes I'll think back to what I was doing at the time the post was made or the photo was taken and find myself comparing my empty life to theirs. It makes me feel like shit and yet I can't stop doing it.Does anyone else do this?I don't think it's really the traditional FOMO that people often feel when engaging in social media posts because I'm not sad about other people doing something without me right now so much as a broader envy of their life in general. It's not envy of someone posting pics of their nice car or fancy hotel room on Instagram it's not the heavily curated photoshopped influencer stuff. It's envy of people who went backpacking with friends one summer in college. It's envy of people watching the Super Bowl together. It's envy of people falling asleep on the couch with their partner while their kids are going wild playing with their new toys on Christmas morning. Things money can't buy.

50793,Discovering this AvPD has been a massive relief. Hoping to spread some positivity.I've spent so long thinking there's something wrong with me and constantly questioning why I can't just find things as easy as everyone else seems to do. Why I can't just be normal? Learning about social anxiety was a help but even then it was like It can't just be that though? and then thinking I must be autistic or have adhd in some regard but never really feeling like I fit into those things.To actually have a name for it and relate to so much of what people post on here it's kind of a relief to know that there's some reason that I'm actually like this and just knowing that this is why. I won't use it as an excuse and I'm going to fight against its tendencies as much as I can but I'm just glad that I finally understand now. I appreciate you all being here. ,Personality-disorder
51309,I fear I'll never be loved the way I wantneed to be I have this deep longing to be loved by someone who also has AvPD like me who knows and understands so incredibly well about what it's like to be me because we have very similar if not even the same upbringing and experiences that led to us being the people we are today. By this I mean I always think about whether I'll ever meet and get to love and be loved by someone that not only shares the same thoughts and feelings about most things because relationship compatibility but also shares the same traumas. I even maladaptive daydream and have intimate conversations with this nonexistent person about my life and they always meet it with patience and understanding because they're genuinely a good person and they also know firsthand what i am talking about and how I feel.I don't think I would ever go out of my way to search for people who has gone through the same things as I because I'm just not gonna make a post anywhere or go on some friendrelationship making app with a bio saying about what I've been through because I don't want to lay it all out there just like that because that's inappropriate and that I just wouldn't want to open up that way. I would want a gradual relationship to blossom from being vulnerable and building intimacy after a considerable period of time before talking too deep into the worse aspects of my life ya know? As someone with trust issues I need time to be sure i can share all of that.I'm always thinking and hoping that maybe one day I would meet a special someone that would for once make me feel I am loved because they don't have to try to understand but because they just do. I speak from a place that whenever I have spoken and been vulnerable about what I think or feel about anything they don't agree with or understand I often receive a response that makes me feel belittled misunderstood and disrespected. From familial to platonic to romantic relationships I never have felt I am seen or heard with love and patience unless it's something they believe and or know about rather I am scolded or looked at in skepticism or blatantly insulted for merely sharing something as little as expressing an opinion which always comes from a place of being respectful. To even expressing an interest of mine which comes from a place of love and passion gets mocked and made fun of.The very few people I would consider close in my life don't make me feel loved. Sure I feel cared about at times such as my parents providing for me cared for in times when friends would reach out and ask about how I'm doing and cared that I get to have consistent affectionate and attention from my romantic relationship. And yet these people have hurt me and whenever I've told them that they have hurt me they either dismiss my vulnerability of communicating my needs and wants which should be taken as a damn compliment I even talk to them to just being downright disrespectful to me. I thought they loved me. You don't hurt the people you love. I always end up ending the conversation and changing topic by telling them it's fine or nvm or I'll get over it or the worst of it all telling them I was overreacting and that I'm sorry for saying anything and that they're right for calling me out for calling them out... I can't be gaslit but I sure as hell can act like it to avoid conflict don't I? ha ha ha... the things I do for love because I don't want to hurt them even though they hurt me first. It's really not hard to be a decent person especially to a loved one i don't find it difficult why do they? A part of me also thinks the only way I could ever get better and I don't mean outright cured of AvPD but rather just live easier with myself and with other people in this life in a much less difficult way is to have that person by my side who also has AvPD that can truly understand and love me and who'd uplift me and basically all that good things we should expect from being in a relationship whether platonic or romantic. But here i am having doubts that I may not even deserve that and that I should settle because I fear i will never meet that great person I so badly need to love and be loved by.I recently have been reading this book called all about love new visions by bell hooks. It's really given me insight and confirmation about what love really is and one thing I will mention here that is talked about in the book is that abuse and love cannot coexist. It's a hard pill to swallow but it is something that we should talk about more. I suggest all of you to read it it's an amazing book just as the author is. Tldr I've taken up my time to either thinking and maladaptive daydreaming of connecting and having a relationship with someone who i am very much alike with such as sharing same traumas that led both of us to have AvPD. I want and need someone who truly is a great person that not only cares but listens and understands with patience about my thoughts feelings well being and general existence that would make me feel the love I truly deserve because people close to me in my life have not given that love. But yet I fear I will never that and even doubt myself that I might not even deserve that love.To anyone that has read this far thank you for listening and I hope you have a good daynight ,Personality-disorder

50910,Rock. Bottom. I'm at rock bottom right now. I'm about to lose my job my next work day most likely and be jobless. Family is so disappointed in me. Everyday I'm in survival mode at work. Avoidance had bleeded into my job and I can't help it. The anxiety is too crippling and it makes me do all sorts of weird awkward shit at my job. My chronic isolation outside of work also seemingly killed my social skills so I feel numb to all interactions. I sense a mental breakdown is about to erupt and I'm likely to walk away the job but I'd rather get high and lose my job over marijuana then quitting. Either way I'm doomed. I have a bad reputation in my job at this point my real self is being exposed coworkers for sure shame gossiping me. My coworkers all have strong connections with each other now and I'm still that one insecure awkward shy guy. So ashamed. Worked my warehouse job over a year and half now. Idk how I made it this far but my behaviorial symptoms have caught up to me. Literally avoiding everything at work and everybody. Hide in bathroom during breaktimes. Avpd and depression worst combo. Consequently I didn't save enough money while working this warehouse job not only for myself but for the sake of my immediate family as well so everything about to come crashing on me. Addictions make saving money hard even at the sake of supporting family . I let myself down and my family. Sighhh. What a crippling hell of a condition avpd depression is. No excuses. I can't even leave my house. I can see myself being homeless potentially in the near future. Everything that involves making a decision I literally just can't do and that includes getting help. Ik this was a lot y'all just wanted to vent . Your not alone if reading this keep your head high I don't mean to bring u guys down .

51070,My boyfriend broke up with me I'm diagnosed with AvPD and BPD and my boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. I'm 18 and up until about 6 months ago I was convinced I was completely unlovable. I didn't come from such a great home and I was bullied for all of elementary school. All I've been told for all my life is that I am worthless ugly disgusting and just a horrible person. But then I met a guy that made me feel loved like I deserved to be loved for the first time in my life. We dated for 6 months then he broke up with me because I have a personality disorder. I never told him I'm diagnosed with AvPD and BPD because even though he told me he would always love me I was afraid that if he knew about my disorders he'd break up with me. Turns out I was right. Because I finally decided to tell him about a week ago 2 days later he texted me and basically said that he wants to end this. He said he didn't want to be together with someone with borderline. I asked if I did something wrong but he said he just didn't want the drama. I know I didn't do anything wrong I never did anything to hurt him. But just because I've been through shit he doesn't want to love me. The rational part of me knows he's being an asshole but the BPDAvPD part of me wants me to think that I'm the asshole. Was he right not to love me? Am I really that horrible? I don't know what to do. I feel completely worthless no one will ever love me and I shouldn't ever leave my house again. I deserve this.

I had some nice little projects going on met some great people but then everything just went sideways in my life all at once and now I'm slipping back into being almost entirely invisible again and I don't want to be but it feels like all I have to offer now because of it is negativity right now. In a nutshell a lot of family stuff went down and I even am now having a technical problem with my music project I can't find out the issue of and I'm just spending more and more money trying to fix it. The one thing. I found that I enjoy doing and was finally making progress with completely over the course of a single night went under for me. I swear it's like I'm cursed. Everything I love turns to crap and any good times I have in life are always immediately at some point halted by complete tragic BS.

51352,I only have one set of clothes. I can't imagine going to a clothing store. Buy only on the Internet. If I buy online the size does not fit. I don't need a lot of clothes because I don't have to go out. I don't even go to the barbershop. I cut my own hair There is a supermarket right next to the house but I don't go there. Necessary items are purchased through Internet delivery. I used to go to the supermarket often when I was young but I'm 28 years old and still unemployed so I'm afraid the supermarket owner will recognize me.,Personality-disorder
51065,Feeling like a creep in publicon public transport So I've had this for a long time but only now have I sort of grasped why I feel like this.Whenever I'm outside and especially in closed off public transport like the subway I'll feel like a creep because I just stare and analyze everyone and everything. The reality is that when I get anxious I get hyperaware of everything and everyone around me and when I start starting at strangers analyzing every bit of their appearanceclothingpostureetc I start feeling like a creep. Only recently have I realized that the being hyperaware is where the feeling of being a creep comes from vs just organically. With me being less anxious lately I'm more able to just stare off into the distance and distract myself with my thoughts and then suddenly I don't feel so inadequateweird anymore.I know I've thought about this before and even said it to someone that when my anxiety takes over I literally can't think of anything but the present situation. I'll literally start brainstorming ideas to think about so I can distract myself from what's in my face that second.Just felt like typing this out and sharing maybe someone can relate.Much love,Personality-disorder

51119,Can't even show up for my own life and do the activities I wanna do. Honestly don't know where to go from here. Existence is completely wasted on me. I have grouporiented activities I want to join yet I just can't do it...I can't even risk social rejection or ridicule. I'm currently in Thailand on a sixweek trip with my partner and child. While that sentence doesn't exactly sound like it puts me in the category of avoidant personality disorder I am one of the most avoidant people on Earth. I spent three years at university and only ever talked to about four people none of whom I developed friendships with. I've spent my entire adult life working remotely alone at home so that I can avoid any work environment that requires socializing. Even my relationship is pretty lowquality we don't exactly sit down and have lengthy interesting conversations every day.But perhaps even worse still there are various grouporiented activities I'd love to try that would bring value to my life and I can't at all bring myself to do them. One example is muay Thai. I signed up for a class yesterday arrived at the gym and turned back at the entrance. This has happened several times. And it's a consistent theme in my adult life whether the activity is a martial art soccer or a hiking meetup. Basically I can't show up for my own life and do the activities that I value. I'm not really living and never really have. I'm now 32 years old FFS close to middleaged. I'm almost certain I'll be dead before 35...what a waste of a human I am.,Personality-disorder
51099,How do you feel about becoming a parent while having AvPD? I'm going through a horrible situation with my reproductive health. Until the point of having to get treatment for conceiving and all as my tests are showing I don't have much time left for postponing getting pregnant. The thing is that at 25 my recently diagnosed avpd has destroyed me. Even though I have a career I'm financially stable and got to organize my life a bit. I don't have quality of life. I'm so anxious I can't even function worried about what the neighbors around my apartment might think of me. I still leave the house for going to work but sometimes I'm so freaking exhausted I cannot take care of myself. And I can't stop but wonder if becoming a parent would be a good idea for me or if it will be better to forget about it as I seem to be a person who doesn't fit into the scheme of a good parent. I used to dreamed about having babies back when i was younger but now i think that would be the most egotistical decision i could ever takespecially for a child that didn't ask to be born or have a trashy parent like me who cannot even go to the supermarket alone.,Personality-disorder

50585,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling...

51394,Does anyone else here want a loving caring close relationship but at the same time just cant get comfortable with the idea of being with someone else? Im 28 and soon to be 29. Due to childhood trauma abuse and neglect I grew very up lonely and to this day have never been in a relationship. I tried online dating and met a few people. Unfortunately no one panned out. While Ill admit I wasnt interested in any of them I also just find myself feeling uncomfortable being with someone who knows your close personal life. Ive never really had a close relationship with anyone my whole life. Ive always been a loner and its been my comfort zone. I fantasize and would just love to have a partner who I can spend time with. But I have so little confidence and so worried about being judged that I just cant put in the effort to start a serious relationship. Im a weird loser with no friends and no hobbies even if I have a good career and ok life otherwise. Being close with someone else makes me feel so uncomfortable. I also get exhausted by look at what it takes to maintain a relationship. Im hoping I can get over this one day. Anyone else feel the same way?,Personality-disorder

51215,Anyone else here forever alone? Usually Im fine Ive known Ill be alone for years but sometimes the reality of it all comes crashing in. I have so much love to give but il never get to experience it being wanted by another person being loved or being able to love. The thing that 99 of the population will experience i am denied access to because I happened to receive some shit luck from the universe. How am I meant to accept that? Ive watched my friends who were just like me grow into capable adults experiencing relationships and new friendships while I havent moved at all. Im still the same stupid fucking kid I was at 16 terrified of the world and all the people in it. I am certain my brain wasnt built for life not in this world.This disorder is fucking brutal its completely ruined my life all I wanted was to be normal. But now Im doomed to this loneliness for life. And I cant ignore it every piece of media every time I leave the house theres love and couples everywhere. And Im not mad at them good for them Im just struggling to accept the fact that everybody else gets to experience it and i happen to be one of the unlucky few that doesnt all thanks to avpd. It hurts too fucking much the loneliness eats away at you all I asked was to feel wanted or validated by even 1 human being but apparently even that is too much. Its not even about the sex at all I just want to feel someone elses warmth have somebody fall asleep on my chest feeling safe and secure in my presence trusting me enough to open up to eachother. Avpd is so horrible this loneliness will 100 drive me to suicide Im not far off as it is. No human was meant to live like this I wouldnt even call it living. Sure you can survive with avpd but I dont think anyone can really say theyre really living if I knew I was gonna have to live with this shit Id have killed myself in the fucking womb I wish my mum did she deserves better. Sry for the stupid drunk rant just had to vent it somewhere. I hate myself so fucking much I never should have existed avpd is just too cruel how can this be my life how am I mean to be ok with that how am I meant to participate in society like every one else? I wish I was dead I should be dead theres just no point struggling with the rest of my life if its going to be alone.

Then at the hairdresser being reminded Im not normal as I try and fake being so for the consultation. Next week I have to sit an hour and 45 minutes while they dye my hair.

50885,Feeling I don't belong When I'm alone or doing my own thing I don't feel alone so much. I'm used to being alone and doing my own thing and here and there I communicate with people. That's okay. But when I'm suppised to be part of a group I start to feel inferior to others and that I don't belong. Everyone else is interacting with each other but somehow I am left outside the group. The school and Uni were propably the worst because you are alone amongst everybody else everyday. In my current work everything is okay because I work from home and I don't see the others interacting all the time. I just pretend that everyone else is doing their work alone same as me. But. Now we have this group work at my work and now I feel alone again. We should be interacting with each other but I'm not interacting with anyone.

Less drama no risk of annoying people. But then I also wonder if maybe in reality Im just loud sometimes to make up for the way too many times Ive kept everything inside?

Today I was diagnosed as autistic after a 1.5 year process of multiple assessments culminating in a 3 hour assessment today with 2 clinic psychiatrists and an autism nurse.

50651,Feeling like I don't do enough I'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not if it's imposter syndrome if it's from old Christian mantras of put others before yourself being baked into my psyche since childhood or if it's a combination of all three but I often feel like I don't do enough for other people in my life. Whether it's with other family members close friends or coworkers I often get this sense. I work from home. And I've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. But now that we're sitting near the finish line almost ready to golive with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover I can't help but feel some kind of guilt like I'm not doing enough. Even though I helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. With friends or family it often comes in the form of should I be there? or I know I be there be present but I really don't want to and then I just feel like a POS terrible friendsiblingsonetc. for not doing it. For example a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. Naturally I didn't go. I'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. Nonetheless I still felt like an asshole for skipping. Especially later when I talked to my dad and asked how it went I asked who was there? and he said Just about everyone. Except for you. I don't think he intended to make me feel guilty but it kind of did. My mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it but nonetheless I felt like I didn't do enough. Even though again this relative having the child and I don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. Another example is a friend a close friend who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. They'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants and 9 times out of 10 I don't go. Part of me appreciates the hell out of that because I need it and it's nice to be includedwanted. Another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone because I don't think I'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. Then I start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. Wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder or if it's something else. Anyone else experience this?,Personality-disorder
51183,Feeling jealousy and not good enough when close friends start talking to someone else and direct most of their attention to them To be clear I'm not talking about drifting away from each other over time but rather like getting ditched where it all happens in a few minutes or less. This has happened to me a few times but the worst time was a few days ago because it happened with the closest friend I've ever had. It actually happened with them a few months ago too. I also feel bad for feeling like this and trying hard to not push them away but just can't control these feelings. A few days ago we were playing an online game together as we often do and after a while they mentioned that they were also talking to another friend while playing and I realized that was why they were so quiet compared to all the other times. I started shutting down after that but kept playing together for a few hours. We didn't say anything but I knew they were talking to the other friend instead. They did say bye when they were getting off and for the first time I didn't say anything back. Still haven't said anything and feel bad cause we are the best friends each other has ever had and I know for sure it is true for them they are not lying. But just can't help these feelings of not wanting to talk to them anymore and pushing them away. I feel so ridiculous for feeling like this like for them it's just a normal interaction with someone else and not knowing how bad it made me feel.,Personality-disorder

51557,Longtime lurker with AvPD just wanting to vent about the fantasy of disappearing and starting a different life Using my alt throwaway because reasons. Recently Ive been having a hard time and although I have deeply caring and wonderful people in my life I still isolate and as much as I crave time with others I get tired so easily after a short while. Also grew up with cluster B parents and family which doomed me to some kind of mental problems. Lately Ive begun to think about the idea of just leaving. Disappearing no trace. Not suicide. Im not suicidal at all I mean leaving going somewhere Im not known changing all my details and completely starting over. I cant help but feel it would make no difference to anyone in fact it might even be better.Ive googled step by step how tos on it.Im hoping to be able to talk to others who have been in this dark of a place and what got you through or any advice.Because this is mostly just a fantasy but the idea is sticking in my head more than Id like it to. I dont actually want to go through with it. I think Edit for clarity what got you through the mental state if youve felt this way not advice on disappearing. Oops!,Personality-disorder
51571,Why do I want to be famous?Someone dm me pls Why do I want to be famous?Someone dm me plsThis is a throwaway account. People on social media always say Im trying to get attention but wtf is wrong with that? I dont know for sure if I have avpd but I think I do I cant pay for therapy I live with my mom and I hate her Im 18 cant drive alone I always get in crashes or get a ticket sometimes I speed because Im mad at my uncle. I have a job but I dropped out of school because I dont care and I have so much trauma from everything in my childhood. And anyway nothing matters now except being famous thats all I want I just have no idea why in real life I avoid people but online I have a girlfriend and Im obsessed with her it scares me sometimes because I cant stop thinking about her and if she broke up with me I dont think I could take it Ive only met her once in real life but it doesnt matter I talk to her all the time but the most important thing is that she talks to me and shes obsessed with me so I need her. I think I deserve to be famous more than anyone else because Ive been through so much and also I feel like Im better than most people something about me is different and Im special . Can someone dm me to talk more about this? I need to know why I want to be famous and how can I get famous? Also is it possible to have avpd and want to be famous?,Personality-disorder
51510,Anyone else have trouble verbalizing their thoughts and feelings? I used to be quite eloquent when I was younger despite not talking to anyone. I always had the right word or description for what I intended to say. If only I wasnt an asshole and actually practiced conversation.. Not sure where it all started to escape me. Could be when my mental health went downhill or when I got off my meds or when I got high almost every day for a year. But nowadays its not uncommon for me to struggle to write simple sentences. Sending an email or text takes me way longer than it should.It really interferes when Im trying to talk with others.

50802,My brain just goes blank even if I want to engage I don't know if this is an AvPD thing or not but does anybody else here mostly don't speak as much during conversations because your brain just goes completely blank? I frequently find myself at conversations most of them tbh where I want to talk and engage but I just don't know what to respond at all. I catch myself saying a lot of mmm yeah it's true I agree but not something... substancial you know? Sometimes I even repeat words just to use more time like yeah yeah.Meanwhile when I observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going and it seems so natural for them. I always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than I can and honestly I think this has been proven true over time.Some time ago I created a personal system to help me fill up silences and some of the things I set myself to do at these moments where 1. just think out loud without filtering so much I read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes think with their mouths while introverts think first then decide if it's worth sharing and for us with AvPD andor SAD we mostly decide it is not and 2. look for a subject connection even if it's minimal then be like this reminds me of... and keep going about it.When I observe other people interacting I can see them using these a lot naturally I feel like a robot because I had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice but even with this system I'm still having problems because like I said a lot of times I simply can't think of anything. I don't know if this is some kind of freeze response to the danger of socialization or if my brain is just socially dumb lol.,Personality-disorder

I tell them to be quiet but soon they are making a lot of noise again. Sometimes i went up to them and scold them sometimes even calling them names such was the anger. My mother says that I am not very understanding and very hard on them. I feel like I got a little bit of the avoidant trait from her personality.I'm not diagnosed with AvPD but i'm pretty sure that i have it.

51360,Levelsdegress of AvPD Recently i was watching a live of Personality Disorders and this psychiatry said that there is a reason of why AvPD isn't diagnosed enough or clinically useless i didn't like this term sometimes the AvPD is mild so it's confused with a normal anxiety or when more serious it's diagnosed as Social Anxiety. The aforementioned speech makes me real pessimistic about this disorder as iit makes clear that we are really neglected. Clinically useless what the hell? I think that there's a reason for so much misinformation about AvPD the people who know the most about this disorder are those who suffer daily on skin but we can't provide clinical care because we are weakened so there's a big cycle of misinformation and no progress. In short average people cannot understand us satisfactorily. Advances on this disorder will certainly come but I believe it will not be so soon. I hope you guys may have understood my point. Discussions are open. ,Personality-disorder

I did get married twice but left quickly as soon as things became difficult and while I was in them I was very much a loner. I had no desire to go out with friends do things with family and such.I start projects with earnest and get so excited about them yet cant follow through to finish them.Even on Reddit I have no problem starting a conversation yet when someone replies it puts me in flight mode Im so afraid Ill be seen as dumb or unlearned. Or that my opinion isnt worthy of a response.I have the get up and go that got up and went I guess you could say.

51163,social anxiety vs avpd what do you guys think of the whole debate around whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder? of course we aren't professionals but i think we can still have our own input. i was diagnosed with social anxiety when i was 15 a month after i dropped out of school and became houseboundagoraphobic and because of that i wasnt able to understand the things i was truly struggling nor were the professionals able to understand. when i ended up inpatient for the first time at age 17 i couldnt leave my room until i was forced to wasnt able to talk to other patients or make friends every time i was in hospital or in some sort of program. i had online friends but then i started becoming convinced that they hated me so i ended up ghosting every online friend i had. when i was 18 i discovered what avpd was and i was amazed by how much i related to every single thing about it even more so than i related to the diagnostic criteria of bpd which i was diagnosed with. i brought up the idea of avpd to a psychiatrist last fall and she pretty just said i agree but also mentioned that theres debate on whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder so idek if she changed my diagnosis or not which kinda annoys me but whatever. i just think from what i know about social anxiety is that well its obviously anxiety related so it deals more with anxious thoughts surrounding social activities. avpd to me is more so the innate feelings that you are inept and that there is something deeply wrong with you to the core and thats why nobody likes you therefore you stay alone. i just think they're separate things because not everyone with social anxiety experiences that. let me know what you guys think!,Personality-disorder

51338,Do you feel that you fit in here? Or on Reddit in general? I've been mostly lurking around here for many months now and I'm constantly seeing posts that make me feel like I don't belong or I'm an odd one out. Like other people think and communicate in a certain way that's different from my own or have an understanding of what AvPD means that clashes with my own or they have fairly ordinary life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me.I don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself if AvPD is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path I've taken through life.Also Reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind' where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. I see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that?If you don't feel you fit in why is that specifically? What details about you clash with what you perceive as the Reddit or rAvPD cultures?And if you DO feel you fit in especially on Reddit in general how does that relate to your AvPD? Is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective something like that?

51539,I love the idea of a romantic relationship but I cant put the work in. I 28M feel like any kind of datingrelationships is just work work work work work work. I like the idea of having a connection in my life but I dont think Im willing to do what it takes.I think bc Im so lowmaintenance I attract a lot of very clingy needy people which made me hate the idea of dating because theyd never leave me alone. And not just the process of dating itself which sucks for most people but just being in a relationship requires too much work and expectations. Maybe Im just lazy but how do you have the motivation to keep going with dating when its just annoyance?,Personality-disorder
51446,My friend expressed that she is disappointed in me. Long story short I felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class. I didn't show up for this class in forever and didn't turn in much work so she was worried I'd procrastinate like I did in 1 semester and fail.When I said I'll probably skip again she looked at me with so much disappointment and said I really should stop caring about people that much.It didn't register then but it hits me now how hurt I am from her words. It feels like I'm not doing good enough and I probably am not. So that day I forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. But I can't get the look on her face out of my mind.To be fair to her I said I needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. So maybe she didn't think I felt as horrible as I did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.,Personality-disorder
51019,Does anyone else feel like they're too boring to have friends? If you ask me what my hobbies are I can't name any. If you ask me what my talents are I can't name any.I follow current events politics foreign policy. I read the Washington Post and the NY Times and The Economist. I listen to podcasts. But to me that's not so much a hobby as just part of being a responsible citizen who keeps up with what's going on in the world. I try to go running or ride my stationary bike a few times a week. But again I don't see that as a hobby but just doing what we're all technically supposed to do to minimize the risk of health problems. None of these are things that really bring you closer to people or are conducive to meeting them.When I was in college there'd always be some guy who was an amazing guitar player and people would just magnetically gravitate toward him and just vibe. I've never had any musical talent. Or people would just play frisbee or pickup soccer. I've never been able to do something like that. My body freezes up I panic I'm afraid I'm going to make a mistake and everyone else will get mad at me. In middle school PE if we had to play soccer or basketball I'd always just stand as far off to the side as I could and run away from the ball if it was anywhere near me if I was getting in trouble for that I'd say I had to go to the bathroom or wasn't feeling well and needed to see the nurse. In HS I ran cross country precisely because so much of the competition wasn't being watched you didn't have to do anything with other people and if you messed up it was solely on you and nobody else would get pissed off at you. A lot of people seem to do things like play softball or volleyball in rec leagues and I wish I could do something like that without having a panic attack and feeling like a fucking spaz. I've never really played video games. When I was growing up my parents basically forbade me from playing any that they regarded as too violent which meant nothing like Halo or CoD or the other popular franchises people would get into. And I've always avoided them as an adult because if I started spending a bunch of time playing video games by myself somehow that would make me feel even more isolated than I already am.I've never really done any traveling because I've always felt too selfconscious to take a trip by myself. I'm a guy so I don't have the excuse of safety which can be an issue for women doing solo travel in some parts of the world. In college I never did any kind of study abroad because I was afraid I'd get there and nobody would like me and I'd basically be trapped there for weeks with no way to escape. I'd feel embarrassed about not being able to speak to people in their native language even though virtually no Americans can do that anyway. I see people on social media backpacking through Europe or Asia and hanging out with all these people they just met and I have no fucking clue how they pull that off. Does anyone else feel this way? Almost like you're just a NonPlayer Character in a video game who doesn't really get to have their own story while everyone else is going on adventures through life? If I meet someone and they ask what I like to do I basically draw a blank. Or if not do you have any suggestions for how to make yourself more interesting?,Personality-disorder

Having a caretaker that herself demonstrated anxiety at least when I was 5 years old or older was a major problem for me.Her crying and certain angry responses to distress really messed me up I think.Her low level of confidence relative to my dad though even my dad is low in emotional intelligence.It is only now that I realize that it had a negative impact on me.,Personality-disorder

51051,Sometimes I feel like I don't actually exist like I'm a ghost of sorts. Does anyone else know this feeling? I don't speak to anyone most days. Just my mom and dad sometimes my sister. When I do speak my voice sounds all weird because of the lack of practice. It's kinda funny because I've noticed that despite being fluent in English it's my second language but I've studied it since I was a kid sometimes I forget how to speak it properly. Sometimes I say things that don't make grammatical sense or I don't pronounce words correctly. Idk why this is happening. Maybe because I rarely speak with other people that aren't my parents. No one ever notices me. In school it doesn't matter if I sit on the back or all the way on the front no one ever talks to me and I don't talk to anyone. I haven't had a meaningful relationship of any kind with anyone in literal years. The last friend I ever had was when I was 12. I'm 23 now. I spent all high school sitting by myself behind a tree. Even now in college I'm by myself. I rarely leave my house. It's so fucking pathetic but I just can't make friends. I don't relate to anyone. I don't feel comfortable around anyone. I feel like I'm acting whenever I interact with someone like it's not real. I don't feel like a real person.,Personality-disorder
50612,I can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life I'm in my 40s now. The last time I had friends was in school. I'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. Actually I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. My friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends i.e. other outsiders. We'd meet to play computer games or sometimes rarely go swimming. But we never really talked about personal stuff. I'm not even sure this counts as friendship?Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together? Am I even capable of friendship?Consequently friendship isn't something I've been looking for. Maybe if I knew what I'm missing out on I would?I'm about to embark on a psychotherapy journey again and I feel unprepared. What do I even want?,Personality-disorder
50788,Am I missing out on life?? I have am currently in my final year of med school and am 23 right now. I havent been in any relationships yet and am still a virgin even though all my friends are in relationships or having flings and I feel really horrible about it. 2 years ago I was sad that I didnt even have a social life in college but luckily I found a good small group of friends but my love life in college has just been a series of unrequited loves which has left me anxious and hurt for most of my college life. I feel major fomo and maybe that Im unlovable as a person and I sometimes make peace with that but hearing my friends have romantic or sexual experiences really makes me feel shitty again.

I am feeling a ton of social anxiety and to compound that avpd is on overdrive. desperately want to hide and isolate and just get away from everyone including the few people I actually know here. Just hopefully stubbly ditched my one acquaintance here to go find a spot alone. I feel completely uncomfortable physically and mentally. I have to stay here because I have a networking event my boss is going to and Im a guest of honor so Im required to stay until tonight for but that makes everything even worse because people are bound to come up to me and ask about my work.

51344,Trying to explain the main difference between Social Anxiety and AvPD One of the most common questions on this subreddit is the difference between SAD and AvPD. Lately I've been trying to put it like this Social anxiety I'm afraid they'll see how nervous I am fear of embarrassment AvPD I'm afraid they'll see how inept I am fundamental belief of inferiorityOn top of that AvPD is more severe prevalent in every aspect of life and persistant there's no periods where you DON'T feel it whereas SAD is situational you might not feel anxiety in every social situation and go through periods where you feel lessno anxiety. But the belief of being inferior has to be the main thing that sets AvPD apart from SAD. Because of this deeprooted belief every social interaction everything someone says can be taken as rejection and therefore as a confirmation of our beliefs about ourselves. Even positive situations can confirm these beliefs 'they like me now but once they really know me they'll hate me' or 'they're only pretending to like me'. Another thing is the belief of inferiority often shows up outside of social situations e.g. avoiding doing homeworkwriting essays or even hobbies because you feel like it wouldn't be good enough.Does this make sense?

51508,Nobody in my life has ever truly known me. I put up so many masks around everybody. I show some parts of myself to some people and other parts to other people. And some parts I never show anybody and probably never will. Nobody in my life has ever truly known me they only know the person Ive shown them. Its exhausting but its basically second nature at this point and I literally dont know how to be anything else. I find myself telling so many little lies even about the most mundane things about myself and I dont even mean to do it on purpose. My opinions are always what I think the other person wants to hear. Every word I say and everything I show on the surface is always a watered down version of what I truly want to say and feel. Even when Im just in the car with someone I only play music I think they would like or what I want them to think I listen to. Most of the time I dont even know what parts of myself are true or not. Im like a puzzle made up of completely different pieces that dont fit together. Its all just so fucked. I dont know how to fix this.

I now realise that it's too late. I grew in such an abusive family that I never learned how to love and relate. And then I fell ill. Since then I became disabled. Sometimes my arms hurt so bad that I can't type. I've been trying to survive a gruesome situation for months now. I can only communicate in short bursts. All the rest that I need is gone. And I put myself out there. Ashamed and small. Guess what? No one cares. I'm at fault too. But it's not only me. I hope it will be over soon. But I rather struggle alone. I hope that I can get some of my hobbies back take up space. I can't chat anymore it makes me want to barf. I can't really go outside and to be honest I am scared. I found out how easy it is to abuse me. It's not like I can run just hide. There's nothing much to say. I truly am alone. I am different but I just want to be in peace with myself with the chronic pain with the fact that people and I don't work together. I'm not charming or young. I'm just venting into the nothingness. I isolated more and more when I got negative feedback. It's too late now. Everybody struggles I don't understand basic things. I just want the current crisis to be over. Don't want to improve myself. Or to function. I want to breathe and sleep without fear until shit really hits the fan and we'll all break together and apart. Sometimes it feels like too much to ask. I want to believe that I matter not because of someone else. It's not going to happen.,Personality-disorder

50991,Hey here are some thoughts of mine I believe some or all of you could relate to for your next therapy visit.. AVPD In summary So I feel..Sexually compulsive I feel energy drained.. stress accumulated leading to failureStress about just anything in general.. too much of itDifficult to have own opinion I doubt if I even agree on the way that I feel or think about a certain topic at times. I believe this stems from stressDepressed.. sometimes I just feel like all the light and life has been sucked out of me at random times. Occurs usually when Im around people and gives me a feeling of desolation like I am emotionally alone in my own worldI want to finish this with a little bit of food for thought of what I have come to a conclusion is what doubt has done in your life and mineGuys think of any moment youve felt doubt.. remove moments of doubt which you can be sure of where the doubt came from like at school while taking a test. Now every other moment where the reason for the stress feels out there in the galaxy thats where I strongly feel stress inhibits us and we dont even bat an eye and question it. But why question why you are stressed.. isnt this just part of who I am? I should learn to live with it.. its so difficult to live this way we are so intermingled with stress that it just becomes a part of us and sadly we stop seeing it this way for whatever reason we have but doubt lives upstairs from us casting a cloud over us every time it kicks and stomps over our thoughts and our ambitions into what feels like uncaring mundanity..,Personality-disorder

Im the only single person here and theres so many years of bonding and inside jokes Ive missed out on. You know when at the beginning of the night everyone seems happy to see you and laughs at your comments if youre your lucky but then everyone slowly stops replying to you and distancing themselves from you as the night goes on. I also got overstimulated and frustrated very briefly not at anyone in particular but now I just feel like I overstayer my welcome.

Im in my early 20s and struggle to see things getting better even though I probably have the power somewhere in me to change for the better. I guess Im just getting impatient and frustrated with myself because of the way I am. Ive been feeling low again lately and the biggest reason is probably loneliness. I wish simply talking to others wasnt a struggle and I wish I didnt view my appearance as objectively terrible amp repulsive. I wish I had things to talk about and I wish I was someone people looked forward to seeing. And I wish I knew what people thought about me even if very few people have interacted with me. I wish I could make a positive impact on someones life. The thing is as much as Id like to make a friend would the friendship even last considering Im over halfway into my university degree?

50704,At this point I dont think theres anything in this world that can cure this innate sense of loneliness inside me. Am I destined to be like this forever? Relationships seem pointless and I dont know if I could even handle being in one anyway. Ive basically been alone my whole life and I dont know how to be anything else. Ive never even had a crush on an actual person. It sounds conceited but nobody Ive met is interesting to me in that way and I feel like if I gave someone a chance Id just end up breaking their heart because of this nothingness inside me. Right now I cant even imagine myself being intimate with anyone and I feel like Im not emotionally available enough to have someone rely on me like that. Theyd probably end up feeling more like a burden to me more than anything and I dont want to do that to anyone.I really hope one day Im wrong and Ill meet someone that makes me feel a little more human but I dont have much hope.,Personality-disorder
51272,How do you even expose yourself to the public or gain experience when you are 30? I have been hiding from people for so long. Even when I was going to school I was finding ways to hide from the world. I got sad again and randomly searched avoidance on YouTube and one video that popped up was from this guy called Dr. K. I guess he's a popular mental health streamer on Twitch and a psychiatrist who works at Harvard.I don't really play video games anymore but I do think I have an internet addiction. Back in the day I definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people so I do relate to those who have gaming addiction avoidance. A lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me. He talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart. Now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audience's ass but on the other hand I can see a lot of introverted smart but shy types gravitating towards games. A lot of the people I knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people even the lazy ones who never amounted to anything in life.Now the part that I wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life. He mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life so they don't really struggle early in life but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed. Their selfconscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged. Anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance. What a lot of these people don't understand is that they need to gain experience not intelligence in order to succeed. I looked up Dr. K's history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in India. He came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist. So I guess he's proof that fighting avoidance works.But what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already 30 able to do? He had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was 20 and able to come back and succeed. Not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there. Again this could be due to experience and desensitizing himself but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary. For someone like me my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that.I find that a lot of success stories ignore that the people who were struggling were not as extreme as a lot of people like myself.,Personality-disorder

50796,The Root cause of my AVPD I have spent a lot of time thinking about how I ended up with this disorder. Constantly reviewing and analyzing my past memories trying to find and pinpoint the exact event that caused me to be this way. I wasn't sure I had one and I still think it may be multiple events in my life that led to the development of this disorder. But for me I think the formation of my AVPD has always been interlinked with my sexuality. I am gay and Hispanic. Growing up in a Mexican household parents are not accepting of that whatsoever. Anyways I remember I still remember this time where I was looking up basically dick pics and I didn't delete the search history. I was 13 at the time and was barely discovering porn. My mom checked it before any of us got home and while she was at work later she called my dad and told him about what she found. My dad told me that she was crying because she couldn't accept that her son might be gay. I explained it away to my dad that I was just checking to see how I sized up to other boys my age. But I sorta knew what I was doing. I guess that moment was pretty scary to me. Knowing not even my own parents would accept me. And so I hid myself for a long time. Pretending to be straight year after year. It just got harder every year to put on the mask. And still now at the age of 24 I have never told anyone in my personal life that I'm gay. Not like they don't know it or highly suspect it even though I present myself more masculine. I've never had a girlfriend so I think it's pretty obvious to everyone. But anyways I think it was very much so having to do with moments like I first mentioned. Where I was scared and felt completely alone. I guess it would have changed everything to have someone to tell me it's ok and that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm loved just the same. But I didn't get that. I just learned from an early age that I was different and so I would be treated differently unless I hid it.,Personality-disorder
51189,Therapy or Attachment Therapy? 50something gay man here. While Ive been in therapy for most of my life because I was always dealing with dysthymia Persistent Depression Attachment issues were never discovered or diagnosed. A year ago TMS put my depression into remission which has been amazing. Awesome. Endless superlatives. However....With PDD no longer fouling the view surprisesurprise I see now that DismissiveAvoidant Attachment has been playing merrily in my psyche my attention having been elsewhere.I've never had a real deep intimate sexual relationship. Sex yes. Friends yes but again none particularly deep. Distancing. Closed off. Difficulty trusting. From what I can tell DA has influenced inhibited even impaired a lot of areas of my life. Id like to fix or improve those if I can. To be honest Im a bit concerned read scared that I wont be able to do that. DA is a hard one to move to Secure Attachment. From reading it looks like it basically takes an intimate SA partner and therapy to change an attachment style. Since I haven't even had a crappy intimate relationship that seemsunlikely. lolI have therapist right now. Weve talked a bit about this. Hes not an expert certified in Attachment Therapy. Cognitive Behavioral? Yes. General support especially with the TMS stuff yes. Given the seeming intractability of DA I'm wondering if he's right for tackling this? I know DA is an error in cognition but its also wrapped up in feelings and in behaviors that Im not even aware of. Trauma. Family of origin stuff. There's a lot that goes into DA. And while I've tackled much of this in regular therapy I've never come at it from an attachment angle with someone who specialized in Attachment Theory and stylesSo in your opinion is it better to have a therapist that specializes in Attachment Issues or is that not necessary? Will an Attachment group or class suffice? Is changing therapists reasonable here I'm up for doing that or is that idea someone just another sign of Avoidant Dismissing behavior? While I aint dead and have no plans on dying anytime soon or later for that matter I would like to fix this DA before I shuffle off. Along those lines Id like to stumble and fail at a real relationship or two I know DA is hard to lessen on the off chance that I just succeed at one. I want to improve my life. Im just trying to figure out the best way to go at it. Any advice here would be great.,Personality-disorder

She suggested we meet up and considering how much I've progressed recently I figured I wouldn't give myself enough time to reconsiderdoubt myself and just said yes.I was pretty chill for the most part but my nerves got the best of me once there were only two hours left before the date but it still wasn't nearly as bad as it would've been before.The date went pretty well. I was pretty nervous but nothing that was overwhelming. We walked and talked a bunch went to a small art exhibition grabbed some ice cream and then I had to leave.Overall a very pleasant experience despite the nervousness. I would have neeever in my life had thought that I'd be able to go on a tinder date fully sober. In the past I had to get blackout drunk other drugs to even text people on Tinder so I'm very very very glad I had the power in me to not cancel or chicken out and actually go through with this even if nothing might come of it. I'll definitely have more confidence moving forward thanks to this experience.Good luck out there!,Personality-disorder
51081,things change I've been in an episode of complete isolation for about 3yrs but doing my best to claw myself out. With a therapist's encouragement I reached out to the person I love more than anything who I've been in love with for years and she full of grace and compassion accepted me back. But she is in a relationship now. I told myself that this was likely and that I would be okay with it but I don't think I am. I feel sick to my stomach and haven't stopped crying. How can I be a good friend when it's so painful to talk to her when all the advice says that to get over unrequited love you should distance yourself when that's exactly what I'm trying NOT to do? I can't hurt her again by distancing myself without explaining why but I can't tell her how I feel because that would be disrespectful of her relationship. I've completely ruined everything I deserve the pain I'm feeling but I still can't cope with it. It sounds like it's new. If I'd been able to reach out even a few months earlier I might have been able to tell her. Now I feel like I've lost my one and only chance to be happy. I'm so selfish and stupid. I don't know what to do. I hate myself so much.,Personality-disorder

50851,Just a warning. But don't stop taking your meds. Hello just want to share my experience. Please watch out with using meds long term. Especially benzos. If you need meds you need meds. No doubts. But most meds don't heal. They're a temporary solution. I compare benzos to alcohol.. Very effective for anxiety. Strange comparison? No they both make things worse in the long term. A benzo addiction is one of the worst addictions you can have. My psychiatrist putted me on them for 5 years daily. In didn't knew better 15 years ago. No internet... Very irresponsible from him. The withdrawals are insane. I never experienced something like that. Even more harsh compared to hard drugs wellbenzos are a hard drug. And I did a lot of drugs in the past. I learned from it. 15 years ago I said for every problem there's a pill. Can you imagine that? I was delusional and unaware. There's not a magic pill or drug. Sorry I have to say this. Maybe I'm saying well known things. But use benzos with caution. 4 weeks at max... Or 2 times a week. Otherwise you're in for a very unpleasant surprise that can ruin your life.But yeah... I'm not a doc...and don't stop taking your meds cause you're reading this. Talk about it with a professional. Ask advice. Do research about the meds you're taking. Meds can help a lot. But not long term. Long term a big no go.,Personality-disorder

51023,The rare occasion where I decide to speak up I end up saying something stupid and retreat back into my comfort zone Frustratingly it takes time for me to get back out. I keep thinking how dumb it was for me to even bother trying when I shouldve stayed quiet like usual. Its annoying because when it comes to social situations I pretty much never forget things so I can end up dwelling on things a lot.,Personality-disorder
50623,AvPD and covid has ruined my dream job. So I've been a nanny for about 10 years now daycare before that and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction. I'd go to work one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say goodnight and that was it. Since covid however at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to say hi to their kid. I worry so much about where they are what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby my appearance the way I dress. I imagine they're mocking the way I sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.I am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder. I can't tell you how many times I've tossed my phone across the room when I hear footsteps coming because even if I am only looking up the weather or craft ideas I'm terrified they'll think I'm on the phone all day.,Personality-disorder
51098,What helps you get better? Yesterday i saw a post that a person asked if anyone here had improve on AvPD and asked for tips. Almost nobody answered so i'll try again because i really want to know any way to improve.

51255,Is anyone else full of love but unable to express it? Does anyone else really love and care for those around you but feel physically incapable of expressing it? Not just verbally but by interacting with them at all. I'll go to family events and think how much I love everyone there but am too anxious to join in on talking to people. I feel like people think I don't like them when that couldn't be further from the truth. I'm so uncomfortable and embarrassed by expressing affection itself too. It's like there's this block in my head that prevents me from getting the words out. This is why I know I'd be incapable of a romantic relationship never had one. These things are a crucial part of them but I'm incapable of doing them.,Personality-disorder
51535,Conversational and social skills what are they I think Ive never given myself a chance to develop them because of AvPD. I couldve had a fuller social life in school but I was so in my shell I just had a few close friends. And even with them I felt I couldve been better. It seemed like they all clicked with each other very well and even though we were all good friends sometimes there was something missing in my connection with people. I know they say skills are to be learned but it really really REALLY seems like its just inborn for other people. So I just do everything I can to avoid one on one conversations so nobody has the chance to think Im weird and dont know how to talk or something.,Personality-disorder

50947,gender rules amp being in a relationship as avoidant guy I don't mean to offend anyone beliefs just a thought came to my mind and i want to discuss it with you.recently i redownloaded dating apps and started chatting seeking friends and relationships.I was chatting with this girl and we talked about many things. One of them was relationships she told me that she prefers to be in a relationship with traditional gender rules.this made me think and realized that a relationship with traditional gender rules isn't for me and i think this mainly has something to do with being avoidant. these are my reasonsI don't initiate or take actions. Usually i respond to actions even sometimes i don't respond to actions that other people would respond to i rarely take actions or be proactive.I lack assertiveness I also have problem with decision making.that is what comes to my mind when i think about it.Guys with avoidant do you think that you can be in a relationship with traditional gender rules? also do you have any other reasons beside the ones i listed if why not?,Personality-disorder
50738,I might have AvPD okay let's keep it short I have had 3 depressions since I was 13 20 now mixed with social anxiety throughout my whole life. Currently in therapy trying to find out why I keep getting depressed without a trigger. I thought about autism but I only have symptoms relating to social interaction. So no sensory issues or interests and such.My therapist mentioned personality problems not a disorder So i started looking in to it and I relate alot to AvPD. Could i have AvPD?Anyone else who thought it could be autism but it turned out to AvPD?Info about AvPD is welcome since I'm new to this.,Personality-disorder

51082,everyone stares and judges you leaving the house is so difficult because no matter where i am i can feel like every single person is staring at me and making fun of me or judging me. when i walk outside i can feel the stares from everyone in their cars. when im on a bus i can feel the eyes of every single person on the bus. even when i just get out of my house i feel like the whole neighbourhood is staring at me. i know ive been experiencing this for a long time. definitely since i was a teenager i grew my hair out so that it can cover a lot of my face because i felt like people were doing that. my first memory of having anxiety i was 6 and i was late to school and was too afraid to walk in the class because everyone would look at me. it took me 10 mins just to walk in and then because of that my teacher yelled at me in front of the class. i would feel sick before presentations in elementary school and didnt know why. any kind of attention on me scares the living shit out of me. i dont know if this is avpd or not but it causes me so much distress. it doesnt help that i didnt leave my house for many years and was agoraphobic.,Personality-disorder
50653,Devastated after finding out my little sister has a secret boyfriend Not sure if this belongs here but I'm so upset about this that I haven't slept all night. My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts interests and even my mental health struggles. I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything. Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities. I knew this day would come my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone abandoned and betrayed. She never mentioned that guy to me and my father I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything. Of course I want her to be happy but now all I'm left to do is wait for her to get married move to a different country and forget about me leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone.,Personality-disorder
50960,this disorder is repulsive to me The idea that I feel I need validation from others unconsciously and am so sensitive to other people's perceptions is disgusting. The repulsion comes from the fact that I know I resonate with it deeply but hate that I do.,Personality-disorder
51511,I want to curl up into my bed and never leave This week has been absolute hell. I feel so overwhelmed with life right now and I want to be completely alone. I dont want to be perceived or asked why I missed two weeks of class. I dont want people constantly and very publicly asking me if Im okay. Yes Im fine but no Im not fine. Im fine enough to function but I also want to run away. I appreciate the sentiment I just wish it wasnt in front of the whole class.Im pretty sure most of this is my depression talking but its definitely making my AvPD symptoms worse. I feel like EVERYBODY is looking at me. Im beating myself up all the time for what I dontcant do. I feel like everyone hates me. I hate myself. I just want to hide. Curl up into my corner. Never speak to a soul.,Personality-disorder
51116,In the past people have commented on how I make them feel like they can open up to me and that I am natural. What I find bizarre is that I never seem to easily recall all the positive feedback I've received.Instead I focus on the negative feedback that occurred way before then.As someone pointed out this is a glaring example of AvPD.Many of us never felt emotionally secure as children which led to our insecure attachment styles and avoidant personalities.I'm trying to take radical responsibility in order to address all of my issues now though.,Personality-disorder
51246,AvPD is neglected disorder So there are beliefs that AvPD is caused by neglect of parents or caretakers.And then when you grow up you realize you have this and even this disorder itself is neglected.So individuals having this disorder are basically neglected in every way for their entire life. From parents neglecting them to society neglecting their disorder. ,Personality-disorder
51525,Just wonder if people have heard of hypersensitivity. Im a Highly Sensitive Person or HSP but I realized I was being super sensitive for awhile now. I think this is when I started to realize my AvPD. I was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it. Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive. I think a lot of this comes from trauma. Also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general. I dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas. Ive been doing that alot more lately. It took a really long time but I feel less stuck now.,Personality-disorder

My problem How do I find out if I'm completely delusional or if there might actually be something to it? If I just ask my therapist How do I know I don't have AvPD? it may come across as extremely knowitall and pushy. Aside from that I have many questions and concerns what if I was misdiagnosed because I misdescribed my problems?I'm really sorry to write in this subreddit. It's just that I just panicked again because of an incident.Thanks for reading I really appreciate it.,Personality-disorder

I'm getting older and I hate how much I keep needing to interact with people I don't have anyone in my life other than my parents but even they are on my last tiny nerves... except we've been needing eachothers help a lot. They're old and need help I'm getting older and sometimes need help when im getting sick or life happens. This flop era is turning into a flop lifetime. I'm drained seeing people. I just want to wake up 1 day in my own place and hear complete and total silence never cross paths with another human being never make eye contact or play the dumb game of social interaction and just have enough... stuff to get my needs met.

51237,This shit SUCKS cant even freely express yourself and connect with people Being ugly has made me feel like a FUCKING ROBOT. Im sooo fucking jealous of everyone everywhere. Everyone at my job has these personalities that they just express without thinking of how the other person will perceive them. They crack lame jokes witty jokes and everyone laughs and accepts it and they all act like theyre brothers and sisters. Of course Im the fucking outcast who is quiet all the time and doesnt say anything but robotic one liners. BECAUSE I FEEK LIKE THATS ALL I CAN DO. Anytime Ive tried being funny and more comfortable I got shot down so many times. People would say who tf says that shut up or just flat out ignore me opposed to how they laugh with each other and and add on to each others jokesI feel like I have to constantly watch what I say every fucking time Im talking to anyone. People have said kobes weird hes too quiet hes a loner but like Im only quiet cause I feel like people will consider me lame and annoying if I try expressing myself and talking to them its not fair no one else has these fears and Im essentially trapped in my brain locked out from making any meaningful connections The worst part is I dont even think this is fixable. Its been this way for basically my whole life. Like whenever I tried to take a leap and express myself Ive mostly been shot down and looked at like I was special needs and its dehumanizing and isolating I dont know what tf to do. Im so sick of being cursed to ugliness and this sub I just want to live my fucking life and connect with peopleI feel like when YOURE ugly youre not allowed to really express yourself and joke like everyone else because people will automatically take offense to it So unfortunately even tho I want to connect with people I stay to myself cause I feel like Im unbearably boring and awkward and like people dont like me and would rather not talk to me soo fuck,Personality-disorder

51000,How does one with AvPD even begin to entertain the idea of being in a romantic relationship? To me the idea of being in a relationship like that is the ultimate danger as the level of intimacy in that dynamic is as high as it can possibly be in life. It is just hard to comprehend myself being able to deal with something like that because the fear is overwhelming. For this reason this is one of the hardest things for me to work on despite making inroads in other respects.I have learned to personally engage with people in a platonic way although I have a sort of mental dissonance that keeps most social interactions at a superficial level. But it seems like that is not a possibility with romance which is why I have not been able to adapt or understand how to even go about it. This is why like many other posts I have come across on here I have virtually no experience at 27.I'm wondering how others have even begun to be able to make an effort to seek one or even be in one as the possibility of rejection and having to be emotionally open is amplified. I realize that avpd obviously is an individualized experience and other social dynamics might be more difficult for others and this is not me saying that I believe those in relationships are lying about their diagnosis of course. It's just moreso that I have a difficult time relating and understanding how you guys who have succeeded in this have made this progress.,Personality-disorder

Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent.

If it's that easy I wouldn't be missing school for months. It fucking sucks that EVERYONE is undermining everything we are going through. They don't realize how this affects our literal lives. They don't see how severe this is just because they can't see our disorder. When will the time come where people take mental health seriously? If this was a physical disorder this would've been treated a long time ago. The school doesn't even take my situation seriously. They are basically telling me to get over it. They are so fucking lucky they don't get to experience what we go through. It's not like we asked for this. Fuck I hate people SO MUCH. Literally the only people who sympathize with us is those who have AvPD too literally only the community itself.

Im supposed to be graduating this semester yet Ive gone to none of my classes or done any of the work. I have no motivation and I feel that I legitimately dont deserve my degree. Im withering away and dont know where to start fixing this mess. It bothers me that Im failing out but not nearly as much as the fear of how my abusive family will react to having to bail me out of trouble again. Never mind how it feels to still be so controlled as an adult. Ive already had to withdraw one semester for mental health purposes and I cannot bear having to admit that Im in an impossible situation once again. And they dont even believe Im mentally ill. I dont need their approval I just need to not be verbally ripped apart. It would take too long to describe how cruel my family can be but it is enough that I am living in a full breakdown trying to keep this lie holding together. My dad once called me a 23 year old loser and I keep proving them right. And yet Id willingly take abuse over the solitary confinement I live in now.

I get that surge of okay I can do this i wait till i get home from work the text was in the morning and I write a reply and send it explaining how im not in a great head space atm not able to be around people but hopefully I will be able to see her soon. She sends me the sweetest reply back I look at it and nothing. I don't feel any anxiety or anything I just don't want to reply I dont know whyyy. And now im sat here feeling awful about myself that I didn't reply to her. Is this a relatable thing to anyone? I feel like im just a shitty awful selfish person.,Personality-disorder

51061,Went to school today to get a confirmation that I will be dropping out principal scoffed at my situation. My teacher already told me that it's impossible for me to continue the next semester. I already know that but she told me it needs to come from the principal itself for confirmation. So we went to him just for the confirmation. Now the principal went on and on about me coming to him begging for a second chance... Which i didn't. I just went there for a confirmation. I already know they're not gonna give me a second chance. I didn't come there to beg.He then went on about how I don't really have anxiety because if I do have anxiety I would have found a way apparently he knows because he has anxiety too. The thing is I DON'T HAVE ANXIETY. AVOIDANT PERSONALITY DISORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM ANXIETY. He then said I'm just making excuses and I just got lazy. I'm not asking them for second chances I know right from the start they are not gonna accept me anymore but I don't appreciate them making fun of my shitty mental health. That's the thing with this disorder we literally avoid things to the point where it affects our whole life. He was acting like i went to his office crying and kneeling down begging to give me a second chance he said I know why you came here to ask for a second chance when I literally just sat in front on his desk and agreed that they can't give me another chance. I wouldn't have come if I knew he was gonna make fun of my disorder. I only came because my teacher said it needed to come from him for it to be final. Now everyone thinks I'm just making shit up. It also doesn't help that my country doesn't have a GED. I wonder what their faces would look like if I killed myself? Wouldn't it be funny? They make fun of my mental illness and then the next day they get the news that I killed myself?,Personality-disorder
51310,My life is wasting away while everyone is building a good future for themselves. It seems like everyone I know is set for their future. My two best friends are currently studying in big reputable schools studying chemical engineering and business something that will help them achieve great goals in the future. While I'm here rotting away in my house doing the same thing everyday because I'm to fucked up in the head to go to school and finish high school. I'm afraid everyone would move on with their lives and I'd have to deop out of school and repeat again. I would be graduating at 20 when I should have been graduating at 18. It would be completely ok if I was rich but I'm not. I can't afford to slack all day and do nothing but my pathetic brain stops me from doing anyhting. Before my country adopted the k12 curriculum everyone graduated at 16 goes to collegeuni for 4 years and graduated at 20. Now I'm barely graduating at 19 years old. It feels like everyone I know is gonna be rich and successful in the future and I'm just gonna be here rotting my life away.,Personality-disorder

50903,what to say to those who you ghosted and what they might say I know some people are happy to cut ties with people but others feel guilty or anxious about cutting ties and freeze because too much time has passed. If someone reached out to me and said something along the lines of struggling with personal things that would be so helpful even if much time has passed. The people who you have ghosted are probably hurt and confused and the truth is they probably internalized it as something THEY have said or done wrong. If they did not do anything wrong that is something to highlight.Hi. I just wanted you to know that I have been struggling with some personal things and that's why I haven't reached out. I am still struggling and not ready to maintain friendships just yet. But I do want to let you know I care. I'm sorry if I have left you hurt and confused. It was not something you have done wrong. I am not in a place to explain further but I do hope you are well.Some people may be understanding and some people may still be reeling from the hurt and not respond at all or they may decide that they do not want to open the door back up to having contact with you now or in the future because they felt that they were rejected and don't want to risk that again. Rejection hurts people without mental illness too! That is not necessarily a rejection of you but more of a reflection of the place where they're at mentally. It may have taken them a while to move on from the relationshipfriendship. Some people may feel that keeping that door closed is protecting them from getting hurt again. In my opinion that is more than a fair response so before you do reach out if you decide to you have to mentally prepare for whatever decision someone will make. One way to look at it is you get the chance to prepare for their response when they never got a chance to prepare for being ghosted unless you let them know you ghost at times.,Personality-disorder
51448,how to get over fear of therapygetting help i'm 18 and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but i'm so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as 'what if i misinterpret a question and answer wrong' or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful. i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist. i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it. i want help and i don't want things to get worse but i don't know how to go about it. any advice on how to overcome this fear or services available that i should start with?i'm from the uk btw,Personality-disorder

I've been on this subreddit for a good period of time now and it's quite an active one with several posts every day and pretty much all of them receive a response of some sort whether it's about people asking for advice or venting. There's no toxicity. There's no arguing. There's just empathy and help.

51488,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling... Just want to put this out there and wondering if others are the same way.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wkz3v,Personality-disorder
50740,I haven't replied to someone for 30 weeks . Thankfully this person was not a close friend at all they were an acquaintance but God I feel so embarrassed that I never replied. What must they think of me . Because we were only acquaintances this person literally won't miss me but it's moreso the fact I've probably came across as extremely rude that is upsetting. I'm not sure if I should just leave it now or if I should message and apologise and tell them I won't be replying anymore. I should have done this aggges ago and told them that I won't be replying anymore instead of just avoiding for 30 fucking weeks.I think messaging to let them know what happened would be a good idea but I should have done it she's ago. If I did it now I would feel so anxious about messaging them. Maybe they hate me now and don't want me to message them ever again. Idk guys .Edit I don't think I will message them because there isn't really any point the friendship is obviously over and I don't plan on trying to reignite it I wish I could but it's too difficult. I did briefly tell this person that I have issues with replying to people so I'm praying that they won't be mad at me and instead would have attributed my absence to this.

51443,Once people get to know me they tend to love me... They only problem is they never get to know me because the only possible way they will is if I am forced to be in a situation with repeated exposure to them in which case I become familiar and slowly open up over the span of a week or two. It's downright disturbing how many times this has happened in my life and it's depressing to think that those opportunities are few and far between now that I'm out of the primary environment they occur school. I was so desperate at one point that despite having everything people normally strive for great career money success etc. I thought about joining the army just to meet people... Holy shit what is wrong with me.,Personality-disorder
51001,I know this probably isn't AVPD but sometimes I suspect I have a bit of it due to symptoms but that doesn't mean anything School sucks. All I do is hide the bathroom every break time to avoid social interactions because I also know there isn't anywhere to go or sit. If there is a place in the library I hope that nobody sits next to me or looks at me. I think people stare at me but when I look up they're not. I wish school days went faster and feel like I get anxiety attacks.I avoid making friends at school because I feel inferior to people. Like I don't deserve them and they're much better having someone else as a friend than me because I have 0 social skills and stress to maintain friendships. I try to seem mildly interesting by having hobbies but i know it isn't enough. I sometimes feel severely lonely and depressed at school and at home but try to distract myself from that. I don't speak a word at school. Somedays I dissociate and everything feels like this isn't my home or I'm dreaming.I think this is just general social anxiety but do any of you relate? BTW I'm not trying to self diagnose. I just need some help...,Personality-disorder
51537,I cant sustain long conversations It doesnt matter who the other person is if we are engaged in a conversation the longer it takes the more symptoms I get. At first I am ok then the worry begins in my head where at the same time I am talking I start observing myself. The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear my ears turn red my lips start to shake my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. Later on as days pass I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. After sometime I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. I am 56 and have been like that since High School. Some medications have helped particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes. This is all from times in my childhood where I was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts uncles grandparents and teachers. One of my grandmas used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when I did something bad. So for some reason now when I talk to other adults it triggers all of the reactions I had as a child when I was getting yelled at.,Personality-disorder
50722,I wish I could socialize normally and make friends No matter what social setting Im in Im always the odd one out. I feel like I physically cant talk. I only speak when someone initiates and even then the conversation just ends almost instantly cause of my bad social skills. I wanna be normal and be able to make small talk and actually have relationships with people. I feel so alone and I dont know how to change. Im 22 and wish I could have friends and go out like other people my age. Was considering going to the Disney college program but I know itll just be the same no friends and Ill just be the weirdo everyone avoids. Please I really want to change my life I need some advice.

51517,Lack of opinion and interest in things Anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? New show comes out new game comes out new trend im always late to it all. I always find myself saying the phrase thats a thing? when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else hasI seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is I hate it and 10 is I love this and will skip sleep to do it the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I love. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times Im just not that into it as the people around me. One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea but like this happens with everything I tryOr when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just heard was a highly paid major without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking what jobs it would train me for hell whether or not I even liked it. It was just ok sounds good. One of the most important decisions of my life made in 10 minutes. And now senior year I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.Makes me think about how many opportunities Ive missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life. IdkI'm asking on this sub mostly because I'm curious if this is related to avpd or not. Or if its more a personality thing,Personality-disorder
50523,I think I have AvPD avoidant personality disorder I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off Im very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping. I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. Im not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level. I dont really open myself up to anyone. Im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. Im close enough with my parents that I dont get anxious around them however I still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. I have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. Whenever Im at work I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience I overthink everything and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like Im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when Im asked questions and I dont feel like Im much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by. I play it safe. Ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like its more than just that.,Personality-disorder
50784,Im so desperately lonely I want more than anything to have connections and close friends but at the same time Im scared of anyone getting to know me. I get so remorseful of the fact know one really knows me or gotten to know me properly and Ive never felt like I could be my full self around anyone and its all my own fault. I feel like Im not good enough to have friends or acquaintances whenever people talk to me or give me the time of day I feel like theyre just doing it out of pity or theyre just talking to me so they can laugh at me to feel better about themselves.,Personality-disorder
50733,I need to get better I am scared because I had to do something today but postponed it to tomorrow. Planning to wake up at 4am to do it but it's 12pm already. I had to send an email to a coworker explaining how far i reached in solving an issue so they can take over but i have made 0 progress in it even though i took 2 fucking weeks for it. I also can't say that i didn't make any progress because i told my boss otherwise. I just don't start my work itself because I am too scared to encounter new issues that i won't be able to solve. Procrastination is fucking me up. I don't even know what or why I am typing. I feel i just keep feeling sorry for myself and don't really do much to improve.Anyways I am preparing side by side for a career shift but i dont see how it would be much better as the issue mainly lies with me and everyone in my job are great people. I just think way to hard on how to appear a certain way to others because I base my self worth on others opinion of me which I am trying to change but honestly don't see it getting much better.I went to different psycologists and psychiatrists in the past but never sticked to any. My mind kept finding reasons to not continue even tho some of the meds helped me at the time. I will probably go to a therapist again. Thank you if you read so far. I need friends who can understand my situation and want to get better too. Any resources links or advices you can offer for my situation are most welcome thank you again.,Personality-disorder
50834,Jesus taught avoidance I'm certain I'd be diagnosed with this disorder and many prophets would too.John the Baptist for example lived in the wilderness until he started his ministry. Now that is dedication!There are many verses related to AvPD in the Bible I'll post some at the bottom.I avoid everyone but Jesus because he is infinitely loving and wise and talking to other people is TORTURE in comparison.I've experienced this phenomenon in my life many times and I see it constantly across every facet of life friend groups businesses etcIf a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand. Mark 324It seems that we have realized no matter who or what we come into contact with it's only a matter of time until it falls apart.I would argue this is not a disorder but wisdom.In fact I would encourage everyone to lean into this!Whatever can be shaken let it fall.Jesus Christ is the only solid foundation. He is the only thing valuable enough to unite around.Without Christ it WILL fall apart your new social circle workout plan job hobby... Don't settle for second best. Don't put your faith in a priest pastor friend partner family... Go straight to the source!He's waiting for you to call out.You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. Jeremiah 2913 Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks the door will be opened. Matthew 778AvPDDo not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world love for the Father is not in them. 1 John 215You adulterous people dont you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. James 44If you belonged to the world it would love you as its own.

51197,Felt Not Good Enough I was going to go to a meet up group that eats different food around the city and then I canceled. I was so excited and hopeful about making friends but then I realized how since I got divorced I look so much older and so much chubbier.... I felt I would be able to sense by their reaction to me that I am not good enough and I don't belong. So I canceled. I feel sad about it. Also I never have money and I had a little extra cash so this is one of the few times I was going to be able to afford this group. I just don't have anyone to talk to about this and I feel sad and silly.,Personality-disorder
50563,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure egodystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are egosyntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? Like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality-disorder
51139,People don't take this disorder seriously enough. They're acting like we're just doing this to be lazy. It's not our fault our brains are like this. My birth giver is nagging and cussing me out for not going to school I understand that this could be frustrating for a parent but I already told her about my problem with going to school I risked that knowing that she's narcissistic and judgemental but even after all the explanations she still thinks going to school for me is easy. She then goes on to say kids these days are so onion skinned which means someone who has shallow tears and then goes on and say I didn't spoil you kids.Didn't it ever occur to her that maybe I'm like this because she abused us as children? That she screams at us every chance she gets? That she didn't treat us with respect and neglected us? It's not just kids these days people have been battling with mental health for hundreds of years it's just popular now because people actually value mental health now and are seeking for help.It's so funny because she acts so caring and worried when talking to my teacher but then acts so judgemental and close minded when talking to me.,Personality-disorder
50999,Therapy Success for AVPD? Anyone? Ive only recently discovered my disorder falls into AVPD 6 of 7 characteristics. Ive been going to a psychiatrist for years whos treated me for depression Zoloft. Ive always been shy overly self critical etc. Ive been to 5 Therapists over the last 20 years none have really helped me. Weve identified the causes of my AVPD very critical parents physical abuse. . Sexual abuse in Jr High. However thats a far as I get. The rest is just talking about my feelings. I get 6 to 9 mos in and I feel like Im just saying the same stuff. So I quit. Has any AVPDsufferers ever had success with Therapy? What does success look like? I cant even imagine. Are you more socially successful and bulletproof from criticism? What methods did you use in Therapy that made you successful? What did you do beyond talking about your traumas that helped you?What kind of Therapist was helpful in getting passed or improving? Is there some specialization or kind of therapist that is more successful with AVPD? Thx.,Personality-disorder

51322,Fear is the death of potential comfort it's instrument. Deep down I'm still that poor scared little boy who lost his confidence beaten and humiliated and alone. So desperately alone Beyond that and deeper perhaps is a skeleton where the man should be held together by wishes and fantasies of what it means to be of what it means to deserve and the empty bravado and bloviations of a synthetic confidence made of air. Now I can play the role of the confident man. I can laugh and smile and charm and begile and speak with an iron certainty that brooks no argument and most would be tricked into thinking this is strength but these are nothing more than the desperate craven thrusts of defense a pained and insecure theatre to hide my own inadequacy from inquiring eyes. I feel so worthless so replaceable so expendable. If I am not the absolute best then how can I be valuable at all? How can someone not replace me? How can I feel secure within my relationship with others? Everywhere I look I notice others better than me. People who are better looking taller smarter with nicer bodies and I cannot escape the realisation that these people could replace and take from me everything that I hold dear. I have an adoring girlfriend but how long will that last? How can I trust in permanence when so many better than me exist? When the wheels of fate are always in motion spinning towards a yet unknown destination? Every man man is my rival. Every man is better than me. I must be perfect otherwise I am worthless. Somewhere along the way during adolescence and early adulthood fear gripped my heart. It squeezed and twisted me into submission until I felt powerless to travel any road that was not certain and safe. In persuing safety I was tricked into embracing comfort which came for me in the from of constant daily drinking. For five years I drank and drank and isolated until I was emaciated malnourished alone so desperately alone wasted pitiful weak hopeless and broken. The indifference and apathy that was birthed by alcohol facilitied me leaving university abandoning the future I had dreamed of since a small boy and finally extinguishing the withering flame of hope that I did not know still existed inside of me.I slept on empty rum bottles littering a dirty and dark floor in a small room. I seldom washed or showered or ate and I only left the house to buy enough alcohol to fuel my twoletresaday rum habit. I was so alone so desperately alone. I spent over half a year without any communication with others at all and then only interacted with basic pleasantries in the couple of years that followed. Yet somehow against all predictions I stopped drinking. That was almost two years ago now. Since that moment I have not faltered once nor did I ever fear doing so. I was at rock bottom I knew that I could not drink anymore. The realisation hit me suddenly with force sufficient to stop me mid step on my way to buy rum. A voice in my head clear and confident and smooth stated you can't do this anymore and thus the decision to never drink again was made. And I cannot go against decisions already made in the same way I cannot reverse the motion that broke a glass against the floor. From that moment I have worked hard to build myself up from the creature I was. Now on the precipice of achieving two years of uninterrupted sobriety I have a new respectable fulltime job I workout five times a week I have a loving girlfriend and yet I am haunted by the immutable weight of my own inadequacies and regrets. Everyone around me is more successful than I am. My girlfriend is currently on a buisness trip abroad surrounded by other people of stature significance and importance. And what am I? An addict a university dropout and a worthless talentless static waste of life. I know that I cannot compare my life and success to others. Every person you meet has travelled a different path to yours with different privillages and struggles and a completely different set of potentials. I should only reflect on the life I have lived judging my success by the progress I have made. I understand this logically. It makes sense... Only I cannot help but compare. I want to be more. So much more. I need to be more. I want to go back to university but I fear I am not smart enough. I had no confidence in going in the first place but it was a path I was on so I did not dwell on the fear. Now with the flow of this path disrupted I cannot find within myself the confidence to take the plunge back into formal education. I am inert with doubt. Why is it I cannot move past my regrets? Why do I feel so inadequate?,Personality-disorder
50998,Might i have avpd? Alright before i start i want to say that im 16. Ive been showing some symptoms as long as i can remember but i hate self diagnosis so i want some help. Because i dont want to have a pdobviously Ive been extremely shy and untrusting of others ever since i was a small child. Im often rude and cold to people bc im extremely afraid of someone talking to me and try to make them think im not talking to them bc im arrogant and not a loser whos afraid of everyone. But im more like the second. Ive always been insecure also i had a history of self harm. But i did that because i feel like im not enough and dont deserve to even breath the same air as most people not because im suicidal. I had suicidal thoughts a lot but i never considered doing it because im too much of a coward for it. I also project my insecurities on people a lot and try to find someone inferior to me to communicate. Ive felt inferior for so long that i want to be superior to someone so i project my insecurities and drag them down. Im not jelaous by any means i just want someone inferior to me. I dont think i even need to mention i have no friends and push anyone that tries to talk to me bc i suspect theyre bullying me. But i have good relations with my family even though they also make me a little anxious. And i have a diagnosis of gad,Personality-disorder

51402,I am hurting Lately I just feel like garbage. I havent left the house much in like 2 weeks and I've been missing class. It all feels too overwhelming for me but being at home makes me feel like trash too...I cant win. I cant sleep right either. I wake up every other hour and im so tired....I feel so angry and anxious lately too because I feel as if everyone hates me and that they're happier without me. My friends hardly talk to me lately. I see them on social media chatting and making plans to callplay games and im never included lately. Im not surprised though. Who'd want to be friends with someone as depressed and broken as me?I want to crawl in a hole and disappear ,Personality-disorder
51538,Feeling disconnected from peers how do I stand out to fit in? Hi I've been struggling a lot in school from even before college and lonely for most of my life. I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising I can't seem to use social media well too afraid that my relatives will find it andor hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange? I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long I want to express myself and find a space for my art craft and ideas that accepts me for me.And I'm sure in order to be independent I need to also be comfortable with myself.But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down. I feel like a NPC living a scripted life.How do we overcome this and have the courage to live for us? Can I do it in a way to eliminate these stresses? Or is avoiding them the main issue?,Personality-disorder
50584,AvPD diagnosed recently Hey all I was diagnosed with AvPD quite recently and finally I guess after all those years spent in confusion what is wrong with me. I finally got an appointment at psychologist we were doing for the first few hours screening process turned out I do have AvPD and I met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with BPD. Also he mentioned that I do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. But after I read his diagnosis this evening he wrote that I have Other personality disorder. Which idk how I feel about that. Like I do not belong to anything even in this. And when I started to talk to him about feeling really depressed and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today he just said that we will talk about it next time in a two weeks. And I am so confused about this like no one really care especially with the suicidal thoughts. And feeling I do have no one to talk. Or maybe I dont want to? I dont know. But this is making me super super lonely and more depressed. No one really cares..,Personality-disorder
51353,I dont understand how to getdo jobs Why are the descriptions of every job so alienating? Like I just dont get why they write them like that. Not everyone they hire is a good communicator or excellent at whatever or fast paced. Fuck Im middle aged and I cant do anything. Yes a bunch of that is the shame voice but so? It feels like everything is constantly rejecting me by putting barriers everywhere and Im already fucking exhausted from having to be alive. I just feel so dejected about doing literally anything for money. Its been my most difficult barrier and all I want is someone to be gentle with me so I can trust them and give working a shot. But if they only want people with social and other skills they already dont want me so how is that fair?,Personality-disorder
51287,My face looks younger than its 39 years and I think its because Ive worked my whole life to keep it as expressionless as possible and not reveal all the turbulent and contradictory feelings underneath. As a kid I was often mistaken as mature beyond my years. At least I dont have to worry about smile lines. Through selfconscious terror Ive managed to suppress any impulse to have a spontaneous social reaction.,Personality-disorder
50988,Thought I'm getting better I'm single approaching 30s have a stable job and stable family. Getting more skilled at my job recently really helped boost my confidence and I'm used to being a nonvoluntary lone ranger. I thought nothing could hurt me anymore.Yet today something simple triggered me. Someone I joined the company with got married yet I was not invited but few others were. This is not the first time this has happened. I can count on one hand how many times someone invited me and not as a second thought. Also the embarrassment when I only learned someone's wedding is coming when having a random group lunch and learning I was not invited yet trying to sidestep other's question if I'm coming. I always think they have a separate group chat with majority of them and always wondering why I'm not included. Maybe I'm too boring and not prettyfashionable like them.I've long come to terms with the fact that people are just not interested in me since I was a teenager. Always not being invited being left out of information or plain rejected to my face. I never have a romantic relationship and no guys ever show interest in me. All the vague 'friends' term I use whenever I talk to my mother to hide the fact that her daughter was all alone ever since she entered university.It just hurts so bad and reminds me so much of my teenage years. One day I wish I'll have a partner who always puts me first in his thoughts. Thanks for reading my rant.,Personality-disorder
50549,My friend expressed that she is disappointed in me. Long story short I felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class. I didn't show up for this class in forever and didn't turn in much work so she was worried I'd procrastinate like I did in 1 semester and fail.When I said I'll probably skip again she looked at me with so much disappointment and said I really should stop caring about people that much.It didn't register then but it hits me now how hurt I am from her words. It feels like I'm not doing good enough and I probably am not. So that day I forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. But I can't get the look on her face out of my mind.To be fair to her I said I needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. So maybe she didn't think I felt as horrible as I did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.,Personality-disorder
51232,Hello new here Hello everyone lurker for a small while now. I'm 24M.I'm in the process of getting diagnosed cause my life is shit and I continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship. Everything points to AvPD according to the psychiatric place I'm being diagnosed in so I figured I'd check out the sub some time ago. I resonate with a lot of people in here so I felt like I'd chip in a bit.I've essentially lived in complete isolation for 34 months now except to buy groceries on sick leave from my vocational school only very rarely seeing family in that time. All social interaction is through online games not that this has ever really been much different which I do think help ground me a bit more in reality. I know that some of you guys have gone years without even that and I'm sorry to hear it. I want to get better finish my education have one or two friends a Roma tic relationship and a job. But life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen seriously fuck living like this.I'm getting a little hope from knowing more about AvPD and that I most likely am about to be diagnosed so I can get help but even still I've had times today where I just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. I'm scared of getting hurt so I've never attempted suicide even though I've fantasized about it a lot. I also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear.Anyways onto more nondeath related shit earlier I ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat. I really hope they got the note cause I look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths. Besides my apartment looks so bad I'd rather not have anyone look inside so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace.That's all I have for today besides all the shit everyone here struggles with I wish you the best possible day,Personality-disorder
51039,I will soon be kicked out of the apartment And I don't know what to do I have some little money and currently have a remote job but I maybe will loose it soon maybe next month they're not firing me just due to circumstances they may or may not close the studio it's not clear yet. Probably I can rent for a few months but everything is so overpriced so I'm not sure. And it's middle of winter. So anxious right now. I tried to look for a job online but didn't find anything there's nothing irl cause I live in small shithole town and I probably won't be hired that way anyway. But I didn't actually try hardly to find anything just sitting on my ass procrastinating. Don't even have any friends or even acquaintances so.. ,Personality-disorder
51226,Realizing that the world doesn't care about your feelings and your lifestory is sort of liberating. It's helping me resolve my avoidant characteristics.It's helping me fight off people's neuroticism and hystericism.,Personality-disorder
50571,Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I selfdiagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic paranoid insecure and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my trauma is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did but they felt really sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself and nobody did for me.This person lashed out at me calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and honestly that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.This person wasn't wrong but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back it felt nasty and unwarranted.Still though it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends a few years since those bad exchanges occured and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my selfesteem and it still does.When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like I wanna die to myself like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more normal again though.Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered offtopic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.,Personality-disorder
50659,Longtime lurker with AvPD just wanting to vent about the fantasy of disappearing and starting a different life Using my alt throwaway because reasons. Recently Ive been having a hard time and although I have deeply caring and wonderful people in my life I still isolate and as much as I crave time with others I get tired so easily after a short while. Also grew up with cluster B parents and family which doomed me to some kind of mental problems. Lately Ive begun to think about the idea of just leaving. Disappearing no trace. Not suicide. Im not suicidal at all I mean leaving going somewhere Im not known changing all my details and completely starting over. I cant help but feel it would make no difference to anyone in fact it might even be better.Ive googled step by step how tos on it.Im hoping to be able to talk to others who have been in this dark of a place and what got you through or any advice.Because this is mostly just a fantasy but the idea is sticking in my head more than Id like it to. I dont actually want to go through with it. I think Edit for clarity what got you through the mental state if youve felt this way not advice on disappearing. Oops!,Personality-disorder
51572,Societal Standards Not sure if this is just me but the more I self reflect the more i realize that im unhealthily antisocial but ok with that until i feel societal pressure to be different. Ive always been a loner and i can be like that ALL the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who arent like that and find it weird. Its almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because thats what you need for a happy life apparently but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure theres literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess Im deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and cant relate to others and feel insecure about it like I wish I could be in the standard of whats normal but Im also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy its hard to put into words how I feel but its like Im so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people dont live their lives like that. I dont want to miss out but find it hard to change. I guess my behavior isnt normal but trying to fit in just makes my anxiety so bad. Hopefully somebody understands what I mean. I think this is just how it is when your mentality ill for a long period of time.,Personality-disorder
50503,Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives listening indirectly to their conversations while in public being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost in a way that no one could see me nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.Some of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life just some sort of play or movie.These days I been having the classic I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog idea and daydreams and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature never having to deal with socialization again only brief interactions for let's say buy necessary stuff from other people which I don't mind. I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.I guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection where I could be myself openly and comfortably but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry. I don't have patience for people anymore I'm tired I'm being judgy as hell and I'm activelly avoiding new people.,Personality-disorder
51206,I finally won my disability case! Hi everyone! I want to share hope if you struggle with your mental health. It took me about 2 years but on my 3rd appeal where I went in front of the judge I was granted disability for my struggles with my mental health! Im so relieved so happy to finally have someone recognize me for what I deal with every day. Im thankful for all the years I hopped from job to job struggling for this helped increase my monthly payment amount. It was worth it now. Now I can devote my full attention for healing and continue to better myself. Life is good Feels good to share something positive for once.,Personality-disorder
51228,Can you force yourself to talk to people? Two weeks ago I wouldve sworn I had avpd but I think maybe I just wasnt trying hard enough to talk to people all these years. Like part of me was scared so I gave up. Because now I am actually trying and it is getting easier. And Im forcing myself to talk and trying to be open with people and yes its hard as fuck and I still have social anxiety but I am actually doing it. Thoughts? Would it be a lot harder if I had avpd?Its still hard but the thing is it gets easier every time I talk to someone. And I was homeschooled and also had no social contact outside my family for like 8 months so I have a lot of inexperience.,Personality-disorder

50897,Looking for some good vibes Hello everyone I am writing this because I've been reading posts on this sub for the past week since I've learned about AvPD from my new therapist and researching about this disorder as I believe I also suffer from it and have a curiosity from you people.Unfortunately not to make anyone feel bad about it as I know this condition is very hard to live with but I have been trying to look for some success stories from people here or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life.So my question for you especially maybe for the older people here with the conditionor the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of success no matter how small what is your outlook on life? What advice do you have regarding managing this condition?Although I've also had a rough couple of days I'd like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help.Please share anything you'd like that might help me and others on this sub.,Personality-disorder
51347,Trying to wrap my head around all of this hear me out if you will So I'm 50 M diagnosed adult with high functioning autism. I have been lurking the schizoid community for some time because I have so much in common with the guys who post over there. Mostly it's the anhedonia that really strikes a chord with me.The prevailing attitude over at rschizoid seems to be this cavalier stance that loneliness is just a preference. Well I take issue with this. Myself I've been isolating on and off so much since even before puberty. Sure it kind of feels good to not have to spend cognitive energy on social stuff. But loneliness is taking a toll on me. My brain operates on use it or lose it and I feel that now more than ever. Especially since covid19.The more I isolate which is something I can do day to day without sacrificing too much in the short run the less high functioning I become. I guess I substitute beer vidyas and parasocially engaging on YouTube for the real thing. It's kind of working but I really miss intimacy and that human connection. I feel like I'm ever so slowly spiraling into insanity. ,Personality-disorder
50753,I made a friend for the first time since middle school when covid hit I became very isolated since I was doing school online but last school year I went back in person and there was this person that would approach me but I was too shy to really talk to him and I finally built up the courage this last september to actually approach him. I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving kind and patient. He's assertive out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful. His attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general. I feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space. Even tho i still struggle a lot having a supportive and caring friend has helped me tremendously and I'm planning to keep him around for a very long time ,Personality-disorder
51559,I came off as an asshole today and Im struggling with it I went to the mall to buy some fragrances and I came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers. There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women and theyre all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions I wasnt prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didnt wear anything currently then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didnt really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.This experience made me realize that I also act cold and assholeish to everyone thats not the people I live with or my mom. But thats also the only way I can speak to people so Im kind of stuck between dont socialize at all or act cold to everyone.,Personality-disorder

51283,I can't fathom getting or being in a relationship with someone who is normal. 1 If I told someone I was 27 years old and never had a romantic relationship in my life and have no friends at the moment they'd run for the hills and I don't blame them. That's a giant red flag and nobody even the most empathetic people want to stick around to find out the reason for that. I'm like an alien in the eyes of most people. How can somebody relate to not doing anything meaningful their lives and having the drive and motivation of a rock. Most people want to strive for something grand... I'm just content having my basic needs met.If someone would even give a freak like me a chance there would be no way they'd be able to tolerate me for too long. As a guy I'm sure the way I act is purely pathetic and cowardly to most woman out there. If she doesn't understand my mental illness she'll see me as not a real man because I'm so sensitive and anxious all the time about trivial things that most people don't even think about.Sorry about the pity post my family thinks one of my New Years goals should be to finally get a girlfriend... Easier said than done. I really don't think anyone would tolerate me and I wouldn't want to burden someone with myself. I'm convinced that I'd only be able to be with someone who has AvPD or SAD however destructive that relationship that may be.,Personality-disorder
50844,I was triggered while talking to an old school friend and crashed the interaction This happened 9 month ago.I M50 was being approached by a woman that was in the same class in school with me some 30 years ago. I was just loading groceries into my car when she drove past behind me and said loudly oh hey that's a familiar face... . I turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see her... we started to talk she said she has seen me in this supermarket before. We exchanged some small talk... what do you do where do you live do you still have contact with the people of the past... this kind of stuff. I already was kind of nervous because of the small talk situation but when the topic of the other people from the past came up i began to panic. The thing is that i was being bullied for the 5 years that I was in this class. Not from her she was always nice.But the time in this class left it's marks and I didn't want to have anything to do with the people from these circles after I was done there.So at the end of our talk she asked if we should exchange numbers... and i froze. There were just so many thoughts in my head but i couldn't say any of them because none of these were appropriate for a casual conversation after 30 years.A small part of me was flattered that she remembered me and cared to approach me.But all the other parts of my brain were actively persuading me why this was not a good ideawhen i exchange numbers i will have to be prepared for her to calltext anytime i don't like this.i clearly still have a problem with the old times and the people from the past.when i calltext with her then i will have to explain this sooner or later or just lie and pretend that these things did not affect me.this is not the kind of topic that i can casually bring up after 30 years so i can't explain this and don't think that i can lie either...besides if i exchange numbers then i will have to well talk... text... ask questions... like a normal person and since i live very isolated i kind of forgot how to do this.and what do i do if she wants to get a coffee... or meet others... it's better to just end this here now and not exchange numbers.but i can't say that i don't want to exchange numbers who does something like this? i would have to explain this.I was spiraling...I'm not sure how long i stood there saying nothing. I guess she could tell from my face that there was a problem.Then she said you don't have to say anything.I think I mumbled something like okay and it was really nice meeting you and we parted.I should have just exchanged the number and go from there.I really would have liked to be able to do this but i couldn't.I regret this now and i am constantly thinking if i should contact her I know her address but of course not her phone number so i would have to write a letter i guess and try to explain things.At least tell her that it really was nice seeing her and that my reaction or lack thereof was not because of her but had other personal reasons.But of course everything is much more awkward now than if i would just have exchanged the number...,Personality-disorder

51112,I think my social phobia is causing my job hunt procrastination I've been made redundant from my last 3 jobs the last one being extremely traumatic. I've had many extremely close friendships end. I was abused and bullied my entire childhood by peers and family. Now I can barely look people in the eye and can't say hello or respond to small talk in work environments because it induces so much anxiety about being hated and misunderstood. I avoid textingresponding to messages because people used to say I was annoying and replied too much. If we're looking at the evidence everything points to me being a fundamentally unlikeable and hated person. I used to be fantastic at short bursts of social interactions but smoked cannabis non stop to be able to do so. People liked my stoneddrunk persona more than sober me and now that I'm sober I feel utterly terrified of interacting with anyone. I can't even answer the door for food deliveries. I need a job to be able to afford medical treatment but I always get stuck at the cover letter aspect because I feel like as soon as people get to know me they start to hate me. Most of my work experience has been in customer service or sales based roles but I hated every role I've ever done. I dedicated my academic years to studying medicine and law but had to drop out of uni to heal some trauma and I haven't returned since. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone and stuck and my rejection sensitivity is through the roof. I'm so ashamed of my failures and obvious shortcomings that it feels impossible to try to sell myself to a job.,Personality-disorder

50971,suspecting avpd hi. i suspect i may have avpd or something related to it. id like to preface this post by saying that i started reading up on this disorder about an hour ago so clearly im not going to jump to any conclusions here or at least im not trying to. i just think its possible. i also have adhd and im on a waitlist to be tested for autism. if that helps.ive struggled with severe anxiety issues for years. almost all of them are related to how people are perceiving mei have intense anticipatoryperfomance anxiety i fear that people are either going to think i act strangely think im stupidincompetent or both which will lead to a general dislike. this fear has grown so large i assume most new people i come in contact with dislike me think im odd and talk behind my back. it got so bad that i dropped out of high school and havent been able to hold a job since i get overwhelmed very easily a combination of aforementioned fears and sensory overload. ive been unemployed for a long while because the idea of even searching for or applying to jobs sounds hopeless and its ruining my life. i always wanted to go to college growing up but im frozen with fear and unable to attempt going. i fear that even people very close to me that ive been friends with for years are talking behind my back and they dont really want me around. i love interacting with people for example my mutuals on social media sites but i become fearful when they get closer to me and we interact more often because im afraid that they wont actually like me if we chat one on one i wont fit into their group of friends theyre just pretending to like me theyll think im stupid etc etc. i have such an intense fear of rejection at every turn oftentimes hitting hard enough to feel physically painful. im doubtful because sometimes i can talk to people fine. the fear is in the back of my mind and sometimes it presents itself far more plainly but other times i dont have any issues interacting with people. talking to new people is also way easier since itd be far more upsetting if someone im already attached to decided they didnt like me and abandoned me. i also identify with borderline symptoms yet i constantly fear theyre not severe enough i would fall into the quiet bpd subtype. i rarely lash out. i isolate myself and agonize over my interpersonal relationships and the state of my life. sorry for the oversharing. i can elaborate or answer any questions. just please let me know what you think. anything is helpful.edit id like to add that im seeking a psychologist right now. im not in the absence of professional help. i just want to know what people who actually have it think.,Personality-disorder
50531,Storytime... Hey so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there most of us are still there let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. Alright so I was showering thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!So basically I'm part of a church group and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't liketrust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. Though I don't share everything these people are genuine and kind and they always make me feel safe. It's just that I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me. So as part of going on the trip I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team 9 people including me. I trust love and feel safe with everyone on this team and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. Anyways the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small mostly funny slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles my past my family all of it. And these are my friends they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though the medicine is kind of iffy really. Anyways I'm super anxious about it especially since I did something similar last year but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year I was so empty and emotionless. But of course nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. But it's not like that that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy. I'm much better now but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay but as soon as I was behind closed doors I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though everyone of us is sharing our testimony no matter how much it hurts we're going to be here for each other.If you've actually read this far I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.,Personality-disorder
50569,This is a bit of a weird question but does anyone else relate a lot to these anime titles? Mushishi Kino's Journey etc I've always wondered if this is something AvPD adjacent. Mushishi Kino's Journey Spice and wolf Girl's last tour Serial Experiments LainThey are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.Does this make sense?,Personality-disorder
51223,Can you be outgoing and have AvPD? I'm very worried about my brother 29 and not sure how to help him so I've been doing research and a lot of the characteristics of AvPD seem to match. He's my roommate and he hasn't worked in 2 years and just stays home all day on his computer the majority of his time and will not get a job. However his personality is very outgoing and he's like the life of the party when we he is out. He just doesn't want to do anything and my parents said he has been like this since he was a kid. I'm pretty sure he has expressed he feels like he wasn't good enough since he was a kid he's dyslexic so he was never able to get good grades and had to try lots of different schools etc. I don't know how to help him because he says he's fine and doesn't open up to anyone so I really have no idea what's going on in his head.,Personality-disorder

51372,Irritated with oppression Olympics between AvPD and Schizoid PD Tw angry rant ahead What the hell is the oppression Olympics between AvPD and SzPD all about with some people on this sub? There are all these casual mentions of things like well my life sucks but at least Im happy I dont have SzPD that keep showing up lately.Why not just say something about being relieved not having to experience social anhedonia? Its not the only symptom experienced by people with SzPD although it seems to be simplified into that.I dont understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they dont experience social anhedonia.Experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with Schizoid PD. It would be like saying people with ADHD are choosing to be inattentive.Also there is a lot more to SzPD then the one symptom that some people in this sub seem to be hyperfixating on.

51482,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling...

I think it does not work with people if you do not objectively help the person or intend to interact with them on a physical or visceral level rather than just talking about interests or random stuff.In theory I should just go ask people if they want to play certain games but it does not feel right if people just opening up about their personal lives or bantering with me makes me feel like trash.

51243,Tired of needing Communication Skills to survive in this world. As someone with a speech impediment Childhood Apraxia of Speech and currently undiagnosed AVPD along with selective mutism Its frustrating that this whole society seems to be based off social interaction. Im almost 18 and realized that I should be looking for a temporary job by then so Im not a complete failure living in their parents house no offense to anyone who does I set high standards for myself. I see everyone else around my age and younger getting the easiest jobs where they literally just have to sit at a cash register all day and they get some good money. Its frustrating me to my core as I can never get an easy job like them as I cant handle social interaction or talking. I try to look for alternative jobs but every single one of them pops up with Requires excellent communication skills or Verbal communication required. Even working as a stocker or in a kitchen apparently requires communication! For the life of me I can not communicate well with people as I automatically freeze up and go into panic mode inside. Even at the small school I volunteer at I can barely even force out a word I just do my job silently before leaving. They probably are only letting me help out of pity. I even considered being a police officer for a while until I realized that you needed communication for that too. Im more fucking scared of talking to people then of tackling down murders. Today my girlfriend was looking for tutoring jobs and I just cried seeing how easy it is for her and everyone else not having to even care about social interaction.

51461,I hate myself so much I met this guy on vacation and we hung out for two days at the pool. I'm a very socially anxious person but with him I felt like I'd known him for years. One night he told other teenagers that he liked me. They told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriend's here. I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. I was bullied at school for being the quiet kid in class and I would run to my parents hoping they'd comfort me. But they'd get mad at me for being so quiet and they'd blame me too. I used to go up to my room at night and sing myself to sleep someday my prince will come. Now he was finally here. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and got mad at our friends for telling me.He cut off contact with with me. I was so sad that the one person who saw me for the good I have to offer still gave it up. They broke up two months later and he looks at my social media. We're not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. Im not angry at him for being loyal. Im angry at him for thrusting me into this situation. Im sure it wasnt easy for him but I was the one that suffered the greatest. He got to choose between two girls. His girlfriend is a victim too but at least he tried to make things okay with her. And me? I had no intention of getting in the way of a relationship.

51171,The urge to disappear and start over. First I want to say that I am not diagnosed. I've seen quite a lot of posts about this urge to disappear on rSchizoidhttpswww.reddit.comrSchizoid and also rAvPDhttpswww.reddit.comrAvPD.I am kind of glad that I am not the only one who does this. I constantly delete my social media and start over. By doing this I also ghost all of my friends on Discord. With social media like Reddit Twitch and others creating new accounts isn't a problem for me because I don't post anything. I only keep my Steam account. I always knew it's not normal. I didn't know other people also struggle with this.My friends are annoyed whenever I come up with a new Discord account. I really don't want to talk to them about this. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings with people I know. I feel like they wouldn't understand me andor would judge me. Most of my friends I've known since 2017. I usually just come up with a dumb excuse like I forgot my password or something like that.I want to explain the weird urge I get whenever I feel like disappearing. Under a post there was this commentgtThere was a point where I realized I was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point I would get that urge to restart. Not just with accounts but with everything. I'd plan out how I was going to use an account build a new habit accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible and for a while follow through. Eventually I would drift off track a little let it eat at me and then give up and decide I'll start over and do it better. At this point I struggle to get to the I'm going to try stage and usually just don't bother. The apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more.This comment describes my situation very accurately. I feel almost exactly as this guy.Creating new accounts has become a routine. I feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything. It's kind of hard to explain how I feel..I ghosted my friends like 3 weeks ago. Throughout the weeks I've tried to start over but I always fail and just start over once again.. I didn't tell anyone I'll disappear. I deleted my Discord and now I'm gone. My friend texted me on Snapchat asking why I deleted my account. I just responded with something like yeah lol. Didn't even give an answer. Ever since then I haven't talked to them. I want to but I know I'm gonna disappear after a month. I also don't want to explain to them why I deleted my account because I can't even do it right now where I am anonymous.Probably a lot of mistakes very unorganized post but yeah.. I hate this. I just want to be normal. ,Personality-disorder

50640,Feeling disconnected from peers how do I stand out to fit in? Hi I've been struggling a lot in school from even before college and lonely for most of my life. I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising I can't seem to use social media well too afraid that my relatives will find it andor hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange? I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long I want to express myself and find a space for my art craft and ideas that accepts me for me.And I'm sure in order to be independent I need to also be comfortable with myself.But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down.

50537,How can I function with unwanted thoughts that don't go away? I am 22 years old and male. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and I relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with. I spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts. Can anyone relate? How can I function like this?,Personality-disorder

51519,This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do could have been done better and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now during my clinical rotations every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve. I am always reserved and quiet and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However this has backfired on me as I struggle to form connections and networks losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible which makes me feel hopeless. What can I do to sustain balance at least in my mind? In addition to this I am lonely and the effect on my alreadydamaged mental health is apparent. Last year I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable and I felt liked. But in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable whether I had anything interesting to say and whether they looked down on me. The gutwrenching anxiety became too much to bear and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media I see how new people have joined the group formed close friendships and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this mysterious aura around me but after a few more dates I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.I'm sorry if I went on for too long or sounded negative but I really needed to share my thoughts and emotions with those who can understand.

I live in constant guiltdread knowing that I have people in my DMs trying to contact me to hang out but my fear of embarrassment and awkwardness is freaking killing me. All ive ever wanted was to belong and be able to make friends but my brain literally stops me in my tracks. Its also necessary to note that I have ADHD primarily inattentive and once I take my medication Im lucky to have maybe 30min of adequate dopamine levels to push myself and reply. Sometimes I do reply but when I go back to baseline I just want to isolate and be in my dark room. I really feel like Im being tortured by my own brain. Its a terrible feeling to crave social interaction but to also be deathly afraid of the possibility that I could ruin everything and be viewed as an embarrassment.

50938,has avpd destroyed my personality? Of course personality has its meaning in avpd but when I said personality the second time I mean a person as in the things they like to do or what they talk aboutI've always been avoidant and I think it's rooted in multiple harsh rejections between age 5 and 12. I've come out with 0 interests to talk about besides drawing and 0 drawings to show because I don't want to show anyone. I don't show anyone anything and I don't tell them anything unless that conversation territory was already stepped into. Have any others experienced that where they're uncomfortable telling people about their interests that they end up with none at all? Or secret interests? For me I have a secret interest but I still can't get myself to talk about it with other people interested in it. It's like we start talking and I have no idea what to tell them.

I wanna know if you guys can relate to these points or notI try not to speak loudly on my own with myself so other people cannot hear you?I recall and get critical about any past conversation you had recently at times word to word?I don't want to meet or get confronted by someone to avoid getting questioned at about the very thing I fear that I lack? And I would be open to those questions once I fix those things.I feel I have so much potential.,Personality-disorder
51260,Nobody takes an interest in me so I stopped taking an interest in myself For as long as I can remember all my friendships have been due to me taking the initiative. Asking the other person about their life and making plans. If I stop doing this I stop having friends. I wonder what this says about me. The only thing that comes to mind when facing this fact is Am I that reprehensible?. And I know that sounds like I am expecting things of people but isn't a friendship supposed to be a 2way street? I feel so crushingly lonely when I think about all this. There's this video from Kurzgesagt about loneliness and in that they say that the feeling of loneliness has the evolutionary purpose of saving you from the threat of being excluded from the tribe. If these were the days when humans lived in tribes I would basically be deemed to not be worthy of survival.Every friendship that starts has so much at stake for me. I can't face another onesided thing. It's such a slap in the face like I'm not worth knowing. Which is why I avoid investing myself in anything nowadays.These strings of continuous unreciprocated experiences have left me incapable of taking care of myself. Everything I do for myself feels not worth doing. Even talking about myself feels like a waste of time. If I try so hard to be part of the world and it rejects me why should I care to survive at all?,Personality-disorder
51444,New to the communitydiagnosis Hey allI was just diagnosed with AvPD yesterday along with some other things and to be honest I still feel a little shell shocked. I'm still learning more about the diagnoses obviously but I wanted to ask what tips or lessons the community has for a newbie like me. What do you wish you knew when you were first diagnosed? I've been working on overhauling my brain for a few years and I want to avoid falling into a trap where I just give up before I can fail as it is my tendency to do.,Personality-disorder
51361,DAE have extreme anxiety in professionalperformance settings? I have a huge problem with anxiety at work and have very big problems with avoidance. My emotional difficulties have gotten to the point many times where I have made absolutely awful mistakes at work and have been too panickedincapacitatedcowardly to take responsibility for myself.Its become a negative cycle spanning years and I never seem to get better. Its decimated my self esteem and riddled my life with stress and anxiety and of course imposter syndrome in every professional situation with any decent level of responsibility. Under pressure I dont push through and rise to the challenge I completely choke and take my hands off the wheel in panicavoidance causing car crash situations and so much stress to those who manage me. If I wasnt working with family I would be fired and destitute as I feel I cant be trusted with anything.Everyone in my circle is very smart and high functioning and can take responsibility for themselves and be relied upon to get their jobs done. Im 30 and I cant take myself seriously as an adult. I suppose what I want to ask is if any of this resonates with you guys? Im just lost as to what is wrong with me to be so ineffectual and I feel so much shame.Apologies for the rant.,Personality-disorder
51160,Struggling to find a career Hey yall. Im currently in 3rd year university in science and although I find things interesting sometimes most of the time it just feels like killing time. Im still working on completing my first year compulsory courses as Ive taken a gap in between 1st year and now completing optional courses I thought were interesting. Honestly I feel like giving up at this point because I hate calculus and stupid prerequisites that have nothing to do with the degree environmental science. They also make you take a billion optional coursesout of a small restricted list in order to graduate. I feel like Ill never find a career option that Ill be satisfied with. The days feel so long i have no motivation or drive. I daydream most of the time and have a hard time focusing. I want to exist without being expected to give.. but thats nearly impossible without just being homeless. What do you have a career in and what has been your experience like working?,Personality-disorder
50680,I feel like Ive missed out on my teenage years Its so depressing to think people have spent all these years going out with their friends and partying whilst I was just on my own in my room. Ive always had barely any friends and never been in a relationship or had a paid job I only managed to start doing a few hours a week voluntary work a few months ago. I watch the people around me do exciting things and make new friends and get partners whilst Im just here bored alone and depressed as usual. It doesnt help that later this year Ill move away from this town for university and Ill probably never see most of the people Ive spent years wanting to be friends or more with but been too scared to talk to again. It feels like this phase of my life is really slipping through my fingers and I have no time to repair it. I try to tell myself at least I have the future where I could become better and make the next phases of my life better than this one but in reality I know that Ive just been declining for years so I doubt that very much.,Personality-disorder
50839,I think I may have AVPD anyone relate? Ive been in therapy on and off since 2015. Ive been diagnosed with Major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and bulimia. Recently Ive been diagnosed with ADHD too. Though recently Ive been thinking something more is wrong with me. Ive been in therapy and been on meds since 2015 with med increases and it helps but in stressful times or when I forget to take my meds I go back to the same thought patterns. Recently theyve been coming up. What makes me think its AVPD because for the past decade and a half Ive always felt inadequate and not good enough no matter what I do. Its rare for me to think Im good at something but even then I feel like Im bragging and being obtuse or being narcissistic. Objectively Ive had success Ive been to a reputable college and for grad school I went to an Ivy League school but I feel like its a fluke. I constantly feel like a nuisance and a burden. I regret and am critical with most of my reactions with other people and assume everyone is tired of me or thinks Im annoying even though no one says anything or gives me one statement like whats up with all the talking.I dont like to be the first one to call someone a friend because I want to make sure they feel like they are my friend. I dont want to impose myself on them and I assume they dont want to be my friend. Even some of my friends now I get into episodes where I assume they dont like me but because theyre nice they tolerate me. I dont like to reach out to them first because I dont want to bother them. I dont follow up with friendships because I dont want to bother anyone. Theres people that I loved to spend time with and liked them as a human but I dont want to bother them at all so I avoid. I dont really date. Ive had dating apps but I can only use them if I pay for the parts that lets me see who likes me first and then I go from there. Regarding jobsworking initially I would take the first job offer I got because they wanted me because I would assume Im not good enough for any other place. I tend to be the person since high school to primarily only speak until Im spoken to or is asked to speak otherwise I stay quiet. I only have a handful of friends that Ive known for at least a decade that I ask to hang out but otherwise I usually dont initiate conversations or social events. If I do it with high anxiety and expectation of rejection. Criticism is also detrimental to me. Ive gotten better at it in the past year or so but it still just debilitates me. I feel like a failure and want to run away when I get criticism. So basically because Ive been like this since high school currently 30 Im thinking I have AVPD. My job is social and interactive with people which makes it seem like I dont have it but my impostor syndrome is so high unless I get verbal confirmation from others that Im doing good. with everything else I assume Im a bad person and I need to isolate andor disappear with family and friends and coworkers. Does anyone else relate? I have a therapist and Im going to bring this up. TLDRI think I have AVPD because of my baseline fear of rejection criticism wanting to have close friends but feeling inadequate andor like a bad person and I dont want to initiate friendships or relationships unless they confirm they want to be my friend andor like me.EDIT I think Im looking for anyone who thinks this might be AvPD andor validation? Idk,Personality-disorder
51431,Do you think this a good description of our experiences? This is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called On The Outside Looking In by Daniela Grazia about her experiences with social anxiety. Ive used it to describe my experiences to others but I have both social anxiety and AvPD so I worry if Im not explaining from the correct side ?. Im also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two. I suppose it only matters in my head but it does matter.The quote one long one formatting issuesgtIt is a feeling that comes over me often an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die. In classes in coffee shops in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. It is the profound feeling of alienness.gtAt any moment in the group conversation something in me snaps. I look around the table at the other people blissfully talking and I do not feel like one of them. I am not one of them. I am different a foreigner an alien a stranger in a strange land.gtAnd then the urge to run away to hide to be away from the people comes up. Sometimes I fight the urge and stay on hiding my vast discomfort. Other times I do run away cursing the cowardice and the shame miserable in my misanthropy but secure in my solitude.gtThere is something in the faces in the voices of the others that I do not have. They are into the conversation. They live outside themselves I live inside myself. They talk listen and laugh I think listen and smile.gtThey are relaxed. I am not. I am never relaxed except when Im alone. Solitude is the only place where I can ever truly be known.gtYet I am not content with this. For the real me is lonely desperately lonely longing for intimacy friendship and love. I long to be able to relax to laugh to talk and converse amiably with other human beings. But I cannot. I idealize them in private and fear them in public.gtFear...fear drives the haunted mind. Fear tortures me gnaws at me and chases me from nearly everything I crave the most. But not even fear can conquer the longing the desperate longing the aching striving for meaning in life for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged the dreams unshared the life unnoticed.gtWhen I am alone I wish I was other people. When I am with other people I wish I was alone. This contradiction is slowly but ruthlessly destroying my soul.,Personality-disorder
50994,Oh god I just feel so soul crushingly alone I cant take it anymore! I dont know how to reach out to people online to make friends let alone my classmates in real life. My parents only ever want to talk to my sister on the phone. Im so isolated and deprived of any attention or social interaction I feel like Im going completely fucking crazy. I dont even know where to begin getting help through therapy! I know the first step is to even TAKE a step at all but I just get so paralyzed by terror I cant do anything whatsoever. My college has some counseling program theyre partnered with in this city but I dont know how to reach out and beg for help. I dont even know what words to use I need a script or something. Im 22 and I dont have a single close friend every time I take a personality quiz that has a question along the lines of how many close friends do you have and there isnt an option for zero a part of my soul dies. My boyfriend that I only stayed with out of fear of making him mad by breaking up with him broke up with me a couple weeks ago and the ONLY social interaction I had whatsoever following that was extremely explicit anonymous sexual harassment on Tumblr that still makes my skin crawl to think about but I didnt tell them to stop until a different anon said hey dont you think this is kinda predatory? because I didnt want to be the killjoy by asking for it to stop and anyway I was probably overreacting about the whole thing to begin with but now that thats over since I blocked a few of them and turned anon off Im back to zero socialization whatsofuckingever! Every desperate cry for help feels like Im just screaming into a vacuum I dont know how to get out of this fucking hole Im trapped in Im too goddamn spineless to claw my way out. Can anyone hear me?!?! I just want someone to acknowledge me directly for once I just want my classmates to invite me to lunch again they used to invite me daily last year but at some point it feels like they just gave up on trying to get me involved and now its all my fault I still dont have any fucking friends. At this point I dont even want to blame the AvPD I just want to blame myself for letting this shit perpetuate in my brain so much its like I let a mold spread in here and now its in all the wrinkles in my brain fuck.,Personality-disorder
51460,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure egodystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are egosyntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? Like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality-disorder

51490,i'm starting to realize that i'll probably never be able to truely connect with anyone i guess i have multiple friends but i've only ever thought of 2 of them as close friends. the rest i don't really talk to a lot. but i try so hard to connect with them and get closer to them but it just feels weird and forced and i can clearly tell that it's unreciprocated. it just makes me want to give up.and now i'm starting to realize that with even one of my closest friends we may not even actually be as close as i thought we were. we rarely if ever talk and when we do it's usually just short convos or in a group chat and i'm always the one that has to initiate conversations. i think i'm lucky if i ever get to have one genuine conversation with them once a month. it just kinda hurts to think about i guess.why can't i connect with people? why is it so difficult? all of my life i've avoided people and just wanted to do my own thing and the moment i try building meaningful connections with people they all fail.,Personality-disorder
51030,Speaking my mind when talking to my therapist I have no problem with being open and honest with my therapist. But no matter what I say I never feel like anything I ever say is true. I can talk about how sad I feel or what it feels like to have a conversation but somehow my brain always wants me to think that Im making stuff up or something. I have so many conversations in my head where I feel like Im able to express myself fully. But once Im talking to my therapist or anyone else for that matter its all just nonsense. It just makes me feel so god damn lonely and stupid.So I told my therapist about this and she suggested I make a recording or write whatever I want to say down so that I can express myself more fully. Anyone else have the same problem?,Personality-disorder
51060,Asking myself why do people like me so much? I have found myself asking this alot recently. Over the last couple weeks i've been invited out a bunch by friends and friends of friends. I went to a few of them but am still ultimately confused on being included in so many plans because i often feel like i'm not that interesting of a person. Not that i don't enjoy being included i do but at a certain point i felt overloaded.

But beyond that its like I have no personality. The only reason I can survive my office environment at work right now is because of an actual real and positive coworker. She has the personality that I wish I had easy to talk to and very kind. But shes leaving tomorrow.So Ive been faking my entire self.

50730,Im scared of going to college Im a senior in high school and after being on this subreddit for a month Im terrified of going to college. Granted I was terrified before that. Before I figured Id take a gap year to figure things out and I didnt feel like I was in a good position to do well in college. But now Im realizing I was just avoiding applying because I was scared to be rejected. Or maybe I was scared of what would happen if I was accepted. I dont know what I want to get into and its scary how relatable a lot of these post feel. And what scares me more is that I keep seeing posts about people having to tell their parents they dropped out of college. Is that going to be me??? Am I just going to be a drop out?? Should I even try?? I dont know but now Im worried Im going to get to comfortable once Im out of school and will be too scared to return.

50676,Conversations Anybody else feel like they dont have the natural ability to have good conversations?Whenever Im having a conversation with strangers Im often pretty quiet and I dont know what to say unless its work related or something Im really familiar with. I think this is normal with society anxiety thoughBut whenever I have conversations with a group of people Im comfortable with like my family I feel like I suck at having conversations. If its about a topic I dont care about I always zone out or stare at out the window. If its about a topic Im interested in its so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn I can wait but it stresses me out and its hard to jump in sometimes. It feels like Im going to forget what I was going to say or theyll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk I feel like people dont really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations sometimes its just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background. Anybody relate,Personality-disorder
50756,Becoming indifferent about relationships I havent been around anyone outside of my family in two weeks and Im really content with it. For the first time in a while I dont feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness because theres nothing to compare myself to. I dont have to worry about being asked about myself or being expected to be social. I like it this way. I dont know what this means though. Im dreading having to go back to class next week because everything I want to avoid comes back. Im tired of the pressure that my lack of social skills and low self esteem brings. No ones looking at me and judging. Im not constantly thinking I look awkward and shifting in my chair to look as normal as possible. I can breathefor once. No default answers to questions. No fake laughs. Just me. I know I cant stay in this shell foreverbut I like it here.,Personality-disorder
51107,I honestly feel like I'm undeserving of socialization unless I'm at my absolute bestperfect so I end up only even trying when I feel like I meet the criteria Have never been able to figure out if this is from my avpd or something else. It causes so much problems for me especially for romantic relationships where I feel completely unworthy of love or affection if I don't meet the criteria I have in my mindEverytime I go out and socialize without meeting the criteria in my mind I end up thinking that people probably feel disgusted by having me around,Personality-disorder
50984,I'm just very lost and exhausted so here's a little about my situation I struggle with extreme avpd I've been to therapy for 8 years with many different people. And I just feel like I'm sinking lower and lower as time goes by. It has gone too far and now I'm in a situation where I struggle to even open the front door or open my mouth to speak. I've lost the few friends I had years ago cause of the severe anxiety I felt and the panic attacks I had after meeting them. I live with my dad but I rarely talk to him cause even that is too hard for me. I studder opon my words and feel like I can't even have a regular conversation with my own parents without the severe stress I feel.I feel so hopeless and fragile. All I wanna do Is keep caging myself inside my room with my distractions. But I'm also incredibly unbearably lonely and ache for genuine human connection.

But it feels as if it all comes crashing down and a heavy sense of depression and grief hangs over me as soon as I'm reminded that other people do fun things together. I don't want to join them because most of the time having fun with friends isn't actually fun for me but the feeling persists and can go on for days. I know it's silly to feel resentful of these other people and it makes me resentful towards myself as well. I just want to make it stop. Ex driving my sister who is still in high school to hang out with her friends or go on dates.

50678,How to not hurt peoples feelings I think Im doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally dont interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I cant always have a recovery. When Im socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof disinterested monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them Im just worn out.Usually with strangers it doesnt matter that much because Ill never meet them again but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc. and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying but Im just really irritated right now for reasons other than you and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and theres no reason you wouldve known this Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I cant manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because I at least want to preserve their feelings. My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me do you hate me am I annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent its a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about.

I tested the water a few times n sort of let her know indirectly that i liked her and things still went well. I decided to just leave it at that and left on a good note I popped by on second day a few days later i was kind of nervous n had been kicking myself i didnt give her my number the first time knowing id have to work up the courage all over again . This time after we talked for about 10 mins i gave her my number i think i came across as lill more nervous the second time but I could of done worseShe never called. i thought there was some chance because things went well but i knew was no guarentee. She was quite alot younger than me but i didnt ask ages. . Still i was pretty hurt. Thats at least the last 5 times iv asked someone out or intended too n i got rejected in some way and them situations dont come around often and always require me to overcome so much anxiety . In all honesty im pretty bitter n sad sometimes at how hopeless my situation feels i cant change alot of things and people just overlook me without giving me much of chance because they see me as a loner or some other thing i cant really change.

A few months since I graduated high school Ive been working. But I cant seem to really talk to people. I have a tendency to avoid the groups sometimes I cant even open my mouth. Its even worse when I think about how much I suck and how awful I look. I feel like an inconvenience and a burden because plainly I am pretty stupid. Even though at the beginning of my job I was putting on a smile and a happy voice to convince myself it was okay I cant even get myself to smile or look people in the eyes unless I have to.

I've purposely passed up on big opportunities due to it and as a result held myself back multiple times.Well now I've stumbled upon a hurdle that I need to overcome in order to achieve my next goal in life. I've been looking for ways to bypass the hurdle so I don't have to potentially experience failure but I can't seem to find any other ways forward.

51018,Ive decided to opt out of this disorder lol Im not an extrovert I dont want attention Im okay with being silent I hate small talk I want deep connections that come from a place of mutual patience and empathy and Im sorry to admit this so late but I wont find that with like 99 of people. It just is how it is. What Ill try to work onIll allow myself to fail stutter or mumble when I dont feel comfortable talking in groups but Ill talk nonetheless when I have something to say so that I can practice that which Im not good at.Which means Ill allow myself to feel discomfort. Deep discomfort and shame which I know will lessen one day or Ill get used to the feelings. Ill allow myself to be intimate with people I feel comfortable with. And to warn them when I feel like fleeing and hiding. The right people will understand and wont give up so easily. Ill accept failure expect disappointment and revel in misery because I know it will lead me to something better than this dark void Ive been living in the last years of my life.

51388,Rant sorry. My heart just hurts. I feel very alone which I have a lot of my life subconsciously so its not usually an issue but the last 45 months especially have been intensely lonely.I go the gym try to eat good meditate etc. Some things help temporarily but most of the time Im in my own head. Its weird I get along with most people I come into contact with but also actively avoid a further friendship from any of them.The only pressure I feel to have friends is because its viewed as odd for a female to have no friends. my family members all have friends or people they hang out with..Me I isolate with my dog in my room 247 I even play games alone now couldnt handle having gaming friends anymore. the only person I talk to is my cousin.

When I tell her I want to make new connections with strangers she tells me that makes no sense and why don't I hang with family..She doesn't get it when I say family scares me more than strangers. With strangers there's much less at stake. They don't know shit about you you don't know shit about them and if something goes wrong you never have to speak to them again. It's one and done. She also didn't understand why I wanted to work retail I don't anymore for different reasons now. She asked me how can I talk to strangers yet I'm too scared to talk to family. She doesn't understand that I just do better in work or education based settings..You don't have to get into your personal life that much and once the day is over you go home and don't have to talk to them. There's not much expectations because they're your classmatescoworkers. You don't have to let them know too much about youMy mom just doesn't get it and I hate talking to her about anything at all because she gives me over simplistic solutions and lowkey makes me feel bad for having these issues when she's part of the reason why I have it in the first place.

50798,It's easy to say that everyone has worth. If I say that I am a worthless subhuman most people will react by saying something like everyone has intrinsic value and that you don't need society or other people to validate your existence. And while it may be theoretically true it's also easy and generic.What is difficult is to feel that you actually have value when such a big part of your life has passed without anyone seeing that value in you. I'm not a bad person but frankly I'm barely a person. I'm unable to do the majority of things most people do. I lack any semblance of personality. People forget about me and that's totally reasonable. Everyone likes me but not really. No one cares about me or is really interested in me.I have acquired major schizoid traits throughout the years to the point that sometimes I'm not sure if I need human connection anymore. But I find myself craving external validation. If there's no one there to believe that you matter do you really? The obvious answer is yes but I'm not so sure anymore.,Personality-disorder
50654,Does AvPD have another name in your language? In English there's both avoidant and anxious whereas in German there's ngstlichvermeidende anxiousavoidant and selbstunsichere self insecure. The latter got me wondering if there are other names for it across the world.,Personality-disorder
50614,I want to curl up into my bed and never leave This week has been absolute hell. I feel so overwhelmed with life right now and I want to be completely alone. I dont want to be perceived or asked why I missed two weeks of class. I dont want people constantly and very publicly asking me if Im okay. Yes Im fine but no Im not fine. Im fine enough to function but I also want to run away. I appreciate the sentiment I just wish it wasnt in front of the whole class.Im pretty sure most of this is my depression talking but its definitely making my AvPD symptoms worse. I feel like EVERYBODY is looking at me. Im beating myself up all the time for what I dontcant do. I feel like everyone hates me. I hate myself. I just want to hide. Curl up into my corner. Never speak to a soul.,Personality-disorder
51045,I wish it was socially acceptable to just ask am I important to you I know this question sounds resentful and judgmental. It sounds like an accusation almost. But I'm tired of getting hurt because I overestimate how important I am to the other person.Even if they said no you're not important to me It would hurt as hell but only at first like ripping the bandaid off. I would learn to not get attached and we'd talk at a respectable distance. Does someone know the way to word this question better? I'm so done with this constant confusion.,Personality-disorder
50648,I just need to vent about my partner. I think my partner has bpd maybe AvPDHi everyone. I have no idea how to start this. Im honestly not even sure if bpd or AvPD is correct Im just grasping at straws at this point. My 27f boyfriend 28ms brother has been diagnosed with bpd. Which is why this is my first step. And while Im obviously not looking for someone to diagnose him like this Im just lost. And need someone to listen. I am massively struggling in my relationship and I just need someone to listen. Even if this goes nowhere. My boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if I were to ask the same in return. We just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and I cant quite think of an example of that at the moment he does ask for things in one moment and when I do them or stick to it he tells me its wrong. Example he has wanted to get a photo ID for a while. We have two options drivers licence or a photo card. About a month or probably two ago he said he needed photo ID for a test at work hed been putting off. Then he said not long ago that we dont motivate each other to do the things we need to. I know he has anxiety planning things and doesnt want to so for our anniversary I said pick which ID you want Ill drive you there pay for it and itll be done. Ill put all the planning into it. All good and he loved that idea. The day we were supposed to go he was angry about something and it caused an argument. So we didnt go. Which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. To today. Each week he said Ill do it next week on my day off so I asked and he pushed it again. Today we spoke about it and while hes not good at planning I was waiting around to find out if we were going or not as I wanted to plan when I was done work and went to get gas and groceries. When it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test I told him that I didnt care if we went but if he wanted to study more now was the time. He told me tonight that he only did it so ID shut up about it and when I said you told me you wanted more motivation so I gave it to you he just said fair. But we always have those moments where he says he wants something and I change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. If I try and talk to him about my needs or what Im wanting more of or how Im hurt by something he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. Or hell just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what I was even talking about. If we have an argument for 1 full hour lets say. There will be lulls in the argument. Maybe every 15 minutes. Maybe start half hour mark and then end. It always changes but the lull is when he sits listens and answers me with respect. The other times its that I have said even one word to set him off and hes miserable. And angry and not nice. Im finding myself constantly working around his moods. Sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a TikTok or something I find interesting. If he agrees with what Im showing him all is good. If he doesnt he gets angry. Says hes confused and basically shuts down. Tells me he thinks thats dumb or why would someone even do that. Theyre not part of my life. Why do I even need to listen to that. If Im talking about my work or just complaining hell tell me why he doesnt want to hear it. That its not part of his world so it doesnt matter. Ive asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever I do hell tell me something he needs in return. He cant just take blame for things. Sometimes he can. But normally cant. I definitely do not help the situation because I am at his every beck and call and hes at none of mine. If he asks to be left alone and I walk to another room he says he feels guilty that Im going away. And that hell just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesnt get his way anyway. He wants to be left alone a lot. Cant ever take anything I say and listen. Always has to tell me why whatever Im going through is something hed love to have or how his life is worse. Example we moved for his work. Away from my family and friends and my best friend dropped me. While she was being shitty all the time she was the last person I had to talk to. And if Im sad about it he tells me thats his dream for people to leave him alone and he doesnt understand why Im upset. If something small happens he wildly blows it out of proportion. Especially if its something he doesnt understand. I have to be careful with how I joke with him because he will take everything to heart but has zero problem disrespecting me or poking fun at me for something. If we go out at all he doesnt want to be there and will usually get extremely high or drunk to avoid socializing because it makes him anxious. Im just not sure if this is like anything anyone has dealt with and Im looking for advice or help or just something. Thank you for reading this long novel. I really appreciate you all.,Personality-disorder
50684,don't be like me little rant I was a college freshman at the beginning of covid. I was just your stereotypical introverted quiet guy who also struggled in social situations. Covid gave me THE perfect excuse to avoid anything stressful. Don't have to go to class don't have to meet anybody everyday I just drowned myself in entertainment. Eventually I dropped out of class and basically became a shut in.Fast forward to a couple years later. I have no idea how time went by so fast. Everyone is all grown up and busy people keep asking about how I'm doing at school and everytime I lie to my parents that yeah I'm going to school I did good on my exams I'm about to graduate etc. It's so fucking unfair to my parents that I turned out to be such a piece of shit. I hate what I've become just lies and avoidance. When I'm actually motivated to do something I'm then immediately reminded by the reality that no matter what I do I still wasted all these years of my adulthood that I'm still betraying my parents' expectations that nothing I do is going to undo all the damage I did to myself. I'm a mess. I have no hobbies I can share with normal people I have no humor because I don't have any experience in the real world I can't make my family happy because I don't even like myself and it shows. Sorry for the rant sometimes you take a step back and really look at the situation you put yourself in and it's unbearable. Why didn't I try harder at school? Why didn't I tell my parents the truth? Facing all these fears I chose the easy way. And it is clearly the wrong choice otherwise I wouldn't be suffering this much now. If you're reading this I hope you can learn not to be like me. Avoidance is hell.,Personality-disorder
50985,Does anyone else do insane mental gymnastics to get out of going places? I swear some of the reasons I've come up with in order to avoid meeting people... it's so crazy like why can't this creative energy be harnessed anywhere else?For example I've literally riden a 30 minute bus to a place walked right up to the door then heard the dreadful sound of people inside.. and that's all it took for me to make a 180 and ride that same bus back home. The reason in my head was like hmm they're meeting next week so I can just wait until then surely I will do it next time D It's just Ahhhhhhhhh I hate myself man. Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why am I like thisand the thing is I really need the socialization too like I'm so freaking lonely... the instant I arrive back home I'm like shit I really should've just gone in now I have nothing to do again why did I listen to myself and it just makes me even more depressed thinking about how pathetic I am,Personality-disorder
51556,Quality over quantity Friendships I know people with AvPD struggle to maintain friendships and I do too. For me I think it's the daily or at least frequent messaging to stay in touch that I struggle with. I will get tired and ignore messages just because I don't have the capacity to engage with a subject that I frankly probably don't care much about or I'm just worn out by the constant interaction. The messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me. if it's a friend that lived far away then I'd rather not speak for 6 months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and fortunately I do have a couple that are like that. Anyone relate?,Personality-disorder
51540,crippling guilt from my inability to answer texts I dont know how common this is but its extremely difficult for me to find the strength in me to text people back and its killing my nonexistent social life and the possibility of ever finding love. I live in constant guiltdread knowing that I have people in my DMs trying to contact me to hang out but my fear of embarrassment and awkwardness is freaking killing me. All ive ever wanted was to belong and be able to make friends but my brain literally stops me in my tracks. Its also necessary to note that I have ADHD primarily inattentive and once I take my medication Im lucky to have maybe 30min of adequate dopamine levels to push myself and reply. Sometimes I do reply but when I go back to baseline I just want to isolate and be in my dark room. I really feel like Im being tortured by my own brain. Its a terrible feeling to crave social interaction but to also be deathly afraid of the possibility that I could ruin everything and be viewed as an embarrassment. I really dont feel worthy of having the opportunity to make friends. My SSRIs have made me so numb and my personality rarely sparkles anymore so I cant imagine anyone would want to be around someone so dull.Do any of you relate?? It feels like a mental trap.,Personality-disorder

51364,Professor made eye contact and I had to throw up Two weeks before my calc prof came to tell me how disappointed he was in me for my poor grades and lack of turning in assignments. It had way too much of an impact. I literally couldn't show up to the next two classes.I finally get back and he's doing standard lecture stuff talking while scanning the large crowd so people feel more engaged. His eyes grazed mine a second. I know it meant nothing logically. It's just how people talk to crowds sweeping eyes. But in that moment I decided his gaze was a glare a disapproving irritated message straight to me. I felt like a failure terrible. I left the classroom quietly. Soon as I reached the hallway I ran. I ran to the bathroom to throw up.Just a second of eye contact and it destroyed me. I hate being like this lmao.,Personality-disorder
50681,did a bunch of dxm yesterday and I realized that the reason I'm like this is that I've viewed other people as threats my whole life. Ever since I was little I've implicitly assumed that other people want to hurt me until and unless I have incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. I have no idea why I'm like this. It sounds like something someone who was abused would write but I wasn't. My parents were nice and caring. I just came out wrong somehow lmao. I had nothing to be afraid of and yet I was terrified of everything ,Personality-disorder
50726,I'm going back to therapy I'm 21 and I'm going back to college soon. I'm really afraid about the socialization part that comes with college. I think I have avoided getting help for so long but I reached a point of crisis because I have no idea of who I am and hurted a person very badly. Wish me luck! It really feels like a big step I want to say I'm proud of me for me doing this. I have been scared but I hope I can improve,Personality-disorder
51128,This is how I took care of my AVPD As someone who has highfunctioning anxiety and AVPD I really found it hard to develop relationships and take them to the next level. I never had problems talking to strangers and I was just able to easily go about my day unless I am met with familiar faces. I still study at a university and I've tried to invest more effort in socialising but to no surprise I wasn't making any progress despite exerting more of my resources for 6 months straight.I thought I was at a dead end. So I just gave up. I turned into this halfdead human who didn't give a fuck about anyone anymore. It felt good for a few weeks but all throughout those days I had this lingering feeling that whatever the hell I was doing was wrong. My rebellious phase eventually ended but I was still tired of trying to socialise.Ladies and gentlemen if I asked you what your next step here is what would it be?You see us AVPD folks are subconsciously feeling guilty and ashamed of ourselves because we assume and feel like we are not enough for the people we want to build relationships with. Take my advice andLet us be and feel human for a change. Everyone is imperfect so don't put up a face or please people because you are enough.Humbling myself was the first thing I did. As I was burntout from even trying to socialise I stayed put and just became me for a change I committed whenever I felt like it. There is no secret code no secret formula no secret anything to socialising you just experience the moment and live life at the present. Take good example from your childhood brain where times where simpler because we still had no idea of the norms and society's symbols. If you humble yourself and accept and approach every situation with humility and nonchalance you will find peace this is the power of kindness this is where the healing process of loving and respecting yourself begins.Going back to my story for the first time ever in 7 years I felt peace. Peace with everything. I don't want to forcefully strive myself to socialise with my peers because that is fake shit. Be of no responsibility. Do take note that I've seen big improvements in building relationships! Of course I was committing from time to time whenever I felt like it.So ladies and gents don't try to divert the river of life because the water will deliver you to where you need to go.Feel free to DM me if you want more about how I remedied my AVPD. Peace!,Personality-disorder
51178,Im just so dumb socially because Ive been isolating for so long Im 19 and havent had a friend in 4 years. Isolated myself from the world for eight months. So I fell so so hard for this guy just cuz he flirted with me. And now it seems so obvious he was just messing with me cuz he didnt answer like half of my texts till days later and never actually asked me anything about myself. But I made excuses because I thought I was being like clingy and not understanding how relationships work. But no if a guy likes you hes gonna show interest and actually answer your textsIts a little weird because Im paranoid so I assume everything means everyone hates me. But now that Im aware of this Im trying to stop it. But I went too far in the opposite direction now and ignored my good judgement because Im so inexperienced socially.,Personality-disorder

51523,How do you get through the process of getting a job? Im planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for. I shouldve started applying for those weeks ago but Ive been avoiding it because I feel like Id either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking Ill be a valuable addition to their institution which I dont think I would be. So essentially Ive been doing self sabotage. Now the problem is that Ive had quite a lot of absences at school the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. Ill need references for the application process I dont have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they dont want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they think they know Ill only mess things up. Honestly I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow would be a miracle in the first place Id somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again. If I dont go for this diploma Ill essentially have wasted four years of my life and I dont think my chronically depressed self could recover from that. Any advice?,Personality-disorder
50560,how to get over fear of therapygetting help i'm 18 and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but i'm so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as 'what if i misinterpret a question and answer wrong' or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful. i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist. i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it. i want help and i don't want things to get worse but i don't know how to go about it. any advice on how to overcome this fear or services available that i should start with?i'm from the uk btw,Personality-disorder
50917,snippets about me that maybe y'all can relate to This is an incomplete list of course but I've taken ages to build up the motivation to post SOMETHING here this is what I got for now. I'm hoping anyone reading this would please add to the conversation their own similar experiences or attributes or would please ask me to expand on any point I have listed.I need to consume multiple forms of media on multiple devices in order to be content. I divide my attention towards trivial topics. I have detailed dialogue in my head that I desperately wish I could record but whenever I try it's not detailed I get tired of it and it ends up unfinished. I have countless unfinished drafts and scattered files that I take endless time to organize only to still not post what I initially wanted to. I take hours to get myself ready to go out typically to my local dive bar. I know I'll enjoy myself when I get there and I know a lot of familiar friends and faces there. But once it's time to leave I psych myself out over going my primary concern is that I don't look as nice as I usually do or I'll get a detached disassociated feeling once I get there. Many nights I end up going to bed with my outfit and makeup freshly done and still on never have left my place. The red notification circle showing me the amount of unread text and unanswered calls I have is so large that it breaks me out to open the damn thing at all. I end up ghosting relationships that I didn't want to abandon. The guilt of how long it's been when they last sent a message to present day keeps me from responding. If I have to make plans with someone I have to actively not look at the other unread messages below it or else I'll have an internal panic. I'm selfisolated and alone and lonely more than I ever have to be and I fucking know this. I highly value people and relationships despite how my avoiding nature implies otherwise.My childhood consists of consistent moving for rarely to none disclosed reasons. My mom is an aggressive woman who's genuinely diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it's difficult to communicate with her. Growing up I never lived in a location even close to 2 years. I think this has fucked me up in many ways. I am a very vivid and active dreamer. I speak frequently in my sleep sometimes I wake myself up for my own talking. 4 years I had chronic nightmares and was a bedwetter the nightmares and accidents were most frequent after every move. This subsided by age 24 when I was done with University and moving as frequently. I've used meth for nearly 8 years via smoking and snorting never injections. It's never made me feel horny like it does most people. I compare the sensation to taking 'dirty Adderall' meaning I have a zombified obsessive focus on whatever task. I'm either indulging in rabbit holes or addictively playing chess on my phone. More broad and accurate to say is that I productively procrastinate my place will get so clean or I fulfill minuscule todo task but I continue to avoid my most pressing and urgent needs. Actual Adderall feels like medicine to me. Like the focus increase isn't jarring but natural. There's no crash and no tweaked out feeling. I feel like what I believe I'm supposed to feel like as a content and motivated individual.,Personality-disorder
50512,how to gently ghost an avoidant without making feel them guilty? so throwaway because im afraid she might be in this sub.before asking the real question long story short tldr at the endso me 22m and this girl 20f matched on tinder a year ago we want on a date and then she ghosted me the day after.tried to talk to her one day after few months got a single message reply and then she disappeared again.at the end of last year i notice she was on hinge saying she broke up with her bf so i started posting instagram stories that she mightve been find interesting and she started liking them so after a while i reached out to her and wishing a happy new year. she seemed kinda interest so we made plans for the following week.she ghosted me again. i was disappointed.after few days i noticed she had put me back in the close friends she removed me from it after the first ghosting so i thought mh she might be to ashamed to write me back after all this time ill reach out again and since then we never stopped talking anymore but here comes the problem.we just talked for a couple months i tried not to push anything to dont let her make uncomfortable and run away again but she basically is just venting on me and now she started venting also about male friends on and on so i got suspicious and i was right shes back on hinge with a fresh new verified and recently active profile. now here comes the problem and i dont mean her being on hinge at least not directly.shes in therapy and on meds im pretty sure her therapist wouldnt suggest her to be on hinge correct me if im wrong. she said she couldnt drink cause of meds and of med swings but few days ago she started hanging out at night she couldnt do it before hanging out with me couple weeks ago with a male friend and wanted to get drunk .she said shes to anxious to hang out with people outta blue .we were talking about hanging out again said she was super busy got even more busy with college lessons but she found the to hang out with somebody else while im being her emotional support for the last 23 months didnt text me back for couple days after hanging out with that guyso the real question is how do i gently end up things with her? i dont want to make feel her guilty but i cant keep stressing myself this muchi thought shed made progress with her therapist but apparently she isnt doing much of what they says so i think she might be helpless and toxic and mostly we arent on the same page i truly love her and i think she knows but shes playing with me and using me just to vent and for not feeling completely lonely TLDR after being ghosted multiple times with a girl with avpd adhd and probably bpd too im referring what she said to me we seemed to bond for once but she might be a toxic person and i dont think i dont want keep pursuing this anymore id like to slowly walk away without hurting both of us. she probably know im in love with her and shes playing me. even if id come out and wed make things work quite impossible imho im not sure she might be a good fit. sorry for language mistakes and for the format but im from mobile,Personality-disorder
50754,anyone else feel like isolationconstant lack of interaction is turning them into a hateful person? I mean i do have various have mental issues but i think chronic isolation in particular is a big part of why I'm growing into such a bitter and hateful person.Objectively it's not really much of a problem because i'm alone all the time so it's not like i'm being actively hateful or offensive towards others. But yeah basically it seems that whenever i hear sth concerning other people be it celebrities or strangers on the internet or whatever i am either jealous or upset. these are my only reactions i don't empathise anymore. it's kinda starting to affect my beliefs as well but I'm aware that it's more of an emotional issue than anything and I don't plan on being alive for much longer so no need to worry about that,Personality-disorder
50575,Does anyone find it so hard to get over a commentcriticism to the point they feel suicidal? Trigger warning. Mention of Eating disorders and suicide. A month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned 30. He was saying how he didnt look 30 and he pointed to me and said he looks older than me. Im 24. It felt like a stab in my heart. Ever since Ive barely left the house. I wasnt trying to date before that but now Im not even going to try. I feel suicidal now and I dont feel like lifes worth living. Im old looking for my age so I should just give up. That comment is running through my mind 247. Its torture. I feel so embarrassed. If my brother knew what that comment did to me it would suck. Im so angry but hurts. Its not really his fault how I feel but why did he say that. Ive struggled with eating disorders my whole life. I get anxious seeing my brother because Im scared of what he will say. Everything reminds me of that comment. I have barely been eating. It just reminded me why I shouldnt leave the house because other people will think the same. It feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but its taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday. How am I meant to go through life if a silly comment like that has gotten me like this. How do I get over it? Im not strong enough to go through life.,Personality-disorder

Then resentment around 6months used to be 3 yrs bc I dont exist and I can't seem to integrate anyone in my life.Its not fair to them. The start and stop has taken up so many years and energy. I wish I could feel so free w someone that I could just be in my underwear and sing every song I know seriously I would love to feel at ease with someone.

51574,Conversations Anybody else feel like they dont have the natural ability to have good conversations?Whenever Im having a conversation with strangers Im often pretty quiet and I dont know what to say unless its work related or something Im really familiar with. I think this is normal with society anxiety thoughBut whenever I have conversations with a group of people Im comfortable with like my family I feel like I suck at having conversations. If its about a topic I dont care about I always zone out or stare at out the window. If its about a topic Im interested in its so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn I can wait but it stresses me out and its hard to jump in sometimes. It feels like Im going to forget what I was going to say or theyll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk I feel like people dont really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations sometimes its just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background. Anybody relate,Personality-disorder
51425,I'm screwed maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.The average person is socially active whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.I'm incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career life experiences life skills energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,Personality-disorder

51567,I haven't been diagnosed yet I haven't been diagnosed with AvPD but I think I may have this disorder. I was always an anxious child then in my teens I started taking panic attacks before any social situation but mainly before going to school so I stopped going to school I just avoided it. I'm now nearly 30 and I've never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance. I feel like I now avoid anything that causes me the tiniest bit of stress by not leaving my house sleeping and not letting anyone know about it. I then get really depressed and disappointed in my self. It just feels like an endless cycle of me not showing and getting down about.

You people please and bend to their will even if you know it's fucking you over in the long run. I feel like being a fawn has caused me to hate people even more than I should lol. Because when people come around they usually come with some bs that I don't really want anything to do with. Wanting favors wanting me to be their emotional punching bag wanting validation wanting talk at me wanting me to give them stuff etc. I don't have a back bone and it's really hard for me to tell people to kick rocks without feeling guiltySo it just becomes another reason why I isolate myself. Nobody can drag me into their drama if nobody is there to begin with.Are you like this?,Personality-disorder
50939,Being avoidant and the pandemic I dont know what it was about the pandemic that hit me but it hit me hard and I still find myself stuck in so many ways. I was never so scared in my life.I became agoraphobic and couldnt leave my house. I became obsessed with the news and the statistics. For someone who has been suicidal practically my whole life I was truly afraid of dying.Did anyone else find yourself getting worse through this and what did you do to get past it? When I go to doctors appts they still make us wear masks and that scares me a bit still. Like what do they know that we dont?Im sure Im overthinking things like I do with everything else. My daughter is anti vaxx and it worries me too Ive had them all as a precaution since my health isnt the best now. I was working in retail at the time and watched the panic from everyone in the storesand now Im on disability because Ive gotten so bad about it. Its crazy.,Personality-disorder
51363,AvPD doesnt mean that your brain is ill right? I was thinking that AvPD isnt caused by some brain illness. It is very possible that most people with AvPD have healthy brain right?I feel like AvPD is just that we learned things incorrectly we were exposed to some very stressful situations as child and our brains learned that that situation this is bad.And now our functioning brain is reminding us with anxiety that this situation is familiar from past when we were learning things. And this anxiety is causing us to avoid these situations because we were learnt that they are bad.So from this point we can say that our brain is normally functioning? Brain is doing what it is supposed to be doing trying to stay out of danger and survive.,Personality-disorder

50720,I hate my crush for further reinforcing my insecurities I met him on vacation and we hung out for two days together at the swimming pool. I'm a very socially anxious person but with him I felt like I've known him for years. One night he told other teenagers that he liked me. They all told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriend's here. I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. Ever. All my life I was treated as a freak so I was just glad for this opportunity for something special. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and got really mad at our friends for telling me.He cut off all contact with with me after. I blocked him on Instagram after he rejected my Instagram request. I was so sad that the guy I liked decided it would be best if he never saw me again. The one person who saw me for all the good I have to offer and he still gave it up. They broke up two months later and he still looks at my social media. We're not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. I've never had the privilege of falling in love before and he just took it away from me. How could we truly ever be in love when he didn't want me? When he chose to let me fall into the abyss? I trusted him. I had confidence that he was a nice person and it was all a lie.,Personality-disorder

51428,Storytime... Hey so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there most of us are still there let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. Alright so I was showering thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!So basically I'm part of a church group and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't liketrust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. Though I don't share everything these people are genuine and kind and they always make me feel safe. It's just that I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me. So as part of going on the trip I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team 9 people including me. I trust love and feel safe with everyone on this team and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. Anyways the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small mostly funny slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles my past my family all of it. And these are my friends they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though the medicine is kind of iffy really. Anyways I'm super anxious about it especially since I did something similar last year but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year I was so empty and emotionless. But of course nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. But it's not like that that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy. I'm much better now but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay but as soon as I was behind closed doors I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though everyone of us is sharing our testimony no matter how much it hurts we're going to be here for each other.If you've actually read this far I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.,Personality-disorder

51198,Annoying habit of sighing I sigh a lot. It's just a habit I developed after years of fighting my broken brain. And it's annoying because when I am around people and do that it apparently gives them feeling like I am tired of them or even irritated while in fact I am just tired every single second of my life.It's not exactly avpd trait I think it's more about being mentally ill in general. It's especially troubling during my work. No actual meaning behind all that just vent about annoying shit in everyday life.,Personality-disorder

51485,Completely shut down when I know something uncomfortable is coming up I have a few university exams coming up that I'm not comfortable with taking and have no confidence of doing well in. I don't want to do them and the thought of preparing for them is absolutely exhausting partly because I feel like I have a lot to learn and even starting is hard. I just can't face it. So with that in mind I'm just avoiding my life and throwing myself into relentless scrolling on the likes of reddit and watching YouTube videos and basically becoming a robot. I'll probably cram in a load of information and ruin my sleep in the build up to the exam after wasting all this time.I don't know if it's a defence mechanism preparing for failure or what but it's fucking debilitating and I'm tired of it.,Personality-disorder

50891,Crying when seeing sth cuteinnocent? Whenever I see something cute andor innocent it literally hurts my heart. The classic pain in the heart that anyone who ever had depressionlovesickness knows about. Basically like a dagger stabbing you. Anyone feel the same? Examples Dad just bought a used Mac amp iPhone and he is so happy about it. Wtf would I want with a MaciPhone... But his happiness over such a simple thing hurts me. Mum finishing knitting one of her blanketssocks. Mum greeting the dog. WHATEVER makes mum happy makes me sad af because mum has depression too and idk how she can be happy. Why cant I be like her.... My GF just built a new computer its her first one she is very excited to do some vtubing on twitch or whereever. She's so happy about it... everytime I hear her being excited about it it hurts so hard. When Im alone it even makes me cry rare cuz im usually way over crying depression level wise. Also anything else she is happy about like a new plushie or whatever she cooked its always so innocent that it just hurts. inb4 ppl doubt my AvPD cuz i have GF I ghost her for about 4 out of 7 weekdays for no reason at all cant do anything against it... Yet she stays idk why.The dog greeting my parents. Animals in general.. My grandpa being happy about anything even tho he old.I just want their lifes I guess? I cannot be happy and I only think about negative stuff all fkin day. But im stuck in my own world my own body so I sleep more than 50 of the day. That way I only feel like shit 50 of the day. 5head move I know. Tldr Seeing innocence hurts my heart. Do you feel the same?,Personality-disorder
51503,I look like how I want to. So this is actually something really positive for me even if it isn't considered the best thing in everyone's minds. I was going to the bathroom and I was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days. The pants used to fit me just fine but I've lost so much weight that I have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off. Anyways what I'm getting at is I saw myself in the mirror when I walked in and I couldn't help but think that I look exactly how I want to look. I love how comfy clothes look my hair is long and messy and I guess I'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. I am embarrassed that as a guy I like feeling cute but I think it's great and I've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. But when I was admiring myself in the mirror I lifted up my hoodie no I don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies the temperature much too hot for that as I can barely wear this hoodie and I saw that my waist was super skinny. Of course I don't eat much and I still function fine so I guess that's okay. What I'm getting at is I was able to look at myself in the mirror today and I liked what I saw and people can think what they want I look exactly how I want to look today and I love that.Things have really been getting better for me and though there's still plenty of low points I can easily see my condition is getting better. I hope everyone else is doing okay and I hope that by sharing this I can bring some hope to anyone else who has been struggling with this pd.

51262,I did it I gave up my old life So yeah I did it. Or atleast I am doing it. I dont't know what will happen next. It was always a distant dream of mine to just leave everything behind. Maybe you can relate.I quit my job and my appartment. I left my cozy first world country with a one way ticket to India. Currently I am touring Rajestan on a motorcycle. The only contact to my old life is my family. Even though I would like to cut contact I can't bring myself to do it. It would break my mothers heart.I eat way too much seriously the food is amazing and get stared and begged at alot because i am a western guy. Some days I don't leave my hotel room. Other days I drive 300km on busy roads. You probably know this feeling. The ambivalence is killing me. I love being alone but at the same time I miss not being alone. And often I think doing this was a big mistake. The whole experience is.. meh.. And because I dont know where to go or what to do planning anything is impossible. Right now I have 50k in savings.

50981,How the hell am I supposed to deal with the ADHD AvPD combo? I am formally diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder tendencies. My therapist and general practitioner both believe that it's caused bycomorbid with inattentive ADHD but there is no formal diagnosis for that yet. I am taking adderall 15mg XR for it though and it is the only thing that has ever helped me.How the hell do I deal wit this hellish combination? I've deconstructed and deconstructed but the only point I can reach is that I understand why and when things are happening and that they're irrational but I can't change it.I have a handful of fixationshobbiespotential professions that I jump between and I never know if I can trust myself to know what I want. I feel like I'm at an urgent crossroads in deciding what to do with my life and I'm unable to stick to one idea. Is it ADHD distracting me with a new shiny thing? Is it AvPD ghosting my previous interest due to perceived failureinvalidation? Is it both working in tandem? I envy people who can dedicate hours a day to a single thing for upwards of a year. Video game speedrunners come to mind specifically. That's not something I am interested in but I am beyond jealous of the ability to sit and do one single thing for ludicrous amounts of time and perfect it.Anyone else experience this sick little combo?,Personality-disorder
51043,Coping Ok this is gonna be really weird and random but I just wanted to share this because..idk feels like something meaningful to me I guess? Thinking about all sorts of things takes like 99 of my day my brain never shuts. And when I think about big picture like the world outside my internal one and my struggles I am getting upset and resentful over my life. My one true friend during those times is my imagination and fantasies about life where I am normal and just..well happy. About a month ago I finished watching playthrough of Lost in Vivo and this is where the weird part starts lol. In short it's game where player comes through vivo exposure therapy to overcome their fears and anxiety. In the good ending player succeed and it represented as coming through light in the tunnel and reuniting with your dog. And that final scene it has such a calming music atmosphere. The player's been to hell and back so this light in the tunnel ending is really awesome. So when I finished it I started to imagine myself as that player. I've been through such a lot of things and I am trying my best to manage so it gives me that tiny spark of hope that after all universe will give me a break. Maybe things'll get better and maybe just maybe I could finally make baby steps towards my dreams without my avpd being triggered so much. Thanks for listening to me ,Personality-disorder
51442,Do you also feel this way? I just really came across with this term avoidant personality disorder on Google by searching why do I want to be alone and live on my own away from others and I clicked on the very first article that came up. I couldn't give much clearer description of myself after reading the article and so I looked it up on reddit and surprisingly a subreddit exists dedicated to this. I desire to be alone and living on my own away from my family and people because I feel inhibited by them. I feel like I'm restricted and couldn't act my true self when I'm with them maybe because I'm afraid of being disliked by them? I'm not really sure and I'm still learning and knowing about myself. Am I the only one who feels this way?,Personality-disorder

51509,I can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life I'm in my 40s now. The last time I had friends was in school. I'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. Actually I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. My friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends i.e. other outsiders. We'd meet to play computer games or sometimes rarely go swimming. But we never really talked about personal stuff. I'm not even sure this counts as friendship?Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together? Am I even capable of friendship?Consequently friendship isn't something I've been looking for.

50710,Is it okay to appear rude to others? I find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others.The funny thing is I am continually day after day in my attempts not to appear this way am this way. I don't give solid eye contact to others mere glances I hide myself away in plain sight with poor meek body language I carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions.All in vain attempts of appearing in my delusional mind 'nice'. It is so self destructive you essentially let people walk over you ignore you in some desire to be liked. By people who dislike you will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours or simply horrible people who you wouldn't want to like you. Let me give an example of what I'm thinking. You're shopping for groceries you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else you need something on that shelf like a tin of food or something. Usually I will see this and think 'oh my god don't want them to know I need something there' heavens forbid if they see me what will they think? So I quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move.So instead why not stand in their shadow and wait patiently let your presence be seen in an ideal world ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when you're more confident? So yes stand next to them and don't budge just let them know non verbally you're waiting.Another example you're at the cashier they're doing your items I always look everywhere but where I need to look I lose focus on what I should be looking at which is the items I'm paying for the cashiers eyes in case they're trying to communicate something. And what if they say something small talk for instance well maybe I'm not in the mood to pursue further small talk so why not just give closed answers why do I feel the need to fill the silences to say whatever I can to appear 'normal'. I come across as flustered shy unconfident I see it in their faces they see the fear they see the disgust on my face believing I'm a wrongin or something but it's really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face then they mirror it. And I think awful things about myself. So why not stay calmer speak slower not try and have a positive small talk experience just take things at my own pace. Otherwise I leave feeling utterly embarrassed ashamed and the next time I shop there and there my cashier they're going to hate that I'm there. As opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty.I'm rambling a bit losing focus on my words sorry but some of that probably doesn't make sense. I hope you get the type of rude I'm talking about. It's not purposefully being rude. It's more being true to yourself being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal. Something I avoid.Any ideas or experiences suggestions on these niche topic please?,Personality-disorder
51518,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know but in the platonic sense too.i don't even think i'm physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera.don't get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age i feel like it's too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people.but i think that's okay. somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food.there's some days when loneliness hurts though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.You think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont. In fact you feel more alone than you did before you left But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. Bojack Horseman,Personality-disorder
50993,Feel like I'm too far gone I'll try to keep this brief as I tend to ramble on about how much I pity myself. I just feel like no matter how much work I put in it will never be enough. I have been getting out of my comfort zone lately and putting myself into more social situations but the more I do it the more disillusioned I become. I think that even if the fear and anxiety I feel with socializing was removed I'd still only ever be able to interact on a superficial level. It's like a fundamental part of me is missing. It feels like the best I can ever hope for is to function in society at a basic level. Sorry to be a melodramatic downer. I'm just feeling really low today and wanted to put my thoughts out there. Maybe someone can relate. Thanks for listening.,Personality-disorder
51037,What should I do? Sorry for my bad English but I've been bottling up for too long and I don't know what to do no one can understand me even my parents and therapists and strangers on the internet.Last year 2022 in February I quit college online cuz I can't handle it even though I got a good grade in one of my courses but I didn't think I got it at all! And after that I wanted to start the business but I don't have money my mom gave me money but she just gave me 16 she said After the items sold out I will give u money again. But when I started to sell in my shop it didn't succeed cuz maybe I just have little items. Also when I was in college my mom rarely gave me money unless it was for college tuition and the money for internet. My father is still alive but he never paid for my school. But the hurt thing in my life was my stepbrothers think that my father never gave them money cuz they think that all of my father's money was used up for me. And now I am 22y.o. I sent many job applications about 20 or more but just get accepted for 1 job but I ignore it cuz I can't ride a motorcycle and I think the salary was too low. I was thinking that I want to go to another country for a job so I can get better life cuz I have a chronic illness and mental illness but I don't have money. I told my mom about that but she didn't agree with me she want me to just stay here. I rarely lied to my parents when I was asking for money but now sometimes I am lying to them cuz I think they are too stingy for just the only child in this family. I wanted to try short courses to get a remote job but I am unmotivated. People on the internet was saying that I have a sexy body when I sent my pics to them. I was thinking that maybe I can get a job in onlyfans but I was too shy about that. I've never doin' voice calling and video calling when I was doin' sexting. Btw I am still a virgin but sometimes I want to try to lose it but now there is no way to lose it cuz I have no life and my life is messed up.,Personality-disorder
51150,Phone calls are a fundamentally scary unknown way of interacting and it gives me anxiety on that basis talking to someone and only hearing a voice or getting phone calls from an unknown number is exciting and terrifying? like i already hate my voice mtf trans preop prevoiceTraining and interacting is a mess due to trauma and needing to be all these defaults that im not just to get along which isnt even true im just too afraid to be myself but i often lose that but whatever that's not the point people only want to interact in phone calls like hey there's letters theres email theres texting there are nicer ways to interact. but then again i just hate my face and voice which kinda makes both phone calls and real life really painful but at least im more used to real life despite the trauma,Personality-disorder

50700,I think I made a mistake So a couple of days ago I opened up about my anxiety and all the mental struggles I deal with to a friend. Now I feel like I over shared and feel guilty by doing so. I feel vulnerable whenever I am with him like I can't hide behind a mask. It feels so scary when you feel like they will also leave you eventually because they see the real you.,Personality-disorder
51514,Need to vent. I have had a partner for 4 years. Its a shock to me as well. But we havent had the greatest past. To make a very long story short When he started medical school 4 years ago when we first started dating he wasnt that nice to me. Some might say he was abusive towards me especially when he drank. Anyway he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.Now my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still havent let go of the past. And the truth is neither have I. Ive forgiven my partner but I havent forgotten how everyone else treated me even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school seek any professional or academic opportunities but mainly it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply dont trust anyone anymore. Today my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents and his friends were already there since theyre in the same class. Keep in mind that I havent seen anyone in about 23 years. After panicking for a week before the event I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself its not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot as well. Well.Aside from my partner everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke they wouldnt acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light so he didnt confront anyone. He did stick by my side so I was at least grateful for that. It all just augmented my social anxiety avoidant personality and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me. Im really struggling to decide if its just a bad day or if Im really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that hes grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes ideally we wouldve never had to go through our dark phase. But hes helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me. They have no idea what their rejection does to me.,Personality-disorder
50750,AvPD or something else? Sorry if this is actually completely normal or offtopic. Basically I find myself so genuinely hideous in a You look too ridiculous to seriously expect anyone to acknowledge you as a fellow human being kind of way. It doesn't just stop at my appearance either. It's literally every single facet of my being that is too ridiculous to ever be taken seriously. It prevents me from talking to people finding a well paying job making friends of any kind doing literally anything out of the ordinary including necessary appointments like the doctor or even wanting to be alive. The only person I see regularly now outside of work is my therapist who insists there isn't anything wrong with me as a person but I find it incredibly hard to believe he doesn't see just how unbelievably embarrassing and stupid I am. This feeling causes me constant distress and is completely unshakeable even though I am aware of how logically silly it is and I worry it might mean I have a personality disorder because it handicaps every part of my life. Obviously no one on here can diagnose me but I guess I am wondering if it sounds similar to what you guys deal with.,Personality-disorder
50853,Do people get upset at you because you used to talk to them a lot then you stop talking to them? I talk to a lot of people sometimes then I get really exhausted and cant keep up. Then I dont want to talk to many people anymore. The people I end up not talking to anymore some get really upset at me for not talking to me anymore but they dont tell me so how am I supposed to know?,Personality-disorder
51227,Communication When you have avpd you avoid forming relationships ight?Therefore most of us prefer living like hermits. The point I am trying to make is is there anyone else who notice that they can't carry even simplest chit chats?When someone tries to talk to me and asks anything I try my best to come up with an answer but it feels like there is some sort of static in my head the white noise. I guess it's because I heavily prefer my fantasies over real life ,Personality-disorder
50856,I am really truly screwed this time My parents have decided to stop paying for my food in the middle of a catatonic depression. Im scared for myself. I woke up today finally having had enough with starving. I was on my way to the store for the first time in a month Ive only been running low about a week tho when I got this text from my dad Do not spend any money at all this week. Rent is coming out and there is ONLY enough in there for the payment. Unfortunately you have gone through the remainder of the borrowed money from the loans I took out. And you didnt get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late. You will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account.Im backed so far into a corner. I am just defeated. I have no food left I have no money and I cant bear the judgement. It feels like Ive already lost everything now theyve even taken my food? I cant do anything about it in this mental state. They dont even know Ive already failed out of my semester and cant leave my apartment. And my parents are insane. Legitimately delusional and abusive human beings. I mean Im crazy but these folks? Who starves their mentally ill son because theres not enough money and then flies to Vegas for the weekend for a vacation? I hate myself but even I dont deserve this. The isolation judgement and control I live under is unimaginable. Theres nothing metaphorical about it it is torture.Edit Im doing alright got some help from a friend for this week.

Why do you talk like that? Why do you laugh like that?. Or imitating how I walk talk or move to be funny. I don't get how it's funnyIt makes me insecure about every little thing I do. I noticed how they don't do this to other people that often it's mostly me.

50509,An absence of social pleasure social anhedonia It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone elses body but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. It is rare that I enjoy a persons company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people I cant deny this but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. To say it different I dont feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default being alone is peaceful and ideal. Is it really anhedonia or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I cant feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others. Wish I understood so that I could participate more in life.,Personality-disorder
50814,Is getting diagnosed with AvPD worth it? So correct me if Im wrong about any of what Im about to say. I noticed that the treatment for AvPD is cbt which would be pretty much the standard treatment for a lot of mental health problems. So is it worth going through the process of being diagnosed with AvPD when you could just be diagnosed with something like say anxiety and still get the same treatment options? Again if Im wrong dont hesitate to correct me. Thanks and have a great day.,Personality-disorder
51033,My father My father is an addict and overall an incomprehensible and insufferable person. He never gave me nothing. He has never been willing to listen to me and when I insist on expressing my ideas he calls me punk alienated or callow. He never gave me a useful advice. He's extremely obsessive and unflexible. His neuroticism hits the skies. He talks with imaginary people. He's unable to follow the most basic social conventions to the point of harrasment in very grotesque ways. He believes that most people including me my mom and my brother are zombies dominated by the virtual world and the hegemonic imperial power that displays an upside down world sic.We live in Venezuela. He believes or used to believe that he was secretely the number two of the regime that Maduro qouted his tweets and that the Intelligence Service escorted him 247. He believes that his neighbour who has been repeatedly harrased by him owns the biggest child prostitution ring in the country.Despite coming from a consolidated upper class white family and having opportunities in places like San Diego he never worked. He never provided. My mom who comes from a family of peasants has provided everything in my life by nothing but her own hands. When my grandmother died due to my father's negligence he inherited a ridiculous ammount of money by selling our house. He wasted it all in obvious scams in exchange for literal bottles of rum and whiskey. At one point I felt anxious about the prospect of him not providing a HOME for me and him.He has always been a parasite. When he could he consumed alcohol in copious ammounts and acted very aggresively and disturbingly. He made me cry sometimes. He brought my mom to the brink of madness. His surroundings always smell like tobacco and piss. Now he totally depends on my mom for survival. He's a eternal thing in my life.,Personality-disorder
51560,what avoidance feels like to me i'm not diagnosed but i always thought there was something deeply wrong with me. i've never kept a friend longer than a couple years. i'm in my second year of college and i have been at zero since covid happened. i've transferred schools so new place and new people and i'm more isolated than before.it feels like i'm not human because i'm unable to do the human thing and communicate. like i'm watching and observing but as an alien or a void or something that looks human but if you look to closely its all distorted. or robotic even. someone's failed attempt at a human being.all i do is lay in bed and ruminate over every bad interaction with past friends and family or think about how my roommates or classmates perceive me. fake conversations justifying my actions to absolutely no one. it feels like i'm going insane. i thought it was just social anxiety but i don't get panic attacks. and my reluctance and inability feels wired directly into my veins every fiber of my being and it feels like it can't be undone. like my entire identity is wrapped up in being alone. and that's all i'll ever be.,Personality-disorder

51489,Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD I don't date much and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. Hes a empathetic person that cares for other people but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95 sure he's gone to therapy because even though he will explode at the most random times there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.Before we dated I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly a few weeks before he was flirting with me but I didnt pick up on it. So when I invited him it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter that I dont follow he was saying stuff like playing with peoples feelings is bad and disloyal people annoy me. The next several weeks he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.Hell also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really arent a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll.

I don't mind strangers seeing me too much I mainly struggle with seeing someone regularly. I got few thousands saved since I never used to spend money on anything. I'm not thinking about travelling rather renting something in nature and staying in one place for a month or two.

50983,Getting used to loneliness I feel like before I really longed to be part of the group. I longed to have someone who would choose me over the others. I longed to be someone just like anyone else. But somehow nowadays I don't really want that anymore. I'm just so used to being alone in the group alone at work and anywhere else that I just prefer to be alone. It feels like a burden to be a part of something. I prefer to do my thing in the group like at work but I don't want to get mentally attached to anyone. I don't know if it's a survival mechanism to protect my own mental health or if it's just because I'm tired of trying to belong to somewhere. Maybe I have just accepted who I am and what will never be. Does anyone else feel the same? I don't mean this to be a negative post as I don't feel sad about this. I'm just stating how things are and I've somehow made peace with it. Maybe in the future it can make me feel sad but not atm anyways.,Personality-disorder

Its even worse if I liked them when I first met them. There are specific shifts I want more of because I like the work better but in those situations I feel bad for whoever has to work around my quiet self. And When I speak I sound confident but I cant have conversations per se. People thought I was normal for maybe a few weeks and then gave up. Im not being mistreated but its lonely.

I don't even have the motivation to try to do it anymore. But it makes me sad when even other socially malfunctioning people thrive in niche communities and I can't.

I couldve had a fuller social life in school but I was so in my shell I just had a few close friends. And even with them I felt I couldve been better. It seemed like they all clicked with each other very well and even though we were all good friends sometimes there was something missing in my connection with people. I know they say skills are to be learned but it really really REALLY seems like its just inborn for other people.

She was older than me and even though when she as saying these things to me I always tried to fight back and say something similar to her it didnt really work. She was older and more mature than me so hearing it from her kind of made me believe that I really unworthy human who dont deserve or achieve anything in life. She was calling me names since I was a small child I dont even remember times when she wasnt calling me this.I dont think that anyone would be able to gaslight me easily but hearing it from older sister who I loved was painful for me. I dont even know if I believed these things it just made me feel bad that my sister hates me for no reason or for idk what reason. And that made me think that if my own sister hates me than every hates me probably which leads to low selfesteem I guess.She had control over me when we still lived under the same roof.

Although I was nervous the trip has been going well. Until last night.I was in the bathroom with a couple girls at this bar talking to a girl and just making conversation. At one point she just told me to go away. I repeated what I said because I thought I had misheard her. Then she told me to go away again. Me being dpdavpd I dont handle confrontation well. So I just walked away.I told another girl there who I trusted and she helped me feel better. But these situations are why I struggle with going outmeeting new people. At any moment they can just say one thing that completely ruins my whole night. And the next day. And the next few days after that.I know shes probably just insecure and projecting that on to me.

Could be when my mental health went downhill or when I got off my meds or when I got high almost every day for a year. But nowadays its not uncommon for me to struggle to write simple sentences. Sending an email or text takes me way longer than it should.It really interferes when Im trying to talk with others.

51109,Rising anxiety I don't know why I'm writing this Im just feel so anxious rn. I'm worrying about everything. I don't think any of this ends well for me. It's not getting better it's just getting worse everyday. During the day I'm ok but at night when I'm alone and have no distractions I feel scared and anxious. I realize I'm alone and I'll most likely always be alone. I can't be around people when I'm like this I self isolate even harder when I'm hurting. There's a really bad feeling in my stomach rn I feel so strange. I think there's something wrong with me. I'm not good enough in anything. I'm legitimately the worst human being to exist. Why tf am I still here none of this ends well. I'm just so tired n even when I sleep I wake up tired. I wanna escape this but I don't know how. I can't do this. I'm not worthy of existing. Fuckin hell I think about dying most days but I don't want to. I really wanna live a happy life with people in it. But there's so much I can't control. My brain is always trying to fuck me over. It's life on impossible mode. Srry for the rant I just don't know where else to dump all this.,Personality-disorder
50888,It's getting harder to pretend I'll be okay My birthday was last month. I turned 26. I went to a buffet with my mom because she was the only one who remembered. It was nice but the whole time I also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life that this is going to be my life forever. And a month out the dread is still here. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about how I'm closer to 30 now than to 20 over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric and I have nothing at all to show for it. I still haven't met basic milestones others do in their teens. And I don't see myself meeting them anytime soon. I never learned how to drive. I've never lived on my own. I've never held a job for longer than a year. I've never had a friend let alone a romantic attachment. Most of my hometown is a mystery to me because I've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. And at this point the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own.Sorry for the melodrama. Point being I'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time. And I can't talk to anyone about it because I don't know anyone except my mom and she really doesn't understand why I can't just force it. To be fair I don't understand either. Thanks for reading and have a good day.,Personality-disorder

51576,How to not hurt peoples feelings I think Im doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally dont interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I cant always have a recovery. When Im socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof disinterested monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them Im just worn out.Usually with strangers it doesnt matter that much because Ill never meet them again but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc. and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying but Im just really irritated right now for reasons other than you and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and theres no reason you wouldve known this Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I cant manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because I at least want to preserve their feelings. My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me do you hate me am I annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent its a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about. I cant handle navigating those questions when Im socially overstimulated but I dont want to make her insecure worse either. I know a relationship is a two way street but I always feel like a burden for my emotions and needs Any advice?,Personality-disorder
51520,AvPD and covid has ruined my dream job. So I've been a nanny for about 10 years now daycare before that and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction. I'd go to work one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say goodnight and that was it. Since covid however at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to say hi to their kid. I worry so much about where they are what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby my appearance the way I dress. I imagine they're mocking the way I sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.I am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder. I can't tell you how many times I've tossed my phone across the room when I hear footsteps coming because even if I am only looking up the weather or craft ideas I'm terrified they'll think I'm on the phone all day.,Personality-disorder

50508,Expressing myself I feel like Ive had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. Its that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort. I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the fake it til you make it strategy. Although I became more conventionally likable it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But Im trying something different.Its very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling say it put it out there in some way for better or worse. Also treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.As I said its challenging and not always doable this is because A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.But regardless I realize that this is what I have to do and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing whats on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment rejection etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said but whether or not that is true isnt important.Ive been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music writing and drawing and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.Anyway Im tired of pretending. Im not sure if I will ever be able to speak without fear and shame but at least I wont have to strain myself into a safe caricature. Maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but I hope someone relates or understands.,Personality-disorder
50987,I feel out of place no matter how much I try I recently signed up for uni and the first two weeks have been okay if only I'm only slightly disappointed for not doing more to talk to other people and befriend them.I still managed to befriend two or three people. I try my best to talk to them but even just greeting them makes me feel anxious because what if they didn't want to greet me or they didn't want to talk to me or they're talking with someone else clearly closer to them than me or at least more interesting. So I end up feeling out of place because I can't gather the courage to talk more while they all befriend each other.Despite all of these feelings I kept pushing through and this last weekend I managed to ask one of my classmates friends who I considered myself to be the closest to to hang out and they accepted. It went well we talked a lot and in the moment it felt like we were having fun. But when I came back home all of these awful feelings that maybe they were uncomfortable and didn't really want to hang out with me or talk to me and they were just being polite and nice or maybe they were just trying to see how it would be like to hangout with me realizing I'm more of a nuisance and a bore than it's worth to keep around started consuming my mind.I tried to push these thoughts in the back of my mind as much as I could but today I already went to class with all of these thoughts filling my mind. I saw my friend ? enter class but I couldn't bring myself to talk to them. Not even a single greeting nothing and I felt like a piece of shit for not trying more because surely they thought I was rude for not saying anything. They were talking normally to other people during break time and I envied all of them. I wish I could talk so easily with other people befriending them. I wish I wouldn't be scared of saying anything in fears of being ignored. So I ended up feeling out of place again despite my desires to fit in.I thought maybe at least we'd have the chance to talk after class. No. All I could manage to mutter was a halfcut word before they said goodbye even if smiling and walked up to someone else to talk to them. My logic says everything is okay and today they were simply on a rush after class but my AvPD says they absolutely hate me and don't want to do anything with me anymore.I feel like I messed up big time and that I lost a potential friend. I feel like I lost all my chances of having friends ever again even. And I know it's my fault because I should have talked more but when I talk more I'm scared to scare them all away. I hate how hard it is to simply say 'hello' and ask someone how they're doing. I feel like I'll be seen as a weirdo and ignored even if the person is a friend.So I don't know what to do.Sorry for the long rant. Sorry if I used the wrong flair too I don't normally post anywhere. I just really needed to vent.,Personality-disorder

I dont have any kind of social life and can easily spend several weeks without seeing or speaking to anyone. I do have family but they all live far away and I dont see them often.So sometimes I cant help but wonder what would happen if I ever have a stroke or a heart attack or if I fall down the stairs or if I choke on some food I often read about people being found dead in their home several years or even decades after they died and deep down Im convinced thats how Ill end up.

Im the only single person here and theres so many years of bonding and inside jokes Ive missed out on. You know when at the beginning of the night everyone seems happy to see you and laughs at your comments if youre your lucky but then everyone slowly stops replying to you and distancing themselves from you as the night goes on. I also got overstimulated and frustrated very briefly not at anyone in particular but now I just feel like I overstayer my welcome.

I feel like shrinking and making everyone forget I was ever here.,Personality-disorder

I have a few close friends in particular who say it a lot to me and to one another and I just can't say it back for some reason. And it's not that I don't care about my friends it's just some mental block in my head I guess. Saying it to parents or siblings feels more automatic in a way I guess and is therefore less uncomfortable. Such as ending a phone call with love you bye love you too bye.

Well I couldn't stand it in middle school it's been 10 years since but I'm starting to have the words for it.The 3 things that I wish I could just snap my fingers and get rid of.Jealousy I am jealous of many people. Impersonally. I'm jealous of people who do things that make them cute who do things that everyone enjoys and wish they could do for money I'm jealous of people who speak naturally without any sort of impediment especially those who entertain for a living I'm jealous of people who are pretty.Hatred Goes hand in hand with jealousy a lot of the time. I also hate pretty much everyone I'm jealous of and I want to wipe them out. I want to take everything they have. No not just a single one but all of them. Because all that's theirs is mine. I want everyone who doesn't fall to my wrath to be scared of me. To pray for my mercy. To spend every waking hour thanking me for letting them live.

Like I dont really care if they think Im dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying. Eye contact is the absolute worst because its 100 percent focus. I always try to look people in the eyes but HAVE to look away within a second otherwise I feel like theyll hate me. Im 24M and its waaaay worse with women I feel like Im invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point I dont even know what their face looks like after an interaction.When my best friend of 10 years comes over to watch a movie I will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch. But I can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all. I also feel like I have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if I go to a restaurant I will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time.

Dogshit family 12 years of bullying and this is what's left. Legit what the fuck lmao? And you know what's funny? I realized this couple of months ago. I legit had NO IDEA that I had it insanely bad up until now. Drunk friend got on top of me we made out she started undressing and I legit just stared at her BLANK. Had no idea what to do why she would do that and what to think. That's when it hit me. I'm an absolute social failure. I can never initiate anything I never talk about emotions and now I truly understand the only way I'll ever have sex is by getting raped. That's it. I CAN'T EVEN RETURN A FUCKING HUG! I don't want to be like this. I'm fucking 25 already. I legit didn't care about any of that until I realized how nice a kiss felt. I can only imagine what sex feels like. I fucking hate my life.

50665,How to cope with shame Hello I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame shame of what I did in a specific moment shame of how I reacted what I've said shame on how I was dressed the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things because anything material has more value than me . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things. ampx200BHow do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life? When I remember one time I start remembering the others they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence that they already happened that there is no way I could live with those things that happened.

51015,i dont know why i dont like having relationships with people ive always felt extremely anxious around people and unfortunately due to covidquarantine ive gotten really used to and fond of being alone. ive have friends but im horrible to them i feel extremely guilty about it but i just dont know what to do. i constantly avoid going places with them by coming up with really elaborate excuses i dont let them know anything about me or my personal life either. but theyve always for some reason have come to me for advice and to vent i dont necessarily dislike when they do that but im not opening up to them about myself and i think im hurting them in the process. the idea of me having friends or even a romantic relationship sounds really nice in theory but the moment anyone shows any sort of initiative to become my friend i immediately become exhausted or even sometimes annoyed. i feel like such a deeply horrible person because of my cowardliness since i dont ever express this to anyone. i just dont know what to do i want to be alone but i also want someone to care for me and i care for them but i realistically just dont see that happening to me maybe i dont deserve it i really dont know. this all sounds really convoluted but if anyone relates or has any advice please let me know.,Personality-disorder

51468,Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I selfdiagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic paranoid insecure and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my trauma is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did but they felt really sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself and nobody did for me.This person lashed out at me calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and honestly that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.This person wasn't wrong but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back it felt nasty and unwarranted.Still though it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends a few years since those bad exchanges occured and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my selfesteem and it still does.When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like I wanna die to myself like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more normal again though.Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered offtopic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.,Personality-disorder
50541,How common is this for people with AvPD? Sorry I'll try to keep it relatively short.I'm a 31yearold male and I've never been diagnosed with AvPD but while reading about the symptoms a month ago things finally made sense to me why I act a certain way. I thought I just had some kind of social anxiety when I went to therapy several years ago but I've felt that there has to be something else since I started feeling different in middle school. I've avoided people responsibilites and have taken jobs where I can mostly avoid interpersonal communication. I do still have close friends a great family and a girlfriend but I still have this urge to selfisolate and be alone. However I do try to help people whenever asked and I try to do well at my workplace. Right now I have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion 13 years along the line in a position that I could basically hold for the rest of my working life. But it would surely involve a lot more responsibilites speaking another language I don't know too well I live in a bilingual country where I speak the minority language a lot more and of course a ton more interpersonal communication. I've searched and applied for other jobs recently because my current contract will expire in a few months. I'm much more inclined to take a temp job for 1 and a half year with something I like more and less interpersonal communication than a potential permanent job position. It probably sounds crazy for most people if they heard this but this is genuinely how I feel. I let my feelings of inadequacy and wanting to avoid people control me instead of doing something that could secure my future. Is this at all relatable?,Personality-disorder

Not because they are doing something suspicious but because they don't want their preferences or choices to be seen? I have the option to watch YouTube on a smart TV but instead I watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when I'm in company because I don't want anyone to see my web or streaming history even if it's something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article. I just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although it's generally harmless and boring crap.I remember being 10 years old and my brother being angry at me because I would turn off the TV and act all shifty when he walked into the room.When I was a child I would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because I would be so embarrassed.

The other night I told myself that I'm nothing more than potential. The reason I'm lonely is because no one wants to wait around for me to finally decide to be a reality. Im walkingempty promises. That encompasses a lot. So when someone wants to tell me about myself it feels like a rerun. And they hate that. Hate that they can't get their issue off or add their redundant nugget of truth. Idk if that's part of avpd. And its coming off as arrogant. It's not the critiscm itself. I don't mind. More fuel for the fire. It's the attitude that erupts in response to me being unphased. I always feel like I'm preparing myself for the worst possible things so I'm not as affected when they happen. Being one step ahead of anyone trying to hurt me. Sorry if this has been discussed. I'm in and out a lot.,Personality-disorder
50708,My dog is teaching me just how destructive my mum was for me growing up and now. The other day my mum left the house and my dog had zoomies. I thought how strange. Maybe she is glad she has me all to herself.Then I became aware that all the tension went out the door with her.I've been so isolated with only my mum as 'company' that I forgot how different kind and cool other people can be. I'd become a bit of a misanthrope. However on walks I've met some really genuine and good people. It was shocking. I couldn't believe it. It's making me realise how harmful being in constant contact with my mother who is extremely toxic is for my affiliation with humans.I can't wait to move away from her. Maybe I'm not doomed to be alone.,Personality-disorder
50873,What is AvPD like? I had social anxiety or still have some of it. I also was diagnosed with AvPD by one therapist but I am not sure if that one fits. I tick a few boxes and every personality style test says I am anxious avoidant but I don't really know what that would mean.So what it something that makes someone AvPD in your experience?,Personality-disorder
51123,Having no romantic relationships or prospects for one is eating away at me I am 24M and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind not even crushes. I lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff. I've never even had female friends except some cousins.I live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. I'm nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious especially for women. But I don't see myself ever getting married. I'll probably KMS before 30.It feels like I will miss out on this part of the human experience because I'm so insecure around women. I saw a post that summarised how I feel perfectlygtI have trouble talking to women in fact I can't even make eye contact with them especially if I find them even a little attractive. I'm scared they'll think I like them and then they'll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them.I know that going into a relationship won't fix me but it's so gut wrenching knowing that you don't have the skills or prospects that can make it possible. It's stopping me from even trying to make friends with women IF they think I like them they'll probably be disgusted by me. Even though I'm scared to even let myself think that I might like someoneI know that I should try to make friends with women first but I'm afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women let alone having female friends or a relationship. It's like I carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and I automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it.Is there anyone out here who knows what this is like?,Personality-disorder
51191,Just got home from a party All I did was stand awkwardly by myself in the middle of the room the whole time. Despite drinking and smoking some weed I felt too aware of myself and any potential eyes on me. Im always so utterly restricted I never let myself have any fun never dance never play any drinking games participate in karaoke etc. because I dont want to people to judge how badly I am doing Im scared they would want nothing to do with me if they see how bad at I am at everything. Im literally terrified of any selfexpression and I wish just once I could be normal and let loose and just have fun,Personality-disorder

Am I going to get my dream job? Have a fun life? Travel around the world? Apparently not. Apparently I'm just a guy who will stay in his room for the rest of his life and be perpetually awkward at social gatherings. I'm 22 and I feel like I'm 60,Personality-disorder
50847,I told my therapist about my assumption of AvPD He told me he doesn't think I have it only SAD. Above all the constellation in my parental home would not favor this. I think that many of my AvPDlike symptoms are probably due to my depression.Anyway thanks for all your advice it really helped me a lot ,Personality-disorder
50601,Im mostly so avoidant due to being ashamed of my appearance and feeling like I dont belong. Anyone else feel the same way? Im a below average looking guy and I just want to be normal looking. I feel like my AVPD has gotten worse over time because I am just too ugly for life.,Personality-disorder
51420,I think I have AvPD avoidant personality disorder I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off Im very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping. I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. Im not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level. I dont really open myself up to anyone. Im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. Im close enough with my parents that I dont get anxious around them however I still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. I have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. Whenever Im at work I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience I overthink everything and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like Im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when Im asked questions and I dont feel like Im much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by. I play it safe. Ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like its more than just that.,Personality-disorder
50935,i found that I'm incredibly negative an judgy I'm not sure if this is exactly a surprise when having AvPD but I found that I often judge people in my mind about the smallest things and those are all the things. I'm hyperaware of and don't let me express freely as a person.Not only people but also places scenarios comments. My mind is stopping me of being able to enjoy simple things in life and I don't want it anymore.College is starting soon and I'm more mature and I want to fit in. I don't think I'll be able to enjoy any potential friendships I can make if I don't change how I think,Personality-disorder
50586,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned in a western country and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling... Just want to put this out there and wondering if others are the same way.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wl0eu,Personality-disorder
51382,AvPD and Psychedelics Does anyone have any experience with psychedelics? I've personally never done them but I feel like they could possibly be useful in treating noncurable disorders like AvPD in a guided session with a certified therapist. I've read about the dissolution of ego people some times experience during psychedelic trips and it seems like that would be helpful for AvPD.,Personality-disorder
51455,I suspect myself of having AvPD I am turning 17 in a month and a half and I suspect myself of having AvPD I am trying to do more research on the disorder I am not going to self diagnose but I am hoping people who are diagnosed can tell me more about the traits and what its like having AvPD.,Personality-disorder
51406,An absence of social pleasure social anhedonia It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone elses body but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. It is rare that I enjoy a persons company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people I cant deny this but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. To say it different I dont feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default being alone is peaceful and ideal. Is it really anhedonia or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I cant feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others. Wish I understood so that I could participate more in life.,Personality-disorder
50530,Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. Even then the relationships I do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.,Personality-disorder
50838,feeling better then worse again i know recovery is never an uphill slope but it still feels like shit when you take steps back. after getting little to no socialization for the past decade ive been really pushing myself to get out there more. ive joined a peer support organization for people with mental illness and ive been going multiple times a week. some days i feel like im making progress by challenging myself to engage in conversation and when it goes well it feels nice. but thats not every time... sometimes like today i feel like i dont belong and shouldnt be there. there were so many people today i just felt invisible and like i didnt matter so there was no point to even trying to make conversation. maybe it was too overwhelming or i had nothing to add to any coversations and yet i still feel like im back at square one. logically i know im not because im still going to keep trying but it just hurts to feel this way. to always feel like youre invisible and shouldnt exist. i dont want to feel like this. i want to have friends so badly its painful to be this lonely. i want to belong. and yet... i still believe i wont. im not giving up. it just sucks personality disorders suck!,Personality-disorder

50780,does anxiety play a part in your avpd? i have anxiety disorders one being social anxiety so i experience a lot of anxiety with my avpd. when it comes to social situations my anxiety is so high that im sweating heart is pounding and it feels like my brain shuts down completely. it causes me to fail so badly at socializing even more than i already would it doesnt give me time to hear what people are saying or to give myself the time to think of a response. its embarrassing how i react internally cause it causes me to react externally in a way i wouldnt want to. id like my brain to be calm and relaxed so that i can properly think of my reactions and responses but nope i end up looking like a fool which leads to more self hate and feelings of ineptness. does anyone have experiences like this?,Personality-disorder

51254,Invisibility!! I think today's the first day I truly felt invisible and I'm honestly glad. It was my first inperson class in a while and required discussion participation for a grade. But all I had to say was one sentence and then I could happily mind my own business. It's incredibly relieving to just do your own thing not wonder about what others think of you and not be expected to be a vital member of the class. That's why it's so important to learn about yourself to be comfortable in your own skin to the point where you feel that you don't have to justify being yourself.,Personality-disorder

51076,Old Friendships Past Due Date? I'm pretty much completely alone. My family is mostly dead and the rest no contact. I'm f42 divorced no kids and I just ended a three year post marriage relationship that was pretty toxic. I have two best friends since High School. We've known each other over 25 years and we used to be inseparable. We all had family issues so we became our own family. They both moved out of state at least 15 years ago so the majority of our friendship is on the phone and we maybe visit each other once or twice a year. My last relationship which lasted three years really got in the way of our friendships. My boyfriend was so clingy I could never call my friends because he wouldn't leave me alone for a minute. That's a whole other unhealthy issue I can't get into. Lol. But as an avoidant person it drove me crazy. Anytime I had the chance to be alone without my boyfriend the last thing I wanted to do was call my friends. I needed alone time. I did try to break up with him several times. He even moved out a few times but kept coming back. I finally broke up with him for good about six months ago. Anyway I understand why they are reluctant to just go back to the way things were in our friendship. I don't blame them for being upset with me and I fully plan to try my best to make it up to them and I'm grateful that they are willing to talk to me at all but... I'm not sure I like them anymore. We've been friends for so long. I seriously don't have anyone else in my life and I am afraid I am just doing the avoidant thing and looking for reasons to write them out of my life. I've done that with everyone else in my life but these two always seemed special and I feel like we've known each other so long they are family and I want to always know them but they aren't really being good friends anymore. I know people grow apart and I admit that I am the one who stopped talking as much initially and like I said I was and am more than prepared to make up to them the fact that I haven't been around but honestly I wasn't around because I was in a toxic relationship and I told them that every time I did get a chance to talk to them. I talked about how I was stuck for financial reasons and covid and that I was losing my mind to never be alone and they didn't help me. They didn't encourage me to get out or give me advice they just got more and more distant and now that I am broken up they tell me this guy was bad for me but they wouldn't tell me that when we were together and that's what I needed to hear from them. Instead they just acted like they liked my bf and talked bad about both of us to each other. I hate to say but it almost feels like they were enjoying me being in a bad relationship. Maybe I'm just paranoid. They say they forgive me but they don't talk to me very much. One really doesn't call me or answer me and the other calls all the time but I'm not allowed to talk about my relationship at all. He has hung up on me twice for even mentioning it. I get that he doesn't like my ex but neither do I and I was in a toxic relationship for three years I need to talk some of it through. I would never do that to them and god knows I have had to listen to some boring andor stupid problems of theirs repeatedly over the years. Why can't they do that for me?I know people out grow each other. They have made new friends and I need to as well but it's hard for me because well I have avpd. Ideally I would like to keep them as friends and make new friends that understand more about the person I am now instead of the person I was in high school. But the part of me that pushes people away wants to push them out and I don't know what to do?Do they get to treat me bad because I wasn't as accessible to them for a while? I was never completely gone I just couldn't be there as much. Do they get points for being friends with me so long? Should I just over look it?Or am I right that they are being disrespectful by telling me what I can or can't talk about hanging up on me if I mention something they don't like talking to each other and excluding me even if they are talking about coming into town and staying with me even when they are not invited? I have to work and they are on vacation but please come stay at my house and expect me to drop everything to do what you want? We never do what I want when they come to visit because I live here so I have to be on board to do everything they want to do.I know it's a long story. There is a lot more to it too but am I blowing things out of proportion and prematurely ending my longest and only friendships ? Or has the time apart from them given me clarity to see who they really are which is bossy and disrespectful of me and I should just try and make new friends that don't judge me so harshly like talking and listening to me and actually live in my town? TLDR I have had a hard life and I want to stand up for myself. But it's leaving me completely alone. Am I cutting out my friends too quickly?,Personality-disorder
51165,I firmly believe undiagnosed ADHD is a big part of the reason why I have this disorder Beyond emotional and sometimes physical neglect I always knew something was different about me. And not in a good way. I couldn't relate to my peers growing up and I could never figure out why. I was always too much. Too loud too weird too emotional. I never had the same interests as the other kids around me. Which made me sad because I wanted to but never did Then there's the fact that I couldn't catch on to jokes quickly which made me awkward. My poor attention span and memory made things worse. Sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor like grab something from a shelf and I couldn't follow directions. This happened a lot growing up. People getting frustrated with me or thinking there's something wrong with me because I couldn't follow directions. This evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed. If someone was telling me where to go I'd need a visual. A map or for me to write down their directions because I'll get lost. My short term memory is so bad. I remember my uncle was giving me his phone number we were moving and he had to leave and come back but I needed to be in contact with him. He recited the numbers and I couldn't remember what he said quick enough. I just always felt like I'm slow to process things. I still am. Someone will state a fact about themselves I'll look them in the face and nod like I was listening. But I wasn't so I repeat what they said back to them and they all give me this wtf look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago. Sometimes I forget the things I myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times. Again ending with people giving me this wtf is wrong with her? Look. Yikes. It doesn't help that I think I deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria. It takes very little for me to get flustered and embarrassed. It led to me lashing out at others as a child which ofc led to me being excluded eventually. I always overexpressed my emotions and I think that was off putting to other people. When I was happy I was very happy. When I felt a twinge of sadness I was crying when I was mad I was yelling and name calling.I had overall weird impulsive behavior. I would say the most random things and make really weird movements I still do but only at home lol. I think all of these things just made others reject me because I was so strange. And to avoid the harsh judgement I started masking all of my quirks but I lost myself in the process. I went from one extreme to the other. Instead of being overly expressive I isolate myself and I come off as cold uncaring and stuck up. But this couldn't be further from the truth. I truly do care about people but I'm emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem weird Sorry for all the rants and posts lately . I'm not actually sad this time. I think I'm just coming to accept there's a reason why I am the way I am and that I'm not just inherently defective.,Personality-disorder

50970,Natural brain dampener I have recently been experimenting with some substances and after three or more days of taking ashwagandha most of my AVPD chatter ceases it also dampens my need socialize or seek validation Not that I had much of that but at least now I don't care when I run out of things to say during a conversation before I was made uncomfortable by the thought seeming boring or long silence in conversation but with this I don't care at all.Its a very subtle effect though so I like it. I'm not going to pretend to understand how it works and I definitely don't recommend it because there are several people who have had severe adverse effects with it but I have found a new unintended use for it and I wanted to share this discovery.Sadly as a sad effect I find myself dragging my feet to do anything I just lose interest in almost everything.,Personality-disorder

In the past 6 years I have left my house like twenty times. I'm driven by AvPD and have very poor hygiene due to selfneglect and depression. I'm not skilled in anything not particularly intelligent either definitely not physically gifted and absolutely hideous.try to get a normal life with that background lol. I feel worthless I have so much shame against myself it sounds so hard. For the first time I want to find a way out and not rot in my room for the first time I have ambitions. It's so hard.
