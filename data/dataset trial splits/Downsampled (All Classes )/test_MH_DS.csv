52406,Is it normal for my body to feel so heavy and urge to just give up? I am nearly 2 months in having bad anxiety. Spring break I didnt really do much because my body felt so heavy as if it just wants to drop and rest. Especially my arms I can be on my phone laying down and it would randomly have the urge of just dropping. Raise your arm a bit and just drop it. Thats what I feel it wants to do. Its never actually dropped or anything just I get a feeling that it wants to as if someone is pulling my limbs down. I also notice when Im driving my foot just feels weird like heavy and when I turn the wheel too. And I feel weak. Im kinda new to anxiety and I just want to know if anyone else has or had this problem before and how to fix it.,Anxiety

35457,I wish I could just be normal Like it'd be super cool if I could just experience a minor stomach flu without being consumed by fear that it's actually something much worse. Normal people don't go to the emergency room because they threw up twice and have a low grade fever. They put a trash can next to the bed and go to sleep. ,Anxiety
35642,Concerned for CoWorker Vision Problems Im reaching out on behalf of a coworker. Over the past three weeks he has been having progressive problems with his sight. Im not sure of all the details but he has been to a family doctor an optometrist and a doctor that specializes in how the nerves relate to eye sight not a neurologist cant remember the name. Im not sure of all the tests performed but he claims to have explored just about every route possible and no one can tell him anything! I asked him what the next step was and he told me there were no next steps.He is 64 years old and has had cataracts previously but has been fine in the six years that Ive known him. He wears glasses due to being farsighted. The problems started about three weeks ago and have progressed to the point where he cant make out anything that he cant make anything out glasses or not that is more than about 1015 feet away from him. I was talking to him this morning and standing about that distance away and he said he couldnt make out the details of my face.From his explanation if you take each eye and break it off into quadrants each week he starts having problems in a new one. So he had problems in one quadrant in his right eye three weeks ago. Then problems in another and so on. Currently he has blurry vision in three of four quadrants in his right eye and one of four quadrants in his left eye. Beyond this I dont have much more info.Does anyone have any insight as to what this could be? Or what steps he could take?Thanks everyone!,Anxiety
34059,Possible Ear Infection? So my left ear is a bit red and itchy it also feels like its burning and its tender to touch in certain places especially just before the inside of the ear and behind the ear like the rounded bit on the outside.I think it might be my earphones that have caused the problem so Ive stopped using them for a couple days.Im not sure if this is something I should go to the doctor about or not. I know ear infections and stuff dont really need treated but I wasnt sure if I should just wait it out or go see a doctor about it. ,Anxiety

35462,Worried about stomach cancer Hi! 19 F here. For the past 6 months I get very nauseous very easily especially after eating or when stressed. Since around November Ive started puking regularly. Ill puke once a day for maybe a week then be fine for a week. During bad episodes I puke anywhere from 37 times a day. Ive been gaining weight since this happened. Havent vomited any blood red color is from foods I have eaten. Diarrhea usually precedes the vomiting and has a certain smell smell only occurs in diarrhea RIGHT before I puke. Immediately after puking the nausea goes away until the next episode. Symptoms worsen before exams presentations stressful events. Ulcer has been ruled out. My brain is going straight to the assumption I could have cancer and I am terrified ,Anxiety
52530,Travel Anxiety Hi all! Long time anxiety sufferer first time poster. I am diagnosed bipolar with generalized anxiety disorder. Due to a history of substance abuse I cannot take benzos which severely hinders my ability to be treated with medicine.Knowing that background I have SEVERE travel anxiety. Tomorrow I have to travel to NYC from CT which is a literal train ride plus the subway to get downtown and I am in a panic. Part of it is leaving my baby for the first time since I had him 9 months ago but a bigger part is that I just HATE traveling. The crowds the unknown the potential of getting lost it all sends me in a tailspin.Does anyone have any tips to ease me a bit? Ive already mapped out my route and gone over and over it. Ive thought of alternatives Uber taxis if the subway feels to overwhelming. What else can I do?,Anxiety

35404,Worried about my eyesight I suffer from visual snow I see a layer of static on my vision especially on dark surfaces and have a hard time seeing in dimmer light and while it's okay enough for me to ignore it most of the time recently it's been taking all of my attention. I feel like it's gotten worse and fear that I have some sort of disease that makes my retina deteriorate and it's just gonna keep getting worse until I'm blind. I scheduled an appointment to have it checked out but it's in a few weeks time. Part of me suspects I'm just anxious about my future but it's really hard to distract myself since most activities involve using my eyes and I'm obsessovely checking if my field of view has gotten worse or look for macular degeneration symptoms. I'm gonna bring the subject up with my therapist but in the meantime some voices of reason wod be greatly appreciated...,Anxiety

52465,I accidentally wore white to a wedding and can't stop shamespiraling Selfforgiveness with anxiety Yesterday I attended my boyfriend's cousin's wedding and wore a short creamcolored dress with a black pattern. The color literally did not occur to me when I got dressed. I picked it because I felt bloated and it was flowy and that's as far as my brain got.At the reception my boyfriend's mom spilled red wine on my dress. As I tried to dab out the stain I caught myself saying see this is why I never wear whiteand then it hit me. I spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change. I felt like such an asshole such an idiot and I still can't shake that feeling.I sat in the secondtolast row at the ceremony at the very end of the row away from the aisle thank God. It was a casual wedding. People were there in jeans. No one said anything to me. And it was genuinely an accident. A very stupid accident. But it was also my first time meeting my boyfriend's extended family and I'm now convinced they all hate me. I can't think about anything else. I feel like such a fuckup like I'm a bad person.Logically I know it's not the end of the world. I know if THAT was my biggest asshole move in recent memory I'm doing OK. But I don't FEEL any of that. Selfforgiveness seems truly impossible with anxiety sometimes.,Anxiety

34086,Stomach just WON'T stop acting up on fire etc. Would an MRI detect anything serious? I was sent to the hospital because my stomach was giving me immense trouble. They performed a colored MRI on me but I'm still worried because I don't fully understand what it's supposed to detect. If they were looking for like some sort of bowel thing would they have missed something like colon cancer or something serious? Does an MRI even detect stuff like that? They sent it to an outsourced radiology firm because they didn't have a radiologist onsite at night. The problem is my stomach still will NOT stop. It's acting up immensely. I've gotten over a lot of my health anxiety to the point where I've been off meds but I had to take a pill today to relax. My family does think something's wrong as I'm always fatigued pale nauseous etc. I'm getting a full blood work panel done soon because my iron was extremely low some time ago so they wanna check again also because diabetes runs in my family like crazy.Couple with an MRI and a full blood work panel this Wednesday what are the chances of them missing something?Thanks!lt3,Anxiety

52415,Did I have a panic attack? About a month ago I F 25 had what I think was a panic attack. Ive gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood family member has tired to take their life a few times but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 1112 and have only opened up about 90 with my long term boyfriend.In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasnt worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didnt talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasnt an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just dont understand why didnt snap out of it. Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training ironically and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame guilt embarrassment came rushing back. I didnt think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldnt keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that Im not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say infront of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here my boyfriend my family. I was telling the instructor that I dont normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing hadnt even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing. Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if hes not worried about me dying then maybe Im not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was a little bit of anxiety. Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then Ive had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as Im scared its going to happen in public and now Im being referred to therapy so Im not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless. Sorry for the long post.,Anxiety
35679,Afraid something is extremely wrong with my heart Hey guys. I lost my job in March due to Gastritis from unknown causes. Had an endoscopy and biopsies. It's just gastritis and they think it may be due to my gallbladder but I will be having tests for that in about a week. I have been extremely ill with that since the beginning of January. Lost almost 20 lbs. In pain all day. It's great. ANYWAY throughout this time and I think right before but only rarely I have been having having issues when I stand and start doing usual activities. My heart rate soars when I stand and when I begin doing everyday things nothing strenuous I even get sweaty sometimes and short of breath. This scares me so I have to lay back down and then it immediately goes back to normal. I have a history of PVCs the palpitation where your heart skips a beat. I saw a cardiologist and he did not see anything and said it was pretty good except he vaguely mentioned some part of the ultrasound being slower and he told me to exercise more. He didn't explain any of that. That was a year ago now. I realize I have been laying on the couch for about a month now but could that cause all this? I also often have low blood pressure but I've never had this happen everyday. Could it be any of these causes or maybe since I haven't been able to eat much anymore? My anxiety is driving me insane. Someone please help. ,Anxiety

35139,Why do I feel weak and sick all the time? Freaking out for a month now. Bloodworkuralysis results httpsimgur.comadivyBwVPlease click on the images and expand them before claiming they are too blurry to read. Thank you.Bilirubin was elevated but he said it was just Gilbert's syndrome? He is my new family doctor Canada. Old family doctor would have done all sorts of clinical examination feeling abdomen for things listening to abdomen with stethoscope neurological testing etc. but new doctor barely looks at me.Daily fatigue began last March improved somewhat in September then worsened again in January. I've been experiencing the following symptoms for the past month Muscle weakness hands and legs feel shaky and uncoordinated worried I'm going to drop glasses when I pick them up to drink legs shake while I'm walking up and down stairs etc. Worsens with exertion. Left hand feels weaker than right and sometimes has pins and needles sensation. Extreme drowsiness Brain fog Flushing in legs chest head and what feels like rapid temperature fluctuations from cold to warm. Lower left abdominal pain and discomfort. Nausea and dizziness Feel very hungry much of the time often shortly after eating. Gnawing feeling of hunger. Seem to never gain weight despite eating 4 meals a day. Mild urine retention due to tight bladder neck began 2 years ago diagnosed via cystoscopy in November Infrequent sharp pain near anusrectum Very twitchy eyelids Initially it was only my right eyelid but now my left eyelid twitches as well as eyebrow and upper cheek on right side.Stool is mostly normal but Undigested bits of food in stool Feel like bowels aren't completely voided but can't push the rest out. Feeling goes away after wiping. Stool sometimes broken up into large chunks instead of one long stool Stool sometimes thin and stringySymptoms can be up and down but mostly down and seem to correlate with food on some level although I can't figure out any meaningful pattern. I am unsure which symptoms are connected and which are not. The fatigue and weakness worsens with exertion even just going for walks making exercise difficult. I am a 30 year old male. I weigh 120125lbs and height is 56. I haven't had alcohol in over 4 years and I've never been a heavy drinker. I eat reasonably healthy meals and still maintain a reasonably high appetite in spite of these symptoms.Most distressing symptom by far is the fatigue and weakness. Can barely keep eyes open sometimes and it can feel like I'm tied to a ball and chain.I had an ultrasound and liver workup in addition to the bloodwork above which were apparently normal.Doctor believes I have somatic issues related to anxiety and refuses to do additional testing or refer me to any specialist. I cannot find a new doctor because there is an extremely long waiting list for family doctors. While I begged him for more investigation he practically sat there laughing at me and told me to go find another doctor if I wasn't happy.I am worried and my quality of life is suffering. Should I just keep going to the hospital until they agree to investigate? What should I do?,Anxiety

34527,A great simple technique for coping with health anxiety I posted this as a comment to another thread about panic attacks but thought it warranted its own post. It's adapted for anxiety from a similar method in Feeling Good The New Mood Therapy a book on depression by David D. Burns M.D.If you struggle with health anxiety or any kind of anxiety really give this a try the next time your worries start to get the better of you. I do it in an Excel spreadsheet but a notebook works fine too.The ThreeColumn TechniqueColumn 1 FearIn this column write down whatever's freaking you out at the moment I'm worried I'll have a heart attack out of nowhere or What if someone took what I said at yesterday's meeting the wrong way?Column 2 What triggered itWrite down what you were thinking feeling or doing when you started down your current worry spiral. For example I felt a skipped heartbeat or I felt my lymph nodes and they seemed a little swollen. Over time some triggers will appear more often in your notes than others helping you spot habits that get you into trouble.Column 3 Real talkNormally you only think of the worstcase scenario. This is your chance to do the opposite write down every reason you can think of that you'll be absolutely fine which by the way are exponentially more realistic scenarios. Go nuts the more you write the better you'll feel. For example my scariest symptoms are skipped heartbeats so when I feel one I list points like these Skipped heartbeats are perfectly normal most people have them and don't even notice Some people experience thousands of skipped beats a day and are perfectly healthy You already met with a cardiologist and she gave you a clean bill of health Skipped beats are a very common side effect of anxiety it's much more likely anxiety is the cause than some rare heart defect This aside I have zero symptoms of an underlying heart issue ...and on and on.The more you use this technique the more you'll notice the same fears and triggers popping up over and over again. And when you see that you'll see how often you worry about the same thing and how your worst fears are never ever realized.Hope this helps stay strong!,Anxiety
52251,Becoming hyperaware of your existence and feeling dissociated I'll add a little background first im a 35 year old male and have never had any diagnosed conditions or health problems in general. I have always been extremely shy social health anxiety low confidence never had a girlfriend no friends since I moved to a different part of the country when I was about 22. Over time I think I have been able to numb it down creating explanations and reasonings in my mind and used video games as an escape. For the last 10 years or so my life have beenampx200B Wake up and eat breakfast Go to work Come home and shower Make and eat dinner Some kind of workout Sit at computer Sleep and repeat Every other weekend I visit my mom who I spend quality time with and help out since she has a condition that keeps her from doing many things herselfampx200BBut a week ago i was hit like a truck with massive depression and anxiety realizing what my life have been these last 10 years. I feel like I have wasted so much time especially on the weekends where I was at home doing nothing instead of going to my mom or just doing anything productive. I got thoughts about existential dread death and what our purpose really is. I got crushing anxiety about my mom dying and me not spending enough time with her and also because she is the only person in the world that truly knows me understands me and that I can be myself with. ampx200BI feel like an alcoholic over 10 years who just suddenly stopped drinking from one day to the next now the video games do nothing for me I can't escape and I'm lost for purpose. My appetite is very unstable and my mind is racing especially when I try to sleep which has led to sleepless nights with my heart racing in panic and having constant disaster thoughts that I can't stop. I keep thinking Am I sick? Am I going insane? Do I have a brain tumor? and many more thoughts of that kind. I also get this weird feeling somethimes of being disconnected or dissociated to the world. I become hyperaware of my existence and my actions and thoughts and it makes everything feel weird. In this state I feel like im acting like myself when I'm with others like I'm something unexplainable controlling this physical body or seeing the world from a 3rd person view. Has anyone else experienced this or gone though something similar?ampx200BI have started on antidepressant and anxiety medicine and started seeing a psycologist but just wanted to share in hopes of getting some feedback or tools to combat these things.,Anxiety

52525,Anxiety Over Having Made No Accomplishments in Life I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a career like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games hating my life and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old it's over and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than this before now. If anything I could possibly say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse dealing with addiction an eating disorder and my anxiety issues. Yet at the same time I desire things that I'm 99 sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time. Is there any way to cope with the fact that my life just isn't going to get fixed and I'm pretty much doomed to waiting the clock out for the next 3040 years if I'm somehow lucky enough not to get cancer or some other terrible disease?,Anxiety
35787,I don't wanna eat Trigger Warning I do not know if this is the right subreddit for this if its not then please redirect me to a proper subreddit.I do not think know if this counts as an eating disorder or not. I think about not eating sometimes although I have not acted upon it. The reason why I don't want to eat is because of my periods. If I don't eat I will not get my period. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to menstruation. This post I made explains why.httpswww.reddit.comrmenstruationcommentsaf32dwiwannatalkaboutmenophobiamystoryMy period is the main cause of my anxiety. I'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about this. I'm tired of being not like everyone else. I just don't want to put up this anymore. I'd like to add that I haven't started to starve myself these are just intrusive thoughts. Although I kinda want to stop eating.I'm not calling this an eating disorder is because it has nothing to do weight or body image. As you can see this is very complicated. If I do stop eating I'll take everything into consideration.The only way for me to be happy is without my period. I'll eat when I don't have my period that month or whatever.I want to try to conquer my fear of sexmenstruation. But I know I can't do it. People on Reddit say that I should try to learn about what's going on in body so that I won't be afraid. I definitely can't do that. I'm a loser because of this.I blame myself a lot for being this fear. Its all my fault. I hit myself from time to time because I feel so stupid. I have not told my family that I think about not eating anything. I feel too guilty to tell someone. People already don't understand why I feel uncomfortable about sexuality and menstruation. Life sucks.Again if this isn't the place for this let me know.,Anxiety

Ever since then I've been convinced that I've acquired cancer of the mouththroat. I recently went to the dentist to check out some mouth sores and bumps and they were found to be nothing. For the last week and a half I've had some issues with what feels like swallowing on my right side of my throat. No real pain but also no lumps or bumps in my throat or neck to speak of. Recently though I chose to feel in the back of my throats and felt what feels like cartilagebone on the right side of my throat. It is a hard ridge and doesn't appear on my left side. I don't have any pain and haven't had any other symptoms to speak of. I'm wondering If anyone would have any idea what this is or maybe it's just normal and I'm overly paranoid due to my recent health anxiety. My fianc is a PA student and hasn't been overly concerned at all and at my physical a month ago a blood test showed normal white blood cell count. I still can't stop thinking it's cancer though and really looking for advicehelp on this. I've been through a lot of stress lately and just looking for some support. Any thoughts help or support would be much appreciated. ,Anxiety
51673,Scared to start Lexapro I have a crippling anxiety disorder and Ive been prescribed Lexapro. I have GAD but Ive noticed my anxiety has always been around my health especially my heart. Its gotten so bad that I barely leave the house and Im afraid to exert myself which is depressing because I used to be a gym rat and exercising was what I used to do help cope with my anxiety but thats not something I can do anymore Atleast In my mind I cant. This has really intensified over this past year after dealing with multiple panic attacks that have landed me in the ER and Ive been getting a bunch of physical symptoms constantly that does not help with my worrying. Ive had many tests done and the doctors are very reassured that Im healthy. My Doc believes the Lexapro will help me but I cant seem to find the courage to take it. Im just so terrified of it Id really appreciate some encouragement to start my meds because I high key hate living like this .,Anxiety

35327,Can health anxiety cause coldlike symptoms? Hey guys!Let me start off by saying that I suffer from pretty strong health anxiety but have recently started therapy to deal with it.Three weeks ago the very week I started therapy I caught a cold. It was a very difficult week as I pretty much thought I was dying.Anyway it has been two weeks since it has passed and since then Ive had pain in my throat on and off moving in different places in my throat sometimes the left side sometimes the right side sometimes the soft palate sometimes nothing at all. Yesterday after being very stressed out about some work things the pain came back in the right side of my throat pretty strong. This morning I woke up and now the left side is hurting and I have a ton of mucus insiste my nose too.Could my brain really be making all of this up? Does anyone suffer from throat pain from health anxiety?Sorry for the reassurance post guys Im just really tired of thinking about all this and I never google anything because I feel like Ill start feeling everything I read.,Anxiety
34141,I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care amp doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you. and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better. I feel like I can prove myself to him from this point forward but I don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. Hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one. Anyway thank you for reading!,Anxiety

Its like a falling or dropping sensation mostly when I'm sitting but sometimes happens to me while I walk around. I can feel it during less than a second it feels like when you use an elevator to go up or down in a building you know HAT feeling you have when the elevetor starts to move. Anyone can relate?

34840,Something that is really really helping me get over my HA Hi guys I'm a longtime sufferer of panic attacks and my health anxiety had gotten out of control. A long time ago a psychiatrist told me to read a book called Hope and Help for Your Nerves by Claire Weekes. I did not read it back then but just recently picked it up. It's an old Australian book first published in 1969 but it has been EXTREMELY helpful for me. I'm also on medication and I can't recommend antidepressants for HA enough but give this book a try. It's only 8 bucks on Amazon so it's not a huge investment. I hope this post helps someone out there! ,Anxiety

I overcook a lot of my food and throw a lot of stuff out. Right now I'm sat here worrying that the chicken I had earlier from a take out wasn't cooked properly.

35324,Health anxiety about Multiple Sclerosis? For the past year i have had neurological symptoms that lead me to googling then becoming fixated on MS. I started getting muscle twitches all over and on my mouth particularly then a tinglingbuzzing heel of my left foot muscle soreness on my arms tingling tip of nose and scalp various shooting pains and horrible neck pain. This was all on and off. My foot has been buzzing for months and months on and off. I had cancer when I was younger and my doctors think I just have health anxiety or neuropathy from old chemo which is uncommon anyways i got a new doctor and she scared me more because she told me it doesnt sound like full blown MS but i can do some tests basically even though she said it didnt sound like it she still didnt rule it out. that was enough to scare me into a spiraling panic. I google my symptoms every day read up On MS and im fully convinced i have it. I even posted on the MS forum here but now I wonder if it could all just be anxiety. Im terrified. Ive been obsessing over this for a year now. I havent had any debilitating symptoms like numbess or pins and needles or vision loss. I got a full eye exam and they said my eyes were 100 percent healthy. Not sure what I should do at this point,Anxiety
34828,Does this just sound like anxietydepression? Hey! I know you guys arent doctors and I am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists but I was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight.I feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels.ampx200BSometimes I just get these episode where everything gets scary. I just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. My life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. Usually a small sound such as my fridge PC anything really will seem to grow louder and seem eeriespooky. My thoughts go down this loop of Do I have some sort of serious chronic mental illness will I feel this way forever will it get worse? And of course I try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can but the feelings are still there and very real. Sometimes I get very weird and super brief thoughts of doing rash things flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example. It feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes but not usually Ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks because they way other people describe there's I feel as though mine are a lot different. ampx200BAnother thing to add is over the summer I did acid for the first time and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.ampx200BIf anyone could give me some insight or share what their crippling anxiety feels like I would love to hear it. Thanks guys nn,Anxiety
34342,Found a swollen lymphnode Now Ive had health anxiety since I was 4. Ive had every cancer known to man and many other various diseases but Ive never actually had any concrete symptoms. Until 2 weeks ago.I was at work and felt a lump in my neck was extremely scared had a panic attack but I told myself it was just a lymphnode and to get over it. Ive gotten pretty good at being able to brush my symptoms off so for about two weeks I kinda forgot it was there. Until like 3 days ago when I felt my neck and it was still there!

52704,Overwhelming Fear of Blindness amp Deafness. How Can I Overcome? I've had an overwhelming fear of blindness and deafness for years.I developed tinnitus when I was in high school due to exposure to loud music. My tinnitus isn't awful I'm able to be productive around it. But ever since then I've been fearful of one day losing all my hearing.Also I've been fearful about blindness due to a family history of sight issues dry eye syndrome occasional eye floaters and the fact I often work late nights on my laptop.I saw a doctor about the eye floaters but was told that those are normal and most people get them.I'm conflicted because I have a smartphone compulsion which feeds my fear of visual impairment.I just want to know how I can overcome these fears because they often give me anxiety and I almost cried once out of fear my vision was getting cloudy.I'm sure it's not the end all be all but I fear I won't be able to achieve my dreams filmmaking if my sight and hearing are affected.Would really appreciate any words of encouragement and help.

52655,Why can't I believe what the doctors tell me? I 26 M am super frustrated with myself today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux. The cardiologist did some blood pressurepulse checks to rule out POTS and said I was fine on that front. The EKG came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape. I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something. My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.Edit I should note I am very aware that I have health anxiety and I am currently in therapy for it already It still bugs me though.,Anxiety
35683,i thought i was done with this ive really been doing so much better with overall health anxiety since last year when it reached a peak. my main anxiety is emetophobia but ill get anxious about pretty much anything or at least i used to. this summer i got on medication and did therapy and everything has been largely fine since then. its just right now that things seem to be snowballing. i picked up some kind of stomach thing because its going around my school and as soon i got past my original fear of vomiting i was largely ok. i even felt almost normal the next day. however i ate food that i guess was too adventurous and ever since then ive been feeling crappy. i also have been bleeding on my past pack of birth control and its been getting steadily worse so i cant tell if the cramping and overall bad feeling is from that the virus or just anxiety. i have an appointment at my student health on tuesday but i cant call out of work again tomorrow and im not looking forward to it at all.,Anxiety
34014,Paranoid about a healing bump on the forehead So almost two weeks ago last Monday I decided to go to Urgent Care because of chest pains. On my way to the car I opened the door and it whacked me in the forehead.I had a huge egg on my forehead above my right eye and it has almost gone down completely. The only bump is a small vertical line raised that isn't much longer than 34. But because it is a line and it hurts to touch it as well as after touching it my brain is telling me I'm going to die of a blood clot or a stroke. Can someone please help convince me this isn't the case? Dumb brain trying to scare me.,Anxiety

35502,Absolutely terrified and think I have cancer. I know I shouldn't be posting this but I have gotten myself into such a state. I can't stop crying and hyperventilating I feel sick I can't sleep the list is endless. In February I got a letter from my doctor telling me my urine sample contained a small amount of blood which was not due to infection and I would need to be investigated. Said urine sample was taken about 3 or 4 days after my period ended. I still haven't gone back to the doctor out of fear of being told I have something serious.However on Tuesday 12th March I went to the toilet and noticed a significant amount of blood in my pee and I was extremely frightened. My period is due this week however it still hasn't arrived for some odd reason. I'm definitely not pregnant and surely blood in my urine isn't normal. I was hoping this was just spotting due to hormones but I doubt I am that lucky. I'm shaking as I type this. What if it's kidney bladder ovarian or any other cancer? Isn't this the warning sign? I really don't want to die I've finally found happiness and I'm doing well in life it's just NOT FAIR!!!ampx200BPlease tell me blood in urine doesn't always mean cancer???,Anxiety

51988,Fear of Hitting People To preface I am not clinically diagnosed with anxiety. However I'd like to think that there's something going on in my brain that's resemblant of anxiety. I'm not sure where else to post this so my apologies if this is an inappropriate subreddit to do so.I've come to realize that I have a deep fear of hitting people. I don't believe this was induced by anything during my childhood I led quite a happy normal one. However I've recently realized that I would never hit someone even if it came down to selfdefense and it's quite deterring. I simply can't bring myself to cause direct physical damage to someone it feels like my muscles just disintegrate on me and my brain is doing everything possible to convince myself not to hit them. I don't know if I'm overthinking this or if this is something of genuine concern?,Anxiety
34313,Premature Heart Beats This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with. I have had premature atrial contractions premature junctional contraction and premature ventricular contractions for like 4 years now. At one point I was in bigeminy for 1.5 months. Scariest and most depressing time of my life. I could not leave the house and was in constant discomfort. I went to every doctor and they all claimed they were benign. Cut out this add this don't exercise too much exercise more.This is what gives me Health anxiety. There's nothing I can do about it. All my doctors including my Mayo cardiologist and electrophysiologist says an ablation would more than likely make things worse. So I live with these day in and day out. I've tried everything. The best thing I have is magnesium glycinateWhat do you do when the something you can't fix.? But you still have to go on. I'm not even worried about them killing me but they caused me so much discomfort that it affects my quality of life.

I'm so scared that these side effects will never stop and that I have poisoned myself. My chest arms and back have been aching and fatigue. I am so sad that I started these because I'm scared this is going to end up killing me. Sites or other reddit users keep using the words poison or ruined my life etc. I'm jus scared it won't stop.

I rely on external approval from other people to make me feel good. For example when someone gives me a dirty or unfriendly look I get upset. When someone doesn't smile at me I think it's because they think something is wrong with me. When people smile at me or are friendly to me I get happy.

I keep falling back asleep after I hit snooze and I have intense dreams right away then my alarm goes off again and the same repeats until I drag myself out of bed because I'm too hungry. I am extremely tired all day as if I had multiple sleepless nights in a row while I actually sleep 11 hours per night. I'm Feverish but no fever most of the time I feel like my forehead and eyes are hot and heavy cold chills with sweating extreme fatigue muscular pain all over. I feel like I can't function properly I'm sluggish and think slowly my mind is clouded. My eyes keep going out of focus randomly. When someone talks to me their voice echoes in my head as if it was waking me up while I'm already up and awake. I randomly start falling asleepzone out even when standing up and get a falling sensation when trying to resist. It's true I had insomnia for awhile and whatnot but I don't know why I keep being so tired now that I am sleeping. I do wake up multiple times per night because my mouth is dry or because I have to pee or other things but it's not really new. I think my sleep is just not normal or something is very wrong with me.I'm tired of being tired. I've convinced myself I probably have leukemia anemia sleep apnea narcolepsy or something else. I don't even have the energy to go to the doctor.Am i dying?Edit I've been taking Nexium for 5 months and the leaflet says it can mess with your white blood cells causing intense fatigue pain all over and a fever.

34142,My HIV hypochondria is acting up again Hey guysSo I had been sleeping with this guy Rob on and off since 2016 and around August last year I started to get anxious about his status after stalking his exes facebook. I noticed she had cold sores on her lips and the last time I saw her in 2015 I saw her with cold sores. At first I thought it was normal because lots of people have and get cold sores but when I saw a recent picture of her on Facebook with the same if not worse cold sores. This concerned me because to my knowledge only people who are immuno compromised get recurring cold sores that often. I had spoken to Rob about his status earlier and he assured me he was healthy and I chose to believe him but after speaking to one of my girl friends she was surprised at how quick I was to believe him. She said verbatim guys can lie and I don't trust these uni boys keep in mind I live in Kenya where HIV is prevalent. This comment really freaked me out and I was sure he lied to me. I started freaking out and going crazy because of the picture of his ex coupled with my friend's comments I was sure I had contracted the virus. At this time I started sending him cryptic messages alluding to him infecting me but he didn't get which then forced me to plainly ask Are you HIV positive? He quickly replied No I'm not. I checked you also checked and I went and got tested and my results returned negative this wasn't a rapid test it was the one you wait two days for. I felt so bad about accusing him and we stopped speaking. Skip forward 3 months and we start fucking again. We met up and fucked 2 more times before I officially ended it for good. Now my mind is going back to thoughts that I'm HIV positive again. I keep thinking that maybe the first 6 times we met up and fucked the virus missed me and on the last 7th and 8th time the virus may have stuck. Is that possible? TLDR Had been hooking up with a guy since Dec 2016 and started getting anxious about his HIV status. Got tested in August 2017 and results came back negative. Started fucking him again in October 2017 and stopped in November. Is it possible that he is positive and the virus missed me the first 6 times we fucked and got me the last two times we did it? ,Anxiety

I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing. 28M.I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel wellprepared to take headon especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.Specifically I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fightflight responses around takeoff and aviophobia or fears when the plane is in the air. I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. But as I lay on my side writing this I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.It's crazy I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight to sleep to cry to indulge in selfhatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today because it was not going to get done. I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear it.I still want to fly deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.,Anxiety

34612,Side effects from taking my adderall in the morning and drinking alcohol in the afternoon around 3pm? ive been on vacation in the bahamas since march 31st til yesterday april 8th. Everyday we were super active always going out on the boat in the sun all day. On April 7th i took 20mg of adderall 3 times that day spread out between 2hrs each dose. So all together that day i had 60mg.and about an hour and a half later of my last dose i drank two rum punches throughout 3 hours time. After that about 2 and a half hours later i had 2 other rum punches again in a spand of 1 and a half hours. I never got drunk just felt pretty tipsy and good. I went to bed around 1030pm feeling fine not drunk at all. I woke up around 1230am with heavy vertigo and my stomach started hurting i went back to sleep hoping i would feel better in the morning. Well i woke up around 7am to get ready to leave for our flight and the vertigo was back and the stomach pain. I only puked twice i felt better after i got home in florida around 4pm i was 80 back to normal. I went to bed around 10pm last night and woke up today around 8am i feel like im in a daze like sleepy but i feel very out of it i feel depressed and have loads of anxiety which i already have normally i dont know whats wrong with me im freaking out im scared this has permanently damaged my brain and in going to feel like this forever. Is it because im off vacation? Or because a counteractment with my adderall and alcohol? Someone please ease my mind i hate feeling this way. And any pointers on how to get myself back to normal ,Anxiety

34151,Wheezing constricted airways after exercising in the cold I've been doing the Couchto5K running program for about a month. It's been in the 40s and 50s a lot lately when I go running. I'm able to complete my runs fine but I notice after getting home that the deepest parts of my lungs feel tight or constricted. I can force a deep breath but when I do I hear this wheezing like the airways are stretching back open. Usually after about 30 60 min or so it's back to normal.I tried wearing a neck gaiter after the first time and it got a lot better but was still there. I went to the doctor and described all this and he listened to my lungs. He said my lungs sounded perfect. And that it's normal to have that wheezing after exercising in the cold since your airways constrict and forcing them open creates a spasm that makes that wheezing sound. He also said as long as it's only that and not actual shortness of breath then it's nothing to worry about and to continue running preferably when it stops being cold.Anyway just wondering if anyone else can relate to this or can offer any other support. It is an irrational thing at this point since I've been to the doctor and described exactly what was going on to him. Knowing the way my anxiety works I suspect the reasons I haven't dropped it are that he didn't hear it actually doing it and to me it sounds strange and that I secretly worry it's a small start to a bigger lung issue I've had a couple relatives pass away after getting pulmonary fibrosis which definitely is in my head when anything lungrelated is going on. Any tips or other support would be fantastic!PS I refuse to google it or anything else for that matter but if anyone has support for pulmonary fibrosis worries that would help too. I believe for my relatives that started with gradually dropping oxygen levels and some strange sounds the doctors could hear in their breathing. So nothing like what I'm describing here .. if only health anxiety used the rational side of the brain!,Anxiety
34036,I think School gave me social anxiety story is since I was born until I was 12 I was bullied no big deal because I am not traumatized and I am actually in good terms with my old classmates now but being bullied made me what people call a NEET I don't mind talking to people or going outside.... well I guess I do set some limits to myself when it comes to socializing to the point I am almost always quietI blame the school system at least on my country because it's made in a way that even when I moved to the US it just isn't easy to socialize with others because you have to be quiet or talk low this also gave me troubles with talking low usually it's hard for me not to well I scream a lot when I watch videos I am kind of crazy xd but in my comfort zone only and well I spent most of my days on a pc watching videos and having funMy parents also just don't know how to take care of a child you see I got depression and maybe something else thanks to my dad he isn't abusive he does things for a good purpose but the way he does it made me hard to tolerate him the slightest thing even just saying a bad joke if it comes from him it would make me mad over the line and I don't want to feel like that but I can't avoid it I dunno why it's just how he made me. I also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why I don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when I actually do want to they just don't let me I almost never go to my friends houses I had a friend who didn't care when I went but hey after 2 visits I couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective I don't hate them for that not even mad I just dislike how few chances I have of doing stuff like thatI think I am forgetting something.... I don't know.... I am not diagnosed with social anxiety nor seen anyone to tell me I have that but I dunno my man I am trying to explain my story but it's so badly structured that I just want to get to the point I am a NEET and I am used to live on the internet just chatting with people through text messagesbut today I tried VRChat and I just.... couldn't talk I wanted to but I couldn't most of the times I just think my voice isn't right for my words and a lot of times I just don't know I can't maybe I feel insecure? I just wonder if there's a way to fix this.... I don't think it's deepI don't feel pretty good now I was getting too bored in the game and I got tired of not doing a thing in VRChat my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without VR and it still gave me the chills to interact with them. I am frustrated because my voice... it isn't bad but I can't think of a avatar who would fit it my own appearance doesn't fit with my voice and even though I know many people have appearances that don't fit their voices my words my words are just what can't get out by just thinking how it will sound or saying it to listen to itThis is annoying I don't really hate my life I had fun when I was 10 and didn't have any friends just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game and I still had fun when I got friends on the internet or people to talk to ironically people ruined that fun a little bit xd at the price of making it more fun I am having fun now but now well I just handled depression I guess but talking to people is still something hard to do for me at least I got friends in my school but I am still just too quiet and I am annoyed by that I also find it almost impossible to start conversations or just impossible but without speaking.... meh it feels like there's no risk I dunno when I type I don't think I could mess up not because of my voice but it's still pretty hard but I think that's how it is usually hardI wanna add that my family aren't something I can call friends or people to talk to they have a lot of issues that are responsible for who I am now I also almost never talk to them specially when I just think there's nothing to talk about with most people actually but there's a fewer amount of topics with themAnd well that's my thing I just want to know if there's something I can do sorry for wasting your time this is a mess I don't normally make such a mess when I type stuff but this is one of the things I found the hardest to talk about not emotionally I usually make a mess when I find things hard to explain or to type but this one is just the worst xd oh wellat least I am not always like this there are times where I just have energy,Anxiety

35448,Worried about possible Petechiae So for the past few weeks Ive been having these tiny pinpricksized red or sometimes brown dots appear on my skin. Of course the anxious side of my brain has decided that Im dying of leukemia or some other cancer even though I have no other symptoms that point towards it. Whats especially odd is that these spots appear in certain areas and then go away after a few days. The first time they appeared was on my right hand and arm after I spent the night with my girlfriend. After about two days they went away. Now theres some of these little spots on my right foot and ankle and seemingly nowhere else on my body. Anyone else have something like this occur? Ill probably see my doctor in a few days and see what she thinks but until then that anxious part of me is absolutely certain that Im a dead man walking.,Anxiety
50186,Telling people you are bipolar I just wanted like opinionsconsensus on this cuz Im curious. Who in your life do you tell that you are bipolar? I think this might be a bit of a generational difference here too. I work in healthcare and hear the way people talk about bipolar patients all the time I dont have many GenZ coworkers for context most GenX boomers or millennials and its abysmal. Im a millennial for context. They talk about us the same way people would talk about people convicted for domestic abuse or a hit and run or a violent crime. Just disdain. So I would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers. So I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they dont have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they arent speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say. Ive noticed younger people like people on tik tok or like just in general not only talk about it but put it front and center as a key piece of their identity. They put it in cover letters that go out to job applications and to me this just seems wildly nave. I wish we didnt live in that world but we have negative stereotypes about being late being unreliable or substance abuse issues and even though a lot of us dont do those things often or at all. People who have power to dictate important parts of our lives like what jobs and opportunities we have will go with default assumptions like those and will go with the safer pick the person who doesnt specify that or the one who doesnt have that info readily available on tik tok youtube insta Facebook. I appreciate awareness generally but I would caution people about where they are broadcasting what and to whom. Dont give other people a reason to slam the door on you before they even meet you. Curious what other people from all different age groups think.,Bipolar
45926,Medical marijuana does it help or hurt? I have a few diagnosed mental health conditions. I was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety as a child and cyclothymia as an adult. My current therapist sees BPD traits too.I changed psychiatric care providers and during my intake appointment the APRN suggested medical marijuana. They told me it would increase the efficacy of the stimulant and mood stabilizer I am on. They also claimed they would be able to replace the benzos I dislike taking.My childhood was absolutely difficult but I don't really see how it would result in PTSD the only psychiatric condition that medical marijuana is approved for in my state I am looking for studies and information about the use of medical marijuana in combination with traditional psychiatric care and therapy. Is there any validity to the claims it will help boost my medication? I am quite interested in CBD for anxiety. I have used marijuana in the past recreationally and of course I like it. Just this fact makes me feel like a big phony. I'm concerned but mostly because I can't find much research on it. Any help is appreciated. ,Bipolar

45990,ADD Inattentive and BiPolar II ... anyone else? Hi there I am 30 yo female who was diagnosed as ADD Inattentive in Highschool prescribed all those study candies and made it through college where I began binge drinking and smoking pot... also had a bout of serious depression and started Lexapro which lasted only about two years . I am very petite and was taking high doses of Vyvanse 70mg and also Adderall 30mg tab for studying. I had what I would call my first episode in college after smoking a bowl... fast forward to five years out of college and still taking Adderall and vyvanse and ambien gained about 40lbs. I wanted off of that shit so I quit taking it and quit seeing my doc. When I didnt have any left since I stopped seeing the doc I became addicted to Benadryl 3 at night just to sleep. Anyway I went on a trip and got some pot candy and I got sick and then I was prescribed a 10 mg prednisone. Thats when the mania started it was full blown mania for about 10 days before I went to the hospital. I dont remember everything but I was signing everything! I couldnt stop it was weird. Anyway sorry for the long post my new doc has me on Seraquel 200mg and vistiril along with a bunch of supplements I am trying to get away from big pharma. My problem is now I am still very distracted due to the inattentive ADD during work I dont work and Ill pick at split ends or google stuff thats irrelevant. My new doc said NO to stimulants and even said I should not drink coffee. He also said I can do pot or alcohol but it is disinhibiting so basically watch out. Now I am in a depressed state and I should be happy. My question to others is how do you deal with bipolar and inattentive add? Its a tough combo but I am trying to take things one day at a time. ,Bipolar
45932,Trigger heavy i guessDepression is back again. And i'm scared. I was doing so well. I got back to school. Life was going fine.I wasted 6 years doing nothing because my mental health always gets in the way and DESTROYS everything.But out of nowhere it all comes back again. School is getting harder day by day. The first hint of melancholy has transformed into a cold apathy and desire of self destruction.I cannot handle failure this time. Not again.I usually don't self harm because i really dislike self inflicted pain even though i am a masochistic by nature but i still managed to stab straight into my cephalic vein just so i could bleed.This is not me. But i never know at what state my mood is in before it is all too late. I feel the same as always. But all the signs are there.The spark happiness and light is gone and now i just feel this disgust. This is the darkest and most ominous my depression has ever felt even if it isn't the most severe it has been.I want to rip out my guts. Bleed out all my blood. Set myself on fire. Just purely destroy myself.This can't go on. I can still prevent this from getting worse but i don't know who to reach out to or even that should i. Everyone is too scary. I feel like i just need to hide and wait for this to pass instead of getting into trouble by talking to people.Sorry if my text is a bit incoherent or rambly. I don't even want to think about these things much less write about them and it makes my brain go fucking haywire. I just need something external to tell me this is not okay because i never feel that anything is wrong even if it is hitting me in the face. Be it escalated moods or bedridden depression. I just never feel my own moods.,Bipolar
46547,Hello I'm new to this particular sub but have been a member of the other one for a little while now.I was diagnosed bipolar 2 in September of last year. Before that it was depression anxiety and OCD. I've been going through a really bad depressive episode here lately. I'm on Cymbalta Buspar and Seroquel. The Seroquel actually helps...not so sure about the other two.I'm often overcome with feelings of hopelessness and to a degree don't want to leave my house. The OCD has been kicking in hard too. I wake up every morning with this sense of dread and anxiety which I have to grit my teeth through. I'm unemployed and nothing that I used to like doing brings me joy anymore. I'm married and my husband is awesome but I feel like such a burden.Anyways it's good to know that there is a community for us.,Bipolar

45935,Differences between bipolar 1 and 2? So a week ago my therapist told me I was displaying symptoms of bipolar disorder and at the time he thought I was manic with that being said what are the differences between bp1 and 2 other than hypomania and mania? And how can I tell the difference between a manic episode and a hypomanic episode?? I'm seeing a psychiatrist this week two actually trying to see if I should switch and I'm kind of??? Really confused. I'm not sure if when my therapist said manic he meant hypomanic or if it was just an assumption and I shouldn't even be here. I'm just struggling with figuring this out..,Bipolar
46371,Weird hypomania or am I just an idiot? Ever since my diagnosis 2 years ago I've gotten pretty good at recognizing my hypomanic symptoms...after the fact at least but more than a few times I've had experiences where I just have one maybe two symptoms for a week or two then one or two days that might actually qualify as something. Uniformly it's pleasurablerisky behavior being more goal oriented. I have pretty high self esteem all the time unless I'm depressive so I can't use it to judge unless it's gotten to the point where I think about running for office or starting a cult that's pretty obviousI don't get flight of ideas sleeplessness distracted pressured speech etc during these times. When I'm full blown hypomanic I get at least 50 of the above.So what does this mean? Is it hypohypomania? Am I just making stupid or rash decisions?,Bipolar

45636,contemplation I'm sitting here in my trailer I'm living at a ski resort at the moment for my job. It should be my dream job but I feel so empty and alone.. even when I'm with people. I have been manic for the past 6 months and it was beautiful except for the intermittent psychosis ofc. But fuck I want to be psychotic.. it's certainly better than this. I've just taken an oxycodone adderall.. drinking a beer.. I cut again night before last and i've even found my non dull razors.. I feel nothing and yet everything at the same time.. I feel so fucking dramatic right now but I figured if anyone could understand it would be other people like me. Idk why I think being psychotic would be better than this but I guess it's because im confident. My hallucinations and delusions ARE real... I dont feel real right now. I feel like a bag of bones hence why I want to cut into it. idk what to fucking do but is anyone else struggling to keep their grip on reality.. but secretly just wants to fall headfirst into it. I hate my illness but the symptoms and coping skills albeit harmful and self destructive i've come to know and love over the years of having this illness just seem so appealing and comforting to me rn. thanks for your time. ,Bipolar

49998,Bipolar amp Resilience Hey everyoneI am far from a inspirational speaker but I wanted to just hop on and say that when it comes to my BiPD I feel I am a much stronger person because of it. I grew up with a mom who likely had the disorder as well but took the path to meth as her escape and my dad was always working and never there. I grew up on my own and didn't find out I had the disorder till I was in my late teens. I wasn't able to go to college and I struggled to find work that was a fit and take care of myself for a bit but now I am happy to say I found the best job and make more money without a degree than most.This IS NOT me bragging I say all of this to show that I think we all forget sometimes that while having this disorder is a struggle it can teach us a lot of lessons. It also allows many of us to think differently and that can be a benefit. The problem is finding a way to get to stability to be able to use it in a way that doesn't make us selfdestruct. I know it's hard understatement of the year and everyone has to find thier own path because it is definitely not one size fits all. I hope anyone who sees this knows there is hope it's the small wins that keep it alive. Small ones lead to larger ripples in life. Anyway just wanted to share my two cents if it's not for you feel free to pass on by. Not looking for hate mail.,Bipolar

50012,unloved I feel like Im too hard to love. Im in my late 20s and I have bp II. Ive been medicated and going to therapy regularly for years but I still have mood swings etc. i thought I managed it well? Im a lesbian and I try really hard to make relationships work but in the end Im always too much. I even escaped an abusive one. It hurts so badly. Especially when i think about the fact that in multiple relationships when my partners were going through their depressions not bipolar but reg depression I held them down to the point of putting their needs and feelings above my own and neglecting myself which I now know is unhealthy. And then they get better..But the second I start struggling Im too much and they dont know if they can do it. Its frustrating because Im really upfront about the fact that I have bp II and theyll say it doesnt matter etc but when the symptoms show up they bail. If you ask my exes or anyone Ive dealt with romantically 9 times out of 10 theyll describe me as sweetbubbly and one said I was amazing. But if thats true why cant they love me. I just want to be loved. I want to get married one day and maybe have a child and live happily ever after but I feel like thatll never happen for me or it wont last because Ill have an episode and everything will be ruined.,Bipolar

50022,Bipolar Disorder type II is compromising my relationship and I feel beleaguered. How do others navigate relationships while undermedicatedstill finding out which meds work for them? I have recently moved in with my partner from across the nation. We had known each other for a long time since we were in the same communityfocused nonprofit organization. We had spent a substantial time building an intimate rapport with each other and we began to fully believe we were madly in love with each other. Unfortunately when I moved in the true depth of my mental unwellness quickly forced its way to the surface. My bipolar disorder shares a dangerous comorbidity with various other mental injuries to include combat PTSD from my time in the Marine Corps community trauma from being raised in poverty and general childhood trauma which has resulted in an additional major depressive disorder diagnosis. My mood cycles rapidly as in several times in one day rapidly. The resulting agitation fills my head with various examples of why the relationship will never work despite her initial fervor to cater to my every need. Now shes exhausted beleaguered and on the precipice of lapsing back into previous trauma behaviorshe has PTSD from witnessing her exfiance shoot himself in the head right in front of her. I have become the single most stressful thing in her life and Ive repeatedly attempted to leave the relationship as a result but she would refuse to let me leave. Im exhausted and I have a maelstrom of dark thoughts swirling through my head. Our relationship has devolved into resentment petty squabbles and she no longer has the energy to convince me to stay when I feel compelled to flee from the relationship even though she states she still wants me to stay even if she doesnt have the energy to stop me from leaving. I cant seek solace in my partner because we have become a point of contention in each others lives and if I keep venting to my best friend shell begin to grow resentful of my partner for being what she may perceive as unhealthy for me even though I share a large portion of the blame for causing our relationship to devolve to this point. She constantly states how she needs support and cannot withstand the capricious nature of my mood swings on her own which breaks my heart to hear because now Im fully convinced that I am far too much more trouble than Im worth and that I am no where near at a point in my mental health recovery to be a healthy boyfriend.Who has experienced something similar and how did they navigate such an emotionally compromising situation?,Bipolar
47021,Does exercising help? Hey I know that exercising can be helpful for people with depression anxiety and other mental health problems.

He says he loves me unconditionally he supports me in both my highs and lows he genuinely cares about me sometimes i wonder how a broken girl like me got so lucky?Any guy or girl would have ran as soon as they heard me say i can cure depression... but he didn't he just tried to ground me in reality and ofc recommend i go to the psych ward which i eventually did.Just thought i'd post something a little bit more positive this time around.I'm happy,Bipolar

49810,Hypomaniamania doubt Does anyone ever feel like their hypomania or mania isnt that bad when in reality it is? Im always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isnt even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently its been getting worse as Ive had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode my mania was only feeling really confident or believing I had superpowers or paranoia that everyone was looking at me and my irritation was really bad. Like I was screaming at my computer today. Just wanna know if anyone also thinks their not bipolar because their mania isnt even half as bad as they read some peoples experiences,Bipolar
50119,sometimes i feel like im just fine does anyone ever feel like they just dont even have bipolar anymore. i know i do and its never gonna go away and the way ive been feeling is literally me BEING BIPOLAR but sometimes i feel the same way for so long that i just feel like its gone. ive been in what feels like a constant depressive episode since august even though i know i have had bouts of mania or psychotic episodes but i just feel like they didnt last as long or werent as severe as they usually are. i got my meds upped around the time the mania calmed down so i know its a good thing but i cant help but feel like its bad. its not that i dont want to be better its just that im so used to feeling insane constantly and i feel like now that everything has calmed down a little it feels like its just over. ive been so depressed since november that its so hard for me to get out of bed and take care of myself at all most days and i hate it. i also hate how fast i switch up and how i go from laughing and feeling normal to being extremely angry and crying. thats another thing i feel like ive developed these huge anger issues and ive been lashing out and being so mean to everyone for no reason. i have such a hard time verbally apologizing so it makes me feel even more like shit. i feel like im never going to be able to live a normal life or like genuinely feel better and have it last lol. i feel like i cant handle or cope with anything the way i used to and ive just become so mad at the world. i havent self harmed since last summer and i know its a huge achievement but sometimes i feel like it was keeping me grounded in a way. idk if anyone else ever feels like that. i just hate being stupid,Bipolar
45850,Waiting to get into a doctor I moved to Florida about a year ago and I had a lapse in insurance coverage. I used to be on a lot of medication that helped several things and finally had me functioning as an adult. I ran out of these meds about 8 months ago but Ive been managing pretty well lately until this past week. Ive been working a full time job and I deal with stressful people day in and day out. It usually doesnt get to me but I havent been able to get in to see a doctor and I feel so frustrated. Ive had some really bad lows and some mild highs but I feel myself dipping down really low again and Im worried Im going to fuck everything up. On top of having bipolar I also have ptsd and anxiety. Depending on how my bipolar is being treated these things kind of make one or the other worse at times. Im just really frustrated and Ive worked really hard to get to where I am and I dont know how to keep control of everything when I cant even get a doctors office to call me back and schedule me. I dont have a support system anymore and I just feel helplessly lost. I dont usually post personal stuff like this on reddit and Im on my phone and pretty mixed up so sorry for poor writing. ,Bipolar

I have more energy than before but burned down my studies and social life because of my depression and I still feel like shit.Im not bad enough for inpatient and theres no intensive outpatient where I am and I barely have therapy. I dont know what to do Im glad Im not just crying staring into nothingness and sleeping anymore. However theres only so much drawing reading and bingewatching I can do and I feel like Im slowly going mad with boredom but I dont know where to find meaning right now.

49852,antipsychotics seem like a bit much been depressed for a while had first manic episode a few months ago but doesn't seem that intense compared to other people's here. I was on an SNRI at the time that my psychiatrist stopped.now I'm in full depression again but he wants to put me on antipsychotics and I feel like that's a lotdont wanna do it especially considering the side effects!!but SNRI's are off limits because of triggering the mania SSRIs and Wellbutrin haven't worked I'm on lamictal and that hasn't worked kind of running out of options.I'd rather go unmedicated than doing the antipsychotics Abilify in this case. I don't feel like I'm psychotic even in my mania it was barely psychoticfeeling like I could feel objects emotions. I started crying in the psychiatry office because I feel so bad about myself that nothing works for me and also that I might have to take some drug that leads to decreased brain volume and weight gain hair loss dementia Parkinson's etc.So at what point do antipsychotics actually become necessary??note I'm not asking for medical advice just people's experiences,Bipolar

50429,Just started the process of getting diagnosed Ive spent years in denial despite obvious signs Hey everyone to start Im a 21 year old female living in the United States. I come from a family that has a close history of Bipolar and ADHD. My grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication hes an addict and has been separated from my family since I was a child. Ive shown signs of being bipolar for a very long time now was diagnosed with ADHD got on the meds for that but still struggled significantly. I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. I have mixed feelings Ive known that this was most likely the answer but I didnt want it to be true. I hate that I have to be the one in my family to carry the bipolar role I know they will look down on me and assume Ill end up the same way that my grandpa did.,Bipolar
45712,Stuck in a loop When I'm depressed I'm really careful Always feel anxious about every little decision. Constantly going over every possibility in my head and thinking about all the things that could go wrong.As a result I get really upset when things don't go to plan .. The problem is when things go right mania sets in and I get so excited that I blow it. And I fall into a depression once again..and it's getting to the point where I'm apprehensive about trying anything because I feel like I'm going to fail at everything regardless of how carefully I plan.,Bipolar
50414,How bad does it have to be to be considered psychosis? I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.However I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were retrospectively pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100 unquestioningly and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway and then fought with all my family and friends about it.At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. I really was sick though but the level of paranoia was weird.I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant until recently I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.TLDR at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs being paranoid and having weird thoughts?I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff and I can't tell if for me it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first. I don't know how I feel about all of this.,Bipolar
47032,Lithium and mood stabilisation. Hey guys I have been diagnosed with bipolar affectivw disorder and put on lithium for 2 weeks no i'm on 500mg and it pretty much has no effect also on latudaantipsychotic 1 month 40mg and seroquel IR 3 months 200mg sleep. It almost feels like my hypomania can't be stopped with this combo. Wouldn't a significant amount of my dopamine be blocked at this point? How can I be constantly hypomanic for 6 days and be on lithium my friend tried 250mg and was FLOORED. He said he felt extremely dedated and drunk clurring his words etc and sleeping for like 1214 hours I'm lucky to get 7 hours sleep myself.. I understand i'm tolerant to seroquel and probably getting used to latuda but this is rediculous I've had serious arguments with rind coworkers and family due to my expansive mindset and irritabilityrages. usually at retards at work or stupid people in public Iwould like to believe its justified since theyre retards but even that sound slike a hypomanic thing to say. Anyway send your xperiences to this space I'm keen to get an idea of how other people xperience such combinations especially the lithium side of things thanks for taking the time to read this ,Bipolar
46157,crosspost from advice I'm at a crossroads with career due to mental illness I'm 26 I do tier 1amp2 tech support and other IT tasks at a decently sized fortune company. I've been diagnosed with bipolar for 6 years. Anxiety and previously depression for 15I've been having one of the worst depressed episodes in years. We're going on 5 months now. Typically when I have an episode and I'm working the either the collateral damage from the mania or stagnancy from the depression lead to me losing my job. But with this one I have short term disability insurance and FMLA so my job is protected. I'm at home thinking about what I want to do with my life and if the life I lead could be contributing to the stress I feel. I went to high school for writing and was a college drop out for film. I have a passion for the arts a talent for the science and an interest in a lot of other fields. And surmountable debt from my previous studies.Part of me knows the reasonable thing would be to go back to work but it feels like a big ol wall is blocking me.The tricky thing is that the disease makes you feel like moving and making changes and starting new projects and idk if thats what that really is. I could use some outside insightI'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to go back to school and apply for disabilityscholarshipsect or continue down the technology path.,Bipolar

Opened Reddit while contemplating how unhealthy cigarettes are as Im smoking first thing I read is a showerthought about how no other industry could survive after killing over 400 million people besides cigarettes. Was talking to my wife about how Ive been seeing multiples of 11 everywhere and she says someone gave me a book today and pulls out a book which has the subtitle the meaning of 111222333 and other number sequences I know this is a symptom and Im probably ramping up to being hypomanic but the cognitive difference between understanding that and my experience of actually seeing it and feeling like the universe is trying to tell me something is a real mind fuck.

50475,Do you also do this during hypomanic mixed? episodes? TLDR I'm bipolar type two with mixed features currently in a hypomanic mixed? episode.I experience some of these things clenched jaw 1015 minute panic attack that disappears in a few seconds leaving you confused but not feeling bad just very confused nightmares and night sweating completely forgetting to eat and losing the instinct of eating or liking food except shit like sweets cola coffee and chips with cigs ofcDo you?Note I'm like 95 sure I'm hypomanic right now and have been for almost a month but was in denial until a week ago seeing psychiatrist on Friday to talk. Anyway I'm experiencing these things and was wondering if anyone else had this clenched jaw most of the time random 1015 minute panic attackdark dissociation few times a week had one where i couldn't contain a scream that was just so guttural like I was giving birth and then started hyperventilating so hard I almost fainted and had to sit down and hold onto something to not fall but then all of a sudden you have a posotive thought and it disappearears in a second making you wonder what even happened and laughing at how dramatic you are nightmares or night sweating completely FORGETTING TO EAT like losing the instinct to eat even when I'm hungry I don't think about food but I think of resolving the problem so I stuff myself with the easiest fastest food that's kinda nutritious and idc about the taste like plain slices of protein bread Bananas I don't even like the texture or the taste of bananas but its the cleanest and most efficient for hunger vegan premade protein shakes in bottles over 2 months I've consumed about 100 of them I have one every morning and other shit meal mentioned above and SOMETIMES have the patience to boil a pack of ravioli that takes 3 minutes to cook and eat it just with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or airfry in 10 minutes a pack of vegan nuggets or fish sticks and eat them plain yup no sauce and not evem fried such a treat less dishes. Btw I'm also diagnosed with mixed episodes and I've experienced them but usually they are way darker and cold with a bit of psychotic moments and I just feel superior to others like an evil God and I'm full of rage.Whereas here I feel quite at peace but a bit out of control but I know that I'm gonna take care of it soon going back tomorrow to my parents. And overall I feel happy everyday and grateful and I feel like the world is so beautiful but I just have those breakdowns described above few times a week if not almost daily these days...Mmh yeah I talk a lot but that's a known hypimanic thing.

46156,possibly bipolar diagnose. Goodmorning people!Just a short introduction..For a long time now I've been experiencing symptoms such asIndecisive as F. I CHANGE MY MIND ALL THE TIME. I can't seem to relate to anything...It's really bad. I can't stay at a job as soon as I get an idea let's say traveling or doing something else I quit my job leave my apartment and the idea just slowly dies. Then I start aaaall over again finding a job a new place to stay new idea BAM. Same vicious circle.I have moodswings like crazy. Depressed periodsdays and not so depressed periodsdays.On my depressed periodsdays I Tend to isolate myself disable all my social media turn off my phone. I get irritable and angry about the smallest things for no reason. My creativityconfidence level goes to 0 so it's like i've never played on my guitar before or sung a song. And of course the overthinking everything like crazy it gets so bad that I can't even answer a simple yes or no question without having to overthink it. And I always know that as soon as I answer the question I wouldwill change my mind straight away.On my good daysperiods I get crazy.. hyper and active?Spend money on random stuffGet 1000 of ideas but never follow through with one of them.Confidence is SKY HIGH and I can do everything. I sleep 34 hours max and im good to go. Relationship wise I really quickly lose interest. All of a sudden I just cut off contact without letting the person Or i do the opposite and get way to clingy and deep. So yesterday I've simply had enough. I went to the doctor told him all this and he referred my to a psychiatrist which I will be seeing in 45 weeks... He couldn't tell me 100 what it was and im just clueless on what to do.

45763,My schools disability resources is being a butt and I dont have the energy to self advocate After a decade of dealing with mental health professionals Ive learned how to be my own self advocate. There were times when I felt my pdoc was dismissive and I had to stand up for myself to make myself heard. It can be so hard because in the end theyre usually just trying to help and I feel bad for being almost confrontational. Ive learned what situations you should badger an office and when you shouldnt. This is the shit you learn when you deal with this bullshit disease. And I need to badger my schools DR right now. For some reason they havent granted me excused absences which I had no issue getting at previous institutions and those are so much more important than getting extended testing time...And I know how it looks. I KNOW. It looks like I want a legitimate way to slack off but that isnt what happens. I did my best to not abuse those previous accommodations because they were my saving grace at the end of the semester. Im not completely incompetent. I can follow the syllabus text classmates and do my best to keep up with the class materials. But sometimes I just cannot leave my bed.So much has gone wrong this past month. Life has just taken a huge shit on me at the beginning of this semester and I need help. I have an established relationship with a psychiatrist in this new town but I need a therapist. She gave me a list and Ive been playing phone tag with her top recommendation and I just cant anymore. I dont have the energy. Im here by myself away from family freaked out by my creepy neighbors and just struggling in general. The only two things I can focus on are my schoolwork and taking care of my dog. And everyday I feel like Im failing at even that. My house is a mess. Im a mess. My eating habits are horrible. I feel the temptation of hard alcohol everyday... so I binge eat then starve then binge. Luckily my alcohol consumption hasnt gotten out of control tho I am planning on cutting it out completely again. I thought discussion questions were due at midnight on Sundays but theyre due at 8 pm. I had confused between two different classs deadlines. My prof has been so understanding but god I need to show Im not trying take advantage of any slack she has given me. Shes been so great at balancing having compassion but not coddling me. I really like her. And Im just asking for this one thing from my school. Their department is a fucking mess. My psychiatrist had dealt with them before and said she needs to be contacted by them first before writing any sort of letters detailing why I need this accommodation. I told this to the DR but they insisted that wasnt the case. So I call my psychiatrist and she insisted that thats how its always been and wont write anything until shes contacted by them. Then my assigned counselor sent me a passive aggressive email that the recommendation I had sent in did not explain why I needed an ESA. Shit lady I was not asking for a fucking emotional support animal! Get your fucking shit together. Family connections can be great tho my mother works at the university and knows the chair or director or what fucking ever of the DR and insists that I call him and go over the counselors head. But god I just do not have the energy. I dont have the energy for any of this. Sometimes I wish I was still a minor so my mom could just make my appts for me. For the first time in years I just want my mom to take care of me like she used to. I dont want to be responsible for dealing with this shit. Im being kept awake by my racing heart rate being brought on by my anxiety. Im all out of clonazepam until at least Wednesday. I had two beers left over and self medicated just to calm down a little but when I lay my head down all I can hear is my racing heart. I need help. I know how to ask for it. Where to find it. But god I just dont have the energy... The short days are even harder to deal with here due to the fucking freezing temperatures. Everything is so much harder when its this cold. Im just in this stupid self pity party where Im just asking why me???? Im really sorry for the length. I just dont have anywhere to turn right now. ,Bipolar
45476,I think the police are coming Last night I took my normal medication and vitamins for Bipolar I. Then I started the shower on 100 hot. I pulled out. Few other medications just 2ish doses and took them. I just wanted to see what it could feel like. I showered nice and hot I'm a girl so the fires of hell would be comfortable lol then laid down and listens to my playlist. The steamy bathroom and songs I love felt good.My husband woke up at 1am to use the restroom and asked me' what the hell are you doing? Then moved on. I have been hiding this for so long. Thinking and planning and trying to figure things out. On my way to work he told me to drop my attitude and I lost it and told him everything. Everything I've kept secret for 9 months. I told him my final plan and what I'd done.He told me to go home or he'd call the police to my work. So I kept on going to work. He's not my master. But I don't want them to take me. I have a degree in psychology and this isn't my first or fifth run of this. I know what to say to stay out. But this is the first time a family member has called. I don't want to go. It won't help or change how I feel. I have an amazing therapist psychiatrist and Dr. I'm not emotional or desperate. I just don't want to try every day like this. Trying to look and act normal and happy. Yesterday my husband and mother in law told me I'm doing a shit job covering it. So what's the point anyways? I can't hide it. No one wants to hear it. I told my husband I want his support but the only thing he will say is he is calling the police. So maybe they are coming maybe not. ,Bipolar

Like sorry Im not paying my bill right now Im out buying shit that will entertain this manic episode for maybe 7 whole days! Sorry I missed a payment I didnt really care to view the statement right now because Im out living life. No I have no idea if those charges are fraudulent I was living in the moment.

49654,How to explain what BD is like? Hi friends! Sorry if this is the wrong place to post.I 20F was diagnosed with BD2 back around October so still fairly recent. I am super lucky to have a family that encourages me to keep going to therapy and stay on medication however Im finding they dont really understand what Im going through.While Im aware theres no real way for them to conceptualize what is actually happening to me during hypo episodes more specifically was misdiagnosed w depression at 17 depression I feel is a little easier understood Id like to be able to have them be aware of what an episode is like. I cant exactly put it all into words when trying to explain it to them myself and I often feel like doing that ends up scaringworrying them more. So Im looking for a resource that can detail what hypomania is really like whether that be a daytoday kind of thing or just an extensive list of symptoms. Most recently I spent several days awake and have had obvious weight loss which led my dad to ask my older brother if he thought I had been getting into methcoke as my dad was previously addicted to meth and experienced similar symptoms.Thanks to all who took the time to read this!,Bipolar
46832,Wellbutrin making me suicidal? I am a bipolar 18 year old and I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 11 but until a few months ago i was thought to just have severe unipolar depression. I went on 300mg of Effexor which worked wonders for my depression but made me extremely manic. I went off of it and was on nothing for a month after the initial Effexor withdrawal which is not fun. Last week I got put on 150mg of Wellbutrin bupropion and 12.5mg of lamictal although Im eventually gonna increase to 25mg and ever since the first day of starting this my suicidal thoughts have been through the roof. Im still waiting it out to see if things will get better but I keep getting worse every day. I cant tell if its the medicine or just my life thats making me feel this way since its been pretty awful lately I have absolutely no friends at all my dad is dying I may have a permanent STD I get harassed by men almost on a daily basis I either get terrible nightmares and sleep paralysis every night or I just dont sleep I cant leave my dorm without getting extremely irritated by everyone because I cant stand noise Im always in constant fear that Im gonna gain weight and more. Im scared to switch medications because 1 Im tired of them just making me worse and 2 I know a lot of antidepressants especially the ones used to treat bipolar cause weight gain and I absolutely cannot have that because I know it sounds stupid and shallow but Im conventionally attractive and thin and thats literally the only thing that brings me comfort and keeps me going. Should I just stay on Wellbutrin and wait it out?,Bipolar
49647,Forgetting episodes Does anyone else have holes in their memory from specific hypomania andor depressive episodes.

46204,Grieving what my life could have been It's been about a year since I was diagnosed type 2 and my therapist says I'm still in denial that I actually have bipolar disorder. I guess she's right. In a way I guess I'm grieving over what I thought my life could've been stable connected to others and successful. I'm stuck in a mindset where I feel like my symptoms are only in my head and if I stop taking my meds and going to therapy everything will go back to normalno more suicidal thoughtsattempts and hypomania. Yet if roles were reversed and a friend were telling me this I'd tell them to keep taking their meds and going to therapy and move on with their life. I know this is just whining but to be honest I just don't want to have bipolar disorder. I've realized how serious bipolar disorder is and I don't want to deal with the stigma and the risksuncertainty and the work involved. I don't want to keep having to disclose this loved ones. I don't want the decreased lifespan from being likely to commit suicide. I don't want the reckless decisions that come with mania and mixed states. I don't want any of this.Has anyone else experienced these feelings? How do I accept my condition so I can move on with my life?,Bipolar
46755,Hanging isnt painful like they think anyone hung themselves remember the experience? All I remember is the act of it and being resuscitated. The just before and as I started to regain consciousness and came to the realisation I wasnt dead... they were shouting my name but I didnt quite hear them at first. Honestly thought I was entering the afterlife for a short while. Anyone else have a different experience surviving this type of suicide attempt? I also have decided it might be time to try again. I dont want to repeat past mistakes but I also this time want it to look like it wasnt intentional. If I died in a tragic accident the people who think they love me could accept that more than if I died intentionally. ,Bipolar

46509,Evidence for high TSHlow thyroid causing rapid cycling mania? I was recently diagnosed with unipolar maniabipolar NOS after having a ton of hypomanic episodes over the past three years started out as 12 a year but over the last six months I've had at least one a month each lasting up to 10 days.I just started lithium so I had my bloodwork pulled and my TSH showed up with a result of 2.78 mIUL. My psychiatrist looked at that result and said that we need to get it below 2 and that she thought my high TSH was the reason I was rapid cycling.She wants to get me on a synthetic thyroid and I'm skeptical. 2.78 mIUL seems to be within healthy reference ranges though it is on the high side and I can't find any evidence that higher TSH values cause rapid cycling for mania. I've found evidence that taking synthetic thyroid was effective in preventing rapid cycling with people with depressionhttpspsycheducation.orgtreatmentthyroidandbipolardisorderhighdosethyroidhormoneasamoodstabilizerinbipolardisorder but it doesn't mention mania. Anyone have experience with this? I'd rather not take more medication if I don't have to.,Bipolar

I kept looking at the license plates of cars passing by and they all called to me in some way or another. I can't explain it but they all seemed to have special numbers related between them. I started writing them down and when I got home I analized them and I have the feeling they're all connected and they've all got something about them individually.

45566,Getting bf committed How realistic is this? He's been unmedicated for 2 years and promised a month ago he'd get medicated because I said I won't stay if he doesn't it's been bad.He is currently out of work for going on 8mos and obviously also uninsured. He went to a psych on his sister's bill about 5mos ago was prescribed Abilify did not like the initial side effects so refuses to take it. I can't afford to send him to a new pdoc and a lot of his family is not speaking to him rn because along with losing his job her burned most of his bridges.How realistic is it that we could get him committed and maybe get a new prescription that way? Is this a horrible idea? Will it make him worse? I have not proposed it yet but his counselor did about a month ago. Please help wonderful people of this amazing community. EDIT not wanting to commit him involuntarily. I just want to understand how hospitals or inpatient treatment centers work in situations like this. How does one get medshelp with limited funds is probably more the question. I'm sorry for being such a noob.,Bipolar
50057,My mania just ended and I think im going to spiral soon I 25f started my new job while I was manic and I made so many friends and I felt happy but then the monthish after I realized I was manic. I was drinking every day. I was.. a lot. But they loved it I think. I was fun. I was energy.Now I'm on the other side and the timing feels bad. I don't want people to start hating me again. It's not like they actually understand what bipolar is. I want to be more than who I am when im manic but I feel most myself and useful when I am. I've tried talking to 7 psychiatrists now and 4 or 5 therapists. One who specialized in cptsd and bipolar who was also a colored woman I was so excited about she ghosted me. I don't want to recant my traumas anymore. I can't handle it. I feel like I'm in a whirl pool but I can't tell if it will pull me under or just keep spinning me and spinning me. Boats are passing by but im not drowning so why stop?I just need some kind words from people who hear me and not just listen and tell me to wait. I don't know what to do lol,Bipolar
46436,I'm in love for the first time since diagnosis and it does not feel good. Yesterday I've put my best friend on a hold. Totally my fault. She were there for me the whole time but things worked out in a way that I developed a crush on her. I really thought wtf mania. Again?. But I had my lithium tests talked to my psychiatrist and sadly I wasn't manic at all. I was really suffering because she has her problems too and when I try to talk with her about it she doesn't respond well. I tried do keep my distance try to get over it but she likes me a lot and we became even closer. Relationships are a huge problem for me and my friend is in a different phase of life. She broke with her first boyfriend recently they were together from age 13 till 18 church boyfriend holding hands only she was unhappy and now she is dating a lot of guys no strings attached a lot like what I do but it hurts for me to see it. I started avoiding being at the same places she goes to and the others close to me are telling me she is not really all that. So I decided to put our friendship on a hold too since I'm unhappy with this let's speed date everyone we can and maybe we'll get together at the end. I can't keep having sex and making out with strangers to compensate her actions you know? It became toxic. Yesterday we've had a huge fight about it because I told her I didn't like to be exposed this way. Edit 1 She thought I called her a whore idk but things went ugly and she told me that I was the one she liked. It doesn't matter because it was turning my first time being ok with my disorder in making me feel like a mess.

If it wasn't for the reminder of taking my meds I probably would have forgot I even have it by now. But right now I am having an issue with a boss at work and it is really throwing me for a tail spin. At least before when I had crazy anxiety I was used to it but given how stable I've been the last few years it's SO overwhelming. It's a tough situation without a possible solution at the moment I'm basically just caught in the crossfire of my two bosses fighting with each other and it's so tense and uncomfortable here that I feel totally out of control.

Were currently about 2 weeks from the end of winter break and I'm going to run out of my lamictal tomorrow. For some reason the pharmacy said im not able to refill my prescription without a confirmation from my doc.

47038,Prescribed Lamictal but I haven't been diagnosed as Bipolar. I'm wondering if this is normal. I have done extensive research and I am 100 sure I don't have any of the various types of bipolar disorder. I have never had a manic episode and most of the symptoms I've read about have not occurred to me. I would really appreciate some advice or anecdotes regarding those who were put on Lamictal but do not have a bipolar diagnosis. I have been on various depression medications over the course of 15 years and till trying to find medications that work for me. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder including Panic Disorder Depression and PTSD. Every day I experience depression for most of the day and lately my baseline of anxiety is high all the time and at times has spiked so high that I have had mood swings which is very uncommon for me. But the thing is my mood swings from being depressed to being angry irritated or just so unhappy and overwhelmed that I cry. Not happy or excitable. The medications I'm on are Gabapentin prescribed for a chronic pain disorder not depression Wellbutrin amp Buspar I am convinced the Buspar is not doing enough for my anxiety but this week my doc increased my dose to 3 times a day to give it one last shot. Then he said he wanted to add Lamictal into my daily routine because it would help with my mood swings. He didn't really explain much more than that. I told him I didn't feel like the mood swings were my problem because they are being caused by my anxiety which is not being controlled.Does this story sound familiar to anyone? Should I lose my skepticism and just give Lamictal a shot? Does my doctor think I have bipolar depression and isn't telling me? This post is in no way meant to avoid a true diagnosis from my doctor.Side note I fully respect and empathize with those that have bipolar disorder especially due to my exposure to the podcast Jen Gotch is Okay...Sometimes I am a big fan of her creative endeavors through Ban.do and other projects so I gave it a listen and highly recommend. She is trying to erase the stigma of bipolar and explains her bipolar disorder to reach out to those who either don't understand the disorder or to those who are experiencing something similar.,Bipolar

49738,I was wondering if you also find it impossible to make difficult decisions? I've been pondering the question of what's next for almost 2 years now and I can't make the decision. The country where I now live was always a temporary destination but due to covid I was forced to stay longer than expected. Now I feel like I'm stuck here. It's been 4 years here 2 years longer than anticipated and I don't know what to do. Whatever choice I make it's a big life choice that due to my financial situation locks me in to that choice for a few years. Simply said I don't trust my decisions. When I finally pin something down I ask myself is this decision made by a sane mind or am I in some state of either mania or depression. But because it's so difficult to figure out I end up doing nothing. This has been going on for 2 years now and I'm not sure what to do. Do you have any experience with this and how do you make big decisions? Is there a way to minimise the risks of a bad decision because of the disease?,Bipolar
46812,Trying to understand my exgirlfriend better. Hey I don't know if these type of questions are allowed on this subreddit but I figured the best way to understand someone who is living with a bipolar disorder is to ask people who live with a bipolar disorder.I met my exgirlfriend when we were younger. We became best friends and I saved her life 2 times when she tried to commit suicide. Because of this I always thought that we have a really deep connection. However we only started dating 3 years after knowing each other. I was 18 she was 20. We dated for 2 years and our relationship was beautiful but also exhausting from time to time. Constant suicide thoughts because of the slightest issues and also a shitty behaviour that she showed from time to time including insulting manipulating and blackmailing me. She also had depressions social anxiety schizophrenia and I think borderline. So it's hard to distinguish why she behaved like she did.However after 2 years of dating her best friend and 2 other friends came back in her life. She suddenly lost ALL interest in me. That's what I personally think is because of borderline since they always need 1 favourite person in life and can't have 2 at the same time.But what really surprises me and what can't really be explained with any of the other things is that she really.. changed. A lot. And quickly. We always used to play videogames watch movies go for a walk in the park or woods. And then when her best friend came back in to her life she changed completely. She was suddenly going partying drinking alcohol every day she also seemed to have lost every other mental illness she had. No signs of depression anymore no signs of social anxiety anymore. She was suddenly like one of the girls of these clichee american student movies that only drink alcohol and party and just enjoy their live without any fear of repercussions. And then she broke up. She had no sense of any guilt anymore. Cancelled a date with me to go out with another guy broke up over whatsapp 30 minutes later she came by with another guy to pick up her stuff. When I talked to her mother her mother cried and told me that her daughter just said I have to go own my way now. the whole time and that they her parents also worry about her and don't know what is happening. Apparently she also wasn't home at that point for 1 week anymore. She is also not using any social media platform anymore or is playing any video games anymore which was basically her whole life before that.I first thought this was because of borderline too so I asked people with borderline about it and they said that even they would never do anything like that. So my last hope before I have to accept that she just wasn't a good human is to ask you guys. Could all of this be explained because of her bipolar disorder ? Like a manic episode ?,Bipolar
46521,Does anyone else try to stay home and isolate because it's easier? I prefer to be alone and will avoid social interaction as much as possible. I'm really good at acting like a fun carefree person and because I rant become overactive when manic people assume that I love to hang out and I have a lot of friends which I wish I didn't in all honesty because upkeep is really stressful in reality I hate going out with friends at night now and I'm just not interested in anyone's conversation about their mundane work lives or rocky relationships etc. I do have a few friends I love to talk to and be around but generally I would rather keep myself away from everyone for fear of being triggered into depression or doing saying something I shouldn't when manic. I have a lot of hobbies that require me being alone writing drawing film etc and sometimes I even get flulike symptoms when getting worked up about having to go to a bar or concert and stay home sick. People must think I'm the most I'll person in the world at this point.Does anyone else have this experience ? ,Bipolar

Ill go from manic to depressive in a few hours. Im currently what I call stable on 200mgs of lamictal but Im terrified of what may happen after I give birth. I know PPD with psychosis is higher risk in bipolar moms and Im scared because I want my baby more than Ive ever wanted anything and the thought of losing her or causing her harm scares me. Did anyone here either deal with PP psychosis or not have any issues at all after delivery?

45398,Hypersexuality I was diagnosed with bipolar unspecified at 13 and I'm a young adult now. I didn't actually find out about my diagnosis until last year because my parents worked really hard to conceal it from me. The most recent discovery has been learning that believe it or not I wasn't just a normal horny teenage boy. I have nearly crippling hypersexuality as a cute little side effect of my bipolar. I don't really want to turn this into a nsfw thread unless it can't be helped but how do you ever cope with this? I'm a severe pornography addict to the point where I can't function if I don't get my daily fix I have painful shaking fits and the like. It's been like this since I was 11.

45620,WarningIs this a Manic Episode? Please HELP xpost rbipolar I've been diagnosed with bipolar by three different psychiatrists. I kept asking for different opinions because I thought I was simply afflicted with major depression on and off for about a decade!.I've finally accepted the diagnosis and started the treatment but the pills that the doctor prescribed are exclusively to treat symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disease Lamictal. For the past 5 days however I've been experiencing something very different Some of my thoughts seem foreign to me in the sense that I know they don't make sense but I am still drawn toconsumed by them. I do and say things that are completely outrageous. Even though I am perfectly aware that they are outrageous I somehow can't stop myself. It's very easy to trigger my irritability. I am screaming loudly and aggressively and using profanity at the slightest of provocations. I am vicariously living some fantasies. When I say vicariously I mean that I am having extreme reactions of nostalgia over things that never happened fake memories. It's strange in the sense that I know they are fake but at the same time I believe them?My head is a big mess. I don't have any answers. When I'm depressed none of this happens. Right now I feel like I have more than one person inside my head. There is the rational side the side that is aware that something is off the side that is writing this. And then there is the unbalanced side the side that is causing all this havoc.The only thing that seems to help is to go clubbing or to a place with a lot of noise. It somehow makes my thoughts more clear and leaves me more relaxed even without the help of alcohol.Has anyone experienced any of these things? I am scared but I end up driving away everyone that tries to offer their help. ,Bipolar

49844,Just need to vent Sorry this post is a huge mess. I just need to let everything out and I don't know who to go to right now who would understand my situation. So I'm 17 got diagnosed on my birthday quick fun fact I guess lol and moved out of my parent's into an entirely different state back in January. I was doing completely fine and actually felt on top of the world for awhile. I did some exams that allowed me to graduate early before moving told myself and everyone I'll get a new job and start college as soon as I can. I haven't been able to get a job here yet so I have been doing commissions to hold me off for a while. I was doing really good with that making about 80200 a week which held me off pretty well I'm living with my boyfriend who lives with his mom so I don't have to pay rent or anything just need to buy stuff for myself and my cat everything was going good. I had to stop my meds after I moved because my psychiatrist isn't licensed in this state plus the side effects for the meds I was currently on gave me really bad tardive dyskinesia. My boyfriend's mom has been pressuring me more and more recently to get a job sending me links for places to apply to more and I've been applying to them. The other night I had a conversation with my parents I'm still on good terms with them and my mom noticed I must be manic because I told her I've been unable to get much sleep at all due to my mind constantly racing. She said she wants me to come visit home asap because she has bipolar too and based on her experience she doesn't want me being unmedicated and manic in an entirely different state especially when the depression comes. I told my boyfriend's mom this and she was really disappointed saying that she doesn't want me to constantly visit back and forth again before I moved I would visit for a couple weeks very often and that I'm supposed to have a job by now and that basically if I'm going to be doing this I should just move back until Im 18. I seriously don't want to move back though. I love my parents and everything and I want to just visit not move back entirely. I'm happier here with my boyfriend finally have myself settled and comfortable here and I'm worried if I move back I'll get addicted to bad habits again because my mental health was a lot worse there. My parents and my boyfriend's mom had a whole dispute and I was in the middle of it and since then I just feel like it triggered something in me and now I feel miserable and sick and scared. I'm sleeping constantly and when I wake up I have messages from my boyfriend's mom telling me to apply to some place along with messages from my parents asking when I'll be visiting. I don't want to disappoint or upset either of them with what I do and I don't know what'll be best for me staying here and getting a job or risking it and going back to get my mental health worked on. I haven't been able to draw much at all since then and I fell behind on my commissions which is making me feel worse and I just don't know what to do right now. I feel stuck and I just want to cry and sleep and ignore all these issues. I haven't felt this shitty in so long I can't bring myself to do anything and I keep suddenly crying several times a day when I'm awake.Sorry if this issue seems trivial or anything. I just have an extreme fear of disappointing people which makes this all so much worse for me. I really want to visit my parents and get on something that'll help me but I'm worried that if I go my boyfriend's mom won't allow me to come back and I don't want to upset her with my decision since she keeps telling me to apply to the places she's sending me and I'm telling her I will so she won't get upset.I don't know what I want from this post. I just know I needed to let this all out. If anyone reads this all then personal input or advice is welcome. I'm not sure what to do right now I need to make a decision quick but I can't bring myself to,Bipolar

Ive been sick I was 19 and Im still only 31 Im stuck in bed and barley able to walk everyday . Im in constant pain. Not looking for sympathy or anything I just need to vent. I guess its hard for me to talk about on the Internet to complete strangers even though reading on Reddit is a great comfort to me. I cant drive anymore. I need help with everything. I have to depend on my family for everything Im lucky that I have them and that I do have least with my mom as a support system. Though I dont have anybody to help me right now so Im gonna have to run out and get my medication I have no idea how Im going to do that Im trying to find a ride right now because Im out of my medication. Im feeling so down that I just cant motivate myself to leave. Where I live its freezing cold its dark and gloomy. I dont have any friends where I live I have no social life because Im in constant suffering constant pain . Everything causes pain. So I know when I leave the house because I have no choice Im going to be in so much more pain. I guess thats one of the main reasons besides being depressed that its so hard for me. I guess I just need to vent thanks for listening. Im usually more on depressed Spectrum then manic. Hang in there I take some comfort in knowing that all of us are true warriors. I hope this makes sense Im a little scatterbrained and very tired I didnt get much sleep last night I never sleep well. And again thank you listening Id love to return the favor. ,Bipolar
46351,Does your depression start similar to this Hi all so I think I have been misdiagnosed as just depression. I have a serious question can you be basically feeling okay and just one thing starts the downward spiral? I was good over the holidays and then my daughter canceled our New Years Days plansit seriously started me on a suicidal depression. Then I somehow pulled myself out and three days ago my son got annoyed with me asking him if he knew where his brother was...no fight or anythingjust annoyance in his answer to me. Then I went down again this time is worse. Actually have wondered about hospitalization. The ONLY THING I am functioning at is my jobcause I have to. If BP is chemical is it impossible to be set off by one little thing? Thanks ahead for your answers.,Bipolar
49661,Do you also do this during hypomanic mixed? episodes? TLDR I'm bipolar type two with mixed features currently in a hypomanic mixed? episode.I experience some of these things clenched jaw 1015 minute panic attack that disappears in a few seconds leaving you confused but not feeling bad just very confused nightmares and night sweating completely forgetting to eat and losing the instinct of eating or liking food except shit like sweets cola coffee and chips with cigs ofcDo you?Note I'm like 95 sure I'm hypomanic right now and have been for almost a month but was in denial until a week ago seeing psychiatrist on Friday to talk. Anyway I'm experiencing these things and was wondering if anyone else had this clenched jaw most of the time random 1015 minute panic attackdark dissociation few times a week had one where i couldn't contain a scream that was just so guttural like I was giving birth and then started hyperventilating so hard I almost fainted and had to sit down and hold onto something to not fall but then all of a sudden you have a posotive thought and it disappearears in a second making you wonder what even happened and laughing at how dramatic you are nightmares or night sweating completely FORGETTING TO EAT like losing the instinct to eat even when I'm hungry I don't think about food but I think of resolving the problem so I stuff myself with the easiest fastest food that's kinda nutritious and idc about the taste like plain slices of protein bread Bananas I don't even like the texture or the taste of bananas but its the cleanest and most efficient for hunger vegan premade protein shakes in bottles over 2 months I've consumed about 100 of them I have one every morning and other shit meal mentioned above and SOMETIMES have the patience to boil a pack of ravioli that takes 3 minutes to cook and eat it just with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or airfry in 10 minutes a pack of vegan nuggets or fish sticks and eat them plain yup no sauce and not evem fried such a treat less dishes. Btw I'm also diagnosed with mixed episodes and I've experienced them but usually they are way darker and cold with a bit of psychotic moments and I just feel superior to others like an evil God and I'm full of rage.Whereas here I feel quite at peace but a bit out of control but I know that I'm gonna take care of it soon going back tomorrow to my parents. And overall I feel happy everyday and grateful and I feel like the world is so beautiful but I just have those breakdowns described above few times a week if not almost daily these days...Mmh yeah I talk a lot but that's a known hypimanic thing. Thank you for reading if you did and have a good insert what it is for you ! ,Bipolar

46286,I failed the IB diploma. I don't want to try anymore. BD1 It's 1229 AM here. I'm so tired of trying. I tried in the IBDP and scored 2445 points and didn't receive my diploma. My attendance was 38 and I was in a psych ward for most of the time I wasn't there. I don't want to repeat senior year because I'm so burnt out I just don't have another senior year in me. I can't go to university because I have no ATAR. I'm applying for a remark but I was three points away from passing my HL subjects so I doubt it'll do much. I can do a diploma at a university and go onto a degree in 2020 but I know it's going to tear me apart seeing my friends doing real degrees. My dream was to study in the US. I got an ACT score of 30. I was going to go there for real! I was so excited and proud of myself when I got that score!Now I want to go back in time and slap that stupid smile off my stupid face. I was never going to make it. I was stupid to think that I could. I have had anorexia nervosa since I was eleven years old. My BMI is around 13. Every time I move my head I can feel my blood pressure doing some weird shit. I've had disordered tendencies since I was six. I do not remember a time when I was at peace with myself. I don't think I'll ever get better. I've tried so many times to heal. I'm on meds. I don't want to give up hope. There's a small part of me that wants to keep going. I really do want to be able to do a degree someday move out of home maybe even find love. God I'm so lonely. I have friends sure. But I want to experience love. It seems like it's useless to pursue that 90 of relationships involving an individual with bipolar end in divorce. I imagine that this is higher for those with BD1. But I have so much love to give. I was in a relationship until a few weeks ago but she was emotionally abusive. I can never get better and find love because my body is disgusting. I'm very short 5'6 and female. I'm the shortest in my family by four inches. I'm around 36 kilograms and I only look normal. I once weight restored to the still unhealthy for my height 46kg and I was hideous. I looked overweight. I can never get better from my ED if I ever want anyone to love me. I don't know. Just a little rant. I'm tired of trying to get better when it seems like there is no hope for me. Just this past week I had 7 straight days of eating over 2000 calories. This was a big deal for me. I really thought I could get better. But today I freaked out and ate nothing because I saw how fat I had gotten in only one week. I need advice. What do I even do? My new psychiatrist doesn't think I'm sick enough to see me more than once every three weeks. My old one went to jail but he cared and he saw me once a week. He went under for getting caught cooking morphine but he was always lovely to me and genuinely cared. This one doesn't really think I'm sick enough to be seen more often. Although if I ask I will probably be able to go inpatient in the private hospital she works at. A friend of mine also BD1 went IP there and found it very helpful but he's much older than me and I don't know what it was like in his ward as I was down the hall in the eating disorder program. Which I was kicked out of after four days had panic attack and lit a cigarette in my room.So. What should I do about treatment? I have the option to go for BD or my anorexia but I don't do well with other anorexics around as they trigger me. I also have all the group thought experimentsexercisesnot sure how to call them from the eating disorder unit as I got friends who've stayed there to send them to me. In theory I could complete them in my own time if I were to go for BD and stay in that ward instead of the eating disorder ward. However I do think that some of the things I didn't experience during my time in that ward takeaway nights eating in public challenges etc may have really helped me. So I'm fairly certain I will go inpatient but not sure which ward to go to. Also what should I do about my education? Should I just try to get over myself and do a diploma here then review my options for university be that domestic or abroad when that's finished or wait and see what happens with the remark or resit my exams? This got long I'm sorry. I skipped meds yesterday morning and last night. But I just really need some help. I'm so tired.,Bipolar
50133,Hallucinations My hallucinations are far and few. When they happen it scares the shit out of me. How many of you experience them? Mine are mainly auditory. If I'm in a paranoid state I see figures in the corner of my eye but as soon as I turn no one is there. I've had one physical one a few years ago. I was driving and I felt someone grip my left shoulder. The only one in the car was my sleeping toddler strapped in his carseat. Tonight I thought I saw a blanket on my couch move and I heard specifically clear as day my fb messenger ding four times. Checked them nothing. No spam no requests no calls. I'm petrified of this getting worse. They only seem to flare up when I'm under intense stress.,Bipolar

49633,What am I doing with my life. I guess you could say Ive done a lot in my lifetime but I feel like Ive just failed a lot. Before I was diagnosed I was on the fast track to be a lawyer at 22. That didnt happen and now I am divorced and jobless with a useless bachelors degree. I cant take classes at my community college because I cant afford them. I cant take university classes because Ive dropped classes so many times they wont give me financial aid. I have terrible credit and I am deep in credit card personal and student loan debt. I try getting jobs but dont stay at them for more than a few months. I just cant bring myself to do things I dont want to do. Even if its something I need to do to survive I will still just quit. Thats why Im in such a bad spot. I dont know what to do with my life. People say just get a flexible parttime job doing easy stuff but if I dont enjoy it I will literally quit two months in. My parents have been supporting me my entire life even when I was married my ex was a loser. I feel so bad for them to have this failure of a child. Im not eligible for disability because I havent worked enough hours and I'm not eligible for SSI because my parents provide me with everything. Not that I could live off of either of those anyways. Im so frustrated with myself. I'm not sure if I have any hopes or dreams left. I dont know if I need advice or just to vent but here I am.,Bipolar

46815,Neuroscience of bipolar I am a total hopless nerd. What helps me probably the most with bipolar besides meds duh is understanding what the medications actually do. I have binders full of detailed notes I take on different classes of psychopharmaceuticals Its so fascinating how people with different brain chemistries react so differently to various meds!. For some reason the chemical perspective helps me understand it all SO much better. It also helps to explain it to normies I've found! And with work I've done on emotional awareness it feels like I can tell when something is emotional versus caused by brain chemicals Of course there is overlap.After things like exercise sex caffeine anything that gets them neurotransmitters moving I feel hyper aware of my chemical state. I can feel the the fall and the rise. ...it's just when I let my chemicals get so off balance that I get manic or depressed and then this logical view is fucked. Lol.This was kind of random but it consumes a lot of my thoughts! Are there any other bipolar science nerds out there? Any thoughts? Or do you have certain scientific perspectives that help you understand this illness?,Bipolar
46188,Things dont feel quite real. I sometimes get into these fogs of feeling like my life isnt mine or that its all not real. I have a cold and my partner just handed me Nyquil to take before bed it felt like the pills crumbled or disintegrated in my hands for a split second Ive seenfelt this before in the car when I look at building or the road sometimes for a split second it looks like the buildings or the the world around me crumblesdisintegrates kind of like the movie Inception if that make sense. Ive been in a mixed episode for almost 5 months and keep get snip bits of this feeling. Last year my sister in law essentially took my personal experiences having Bipolar and claiming it as their own experience observed from their many behaviors this person shows symptoms of BPD and factitious disorder this kind of fucked with my head a bit. I am someone who constantly tries to make themselves feel guilty I obsess and try to convince myself my problems arent as bad as they seem because I dont want to come off as pretentious or as a victim recently I shared with extended in laws that I have bipolar in the context of the conversation we were having one of them was a social worker and I had a lovely conservation with her about it that made me feel open and comfortable. However in sharing this I feel like I am coming off as though Im victimizing myself or trying to gain sympathyeven though that wasnt my intention. This is making me feel like my experiences arent real and that Im just pretending to even though I know what my life has been from my memories but I keep questioning if they are real? I keep questioning if anything is real. And Im kind of terrified. It isnt that extreme but maybe it will get worse I dont know Im very confused... anyone ever experience this?,Bipolar
50006,Bipolar and bpd diagnosis I know there's a chance somone can be bipolar and have borderline personality disorder. Was it difficult for someone who has both bipolar and bpd disorder to get diagnosed? I know some symptoms overlap but from what I know what helps bipolar be diagnosed officially is the clear cut mood swings correct me if I'm wrong and I assume bpd effects those manic and depressive episodes. Let me know ur experience,Bipolar

46272,Why does Seroquil sometimes cause hallucinations when it is also meant to suppress them? Just increased dose and I'm starting to get auditory and slight visual hallucinations. I don't have schizophrenia though I take 300mg seroquel and 200mg lamotragine for bipolar II. It's not that bad though the worst side effect I get is congested sinuses and the odd dizzy spell. It does seem to work well for what it's supposed to do otherwise. Anyone else experience these?,Bipolar
14490,sometimes i feel SO lonely and sad and i want to talk to someone but at the same time i cannot bring myself to do it. its like its just too much effort? i cannot handle people telling me their problems and idk if that makes me a bad person but i do not even know how to deal with my own problems so how am i supposed to offer advice to someone else?? i have one really good online friend and we have barely gone a day without talking for over 4 years but sometimes i just do not want to talk to her. its not her fault and i feel really bad when i ignore her for hours but it just REALLY overwhelms me sometimes. its like i desperately do not want to be alone but also i do lol. side note i think my depression and anxiety have gotten worse since covid and i find myself getting overwhelmed by the dumbest and simplest things. does that happen to anyone else? i want to talk to people but i cannot,Depression

8484,Recently my boyfriends ex threatened suicide and the wave of emotions that washed over me was almost too much. I grew up in a very abusive household where my sister and I were both physically beat and emotionally abused. I had the added bonus of being sexually abused. From a very young age we learned to fear our father and his moods. I can recall my mom attempting suicide multiple times when I was growing up. I can vividly remember seeing her in the shower with her clothes still on and my dad trying to get her to throw up.Ill never forget the nights my sister had to spend in the hospital after her attempt she came very close to succeeding. My attempt was much more low key but it was there. Thank god my best friend told a school counselor he literally saved my life. Of course therapy was never an option we had to maintain the appearance of a happy family no one could know what went on behind closed doors. I am not sure where I am going with this. All these images and memories keep popping up in my head. I thought I had dealt with the trauma that was my younger years already. I guess my therapist and I still have work to do. All the women in my family have attempted suicide,Depression
25685,Its strange it seems like I am always either hyper aware of my existence or I feel like I do not exist at all and I am simple observing everyone else. I have felt this way for a long time but the whole feeling like I do not exist thing is starting to impact me more and more. I cannot motivate myself to do anything when it does not even feel like I am real. The feeling is so genuine that I cannot even say that I know it sounds crazy. That being said I still cannot bring myself to tell anyone in my life that I feel this way. As much as it make sense to me no one around me will get it. It would just freak them out. Does anyone else feel this way? What would be a good way to potentially bring this up to someone? I do not have a clue how I would even start that convo. I feel like I do not exist,Depression

Does anyone have tips or techniques for pulling up your moodactivity levels when coming out of a spiral? Maybe this is too vague and freaky I just need to put out there that this happened and I fully was on a spiral. So weird that a mental health crisis is basically a hidden health crisis. If I was seriously physically sick I could tell people take off work etc. Instead of hiding it. what is Something You Use to Bring Yourself Out of a Spiral?,Depression
14871,I just cannot live my life anymore. Every day I struggle just trying to make it through living for another day. I will addictively lose myself in fiction so that I can forget I exist in reality. I binge watch shows and play video games for 10 hours straight get little sleep and binge eat snacks. Then when I inevitably have to take a break I feel an insurmountable wave of depression and misery hit me. I hate remembering I exist in reality. I hate becoming aware of my meaningless worthless disgusting ugly horrible self. Being reminded I am complete garbage and not deserving of anything I have or desire. Then it gets so bad that I feel like I need to finally do something to snap out of it. I have to take charge of my life again.So I try. I practically kill myself working incredibly hard to push through my anxiety and fear and panic trying to talk to people trying to become social trying to find new hobbies trying to go to school and trying to find jobs living healthy going to therapy... and all it does is make things worse. I do not feel any sense of relief I just find new things to stress about new things to make me feel unloved worthless and empty.So I retreat from all of them avoid them and shut them all away. And I go back to trying to numb my mind. Trying to forget I am even real. I sleep all day never getting out of bed refusing to exercise refusing to cook refusing to clean my house just wanting to forget I am even real. I do not know why I am even still around anymore to be honest.I do not even feel like I have the right to talk about depression compared to people who actually suffer through it. I am just a brat a spoiled pretentious entitled fucker. The only reason I am depressed is because I am almost 30 years old and have never been able to experience having a girlfriend. Ever since I hit puberty more than 15 years ago it is the only thing that is been on my mind. it is been my obsession yet no matter how hard I have tried I just fail.Everything else in life has been handed to me. I have a great family plenty of money I am skilled at almost anything I set my mind to I make friends easily when I want to but the one thing that always trips me up is my inability to relate to women in any kind of intimate romantic way. I always fail at that and my inability to experience the intimacy I long for and crave makes everything else in my life feel meaningless.Why should I care about being healthy having a job going to school having a family having skills and talents having hobbies having fun or doing anything if I cannot experience the one thing I want most having a lover? So I sacrifice and ignore everything else and lose myself in romantic fiction day in day out. Reading and watching it obsessively wanting to pretend the real me does not exist. I hate myself. I do not deserve to exist. I am literally the worst. I hate waking up in the morning and being alive. I cannot take this anymore,Depression

Am I being lazy? I do not know. I am tired. I just showered and i did not even want to stand up. I wanted to get out. When I did I just went back to my shitty room and that did not help.

We both had a lot of hardships and tried so desperately to keep positive. She was stuck home isolated due to unfortunate circumstances and for over a year we haven't really been able to see one another in person. I've been working hard to get a car and enough money just for a chance to see her. Even for a second. When things finally started to go into my favor...well she broke up with me. It was a mutual break up as she wanted to focus on herself and didn't wanna hurt me in anyway.But yet I feel like I've lost my only purpose of getting up in the morning. I respect her decision and her as a person. But it just hurts to badly.,Depression

And I am lonelier than I have ever felt in my entire life despite being surrounded by people. It feels like no matter how hard I try to break the cycle of defeatist thought and try to be better I cannot. The only time I feel even remotely decent is when I take my medication but it is like putting a bandaid on a flesh wound. All it does is numb me. I have tried therapy the medication does not help much and I have tried just taking it day by day. I am afraid I am at the precipice of not wanting to be any longer and I do not know how to step off that ledge and beget better. All I Feel Anymore is Anger and Loneliness,Depression

9056,Does anyone else have nonstop intrusive thoughts? My brain is nothing but suicidal thoughts foggy cannot concentrate random mush running in the background. I feel extremely numb and depressed all day. I told my parents and they are extremely supportive. I would never hurt myself but how the hell are you supposed to get through this? I just feel so terrible all day and I have these nonstop intrusive urgesthoughts of suicide death etc. Its almost long random strong urges to hurt myself. Seems to be getting worse by the day. Is this fairly normal for depression? It all feels so bad I always think there is something wrong with my brain. My emotions and mood changes 100 times a day. WTF?? My brain will not SHUT THE FCK UP!,Depression
14831,I know this question might sound odd but when does therapy usually start helping? I have been in therapy for over a year now and I am with my second therapist already. I started therapy because I did not feel well most of the time I could not concentrate and I barely ate anything. I got diagnosed with depression after a month maybe and I got some medication too but since then I did not gain anything from therapy.The medication seems to help a bit because I am having less terrible nights but at the same time therapy does not seem to help.I go there talk about my last week and we start trying to figure out where my bad moods came from but we never find out and at this point I am questening therapy eventhough every doctor told me that therapy is the most important thing.Of course I will continue therapy but it is starting to feel more like a burden to get out of my house and get on the bus for 30mins only to have the same meaningless conversation every week.My mother is worried because I still barely eat and I have been underweight for a while but I just want to feel better. I want to get rid of all these negative thoughts and find something that is worth living for.I just want my life to be less painful... When does therapy usually start helping? I am not sure if it is even worth going there anymore...,Depression
17105,idek if this is the right place to talk about this. my therapy contract is expiring soon so i feel more pressured to pretend I am doing better. I am really not and I am scared. i do not have any older adults i trust to ask for advice and i do not want to talk to a counselor from school.I am currently studying pharmaceutical sciences. it sucks bc I am not that interested in it but my parents were proud i got the offer. the thing is i keep having nightmares where i secretly synthesize drugs and take them to end my life. I have been hospitalized for overdosing several times before and just overdosed again several days ago. when i get strong suicide urges i almost always turn to overdosing on my medications. i have no idea what to do tho. idk what i want in life i just know its not whatever it is I have got going on rn. so I am not sure if i should switch my degree or just hope that I will be better a few years from now. i feel so lost and scared and all this stress really is not helping i think I am getting worse and I am scared of where I am headed,Depression
18095,Fuck I have 3 meals a day and that itself makes me 'luckier' than atleast a billion people. I have good parents who never abused me. And yet I do not want to do anything. I used to be passionate about cars but now I am completely dead inside. I just want to die in my sleep tonight and I feel so guilty for feeling this way. Hell I am not even 20 yet. I do not want to do taxes or have kids or work or anything. I am tired of being tired for no fucking reason. I feel so guilty for not being appreciating everything I have. How do you deal with guilt?,Depression
7034,I finally got my depression well under control at the end of this last year. I was managing an exercise routine cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food spending more quality time with my family enjoying hobbies again thriving in school and managing a self care and hygiene routine which was always one of my big struggles.I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior. I do not shower or brush my teeth for days at a time I find myself binge eating and falling back into restrictive eating disorder habits I only really look forward to eating and getting in bed every night. The Fall semester is set to begin and I do not even think I will be able to do it. If I am lucky I might slide by and pass but I am going to suffer even more with that on my plate too. Why the fuck cannot I be a functioning person? Sometimes I want to move away from my family and just let myself self destruct to my hearts content. I feel like I live to eat and sleep again,Depression

11207,Summary I felt great but then I called the cops on my friend for sexual assault some nsfw which they took extremely seriously and I do not want to go to court. Then my cat died and I am in pain. I think my friend filmed my family in the toilet there is lots of evidence to suggest he did. My mum told me not to call the police but I am stubborn and ignored her I thought I was doing the right thing that maybe him being on record would help future victims and that if he has any content uploaded they could find it. The police interviewed me and I told them how he used to send me porn and how I think it might be connected due to the genre. At that the police seemed concerned and went outside to contact the sergeant. They said him sending me porn was another offence they would need to investigate. I panicked and insisted it was not a big deal that I was not bothered it was just a joke I just thought there may be some connection. They said they need to contact the CID and that this is really serious. I am so scared I cannot go to court I have serious anxiety and depressive problems. All I wanted was for them to tell him off basically and put him on record not this. This has gone way too far. Before the police left the constable told me I was doing the right thing and that I was brave. I do not think I am though my friend could go to prison because of me! I hate myself so much right now. Later on my mum was driving me home and she told me my cat died. She was hit by a car which killed her instantly. I sobbed the whole way home. My mum kept her in the freezer and I needed to see because I was having a hard time believing it. She was cold and curled up like she was asleep. I sat there stroking her fur and crying. I feel like its my fault. We moved to the city near a busy road and since she kept escaping we decided to let her go outside. I was told I could send her to live with my father but I said no because he was abusive and mistreated her so I thought she would be safer with my mum. I moved away recently and could have brought her over but did not. I said the roads might be busy but I was far away from the road. And now she is dead. Its all my fault. I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago like really happy and confident I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court. I want to live and I want to be happy but I am so scared and do not think I can do it I really need help right now because everything is going wrong,Depression

17733,I know it will. And I am not happy about it. At all. In fact I am scared. I do not want it to leave me. I really do not. As horrible as it is I want it to stay with me. But according to some religious astrology stuff my dad said that 'my problems will leave me' around November. I really do not know if I can wait but I do not want to go to the mental hospital again so what I am going to do is to wait till November or December. If depression does not leave me then I will commit. But if it does oh well I do not want to think about that. The idea terrifies me. I swear I really do not want Depression to leave me. But all the things that I want to stay leave me one day and so will depression unfortunately. But I really really do not want it to. Depression will leave me,Depression

Pretty much the rest of my life depends on it.Since no one around me seems to care about my depression the only choice I am left with is to treat alone but I just do not see how that can be achieved. How do I treat this illness alone?,Depression
22211,I have been trying to tell people about my issues but they just say I am either making them up or just being melodramatic. I am sick of reaching out ,Depression
7835,So...I feel unsure about posting this because I am not sure if it is too good to be true... or maybe people will not believe me. But I think I am going to be ok and I want to share what I think really finally worked. I have major depressive disorder generalised anxiety disorder and CPTSD from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. I drink too much I hate myself. I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs booze sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process TRTP. it is 3 sessions. Session 1 stop self sabotageSession 2 address and leave behind the traumaSession 3 set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost 1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life. TRTP Holy shit.,Depression
39978,i hate myself i ve dreamed about finally gathering the courage to end my life for about year i have everything i need my basic need are met all paid by my caring family i m finishing a college degree also fully paid by my parent i feel weak and pathetic i see people with real issue traumatic shit who go on with their life while i m sitting here wanting to end my life without a reason why do i feel like this it feel invalid i ve never faced adversity every second of my life i ve spent tearing myself apart the only reason i haven t jumped in front of the metro is that i m scared to end up quadriplegic i m scared of everyone finding out that despite having my life served to me on a platter i still want to die i feel pathetic small and alone and i m scared i m starting to lose control of it before suicide felt like a refuge or a safe place to escape if necessary but now it s overwhelming and persistent i don t want to feel like this anymore but i can t stop it everything i do feel wrong i ve isolated myself from everyone and by the time i realized how lonely i felt i couldn t find the courage to reach out despite having everything given to me i feel like a failure and i hate everything about myself self loathing ha become the only way i interact with who i am and everything i do i feel like i don t deserve help i ve never faced adversity i m scared of failing to kill myself but i can t stop thinking about it,Depression

24648,Does anyone else have horrible horrible depression upon waking up every day? How do you manage it?I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 and struggle with it daily but it seems to be worse in the morning right when I wake up. As soon as I hear my alarm go off and I feel that initial exhaustion and reality sinks in I get so depressed and anxious about the day ahead that it causes minor and sometimes major panic and I begin my descent into nervous depressed hopeless hell. I battle so hard with physically leaving my bed getting ready being engaged at work etc.I think a lot of my depression is linked to the fact that I am not happy with my job and have no desire to be waking up and going to it. Its mundane and nothing remotely close to what I actually would like to do for a living. However I kind of fell into my current field when I moved out and I have not had any luck over the last 7 months searching for something Id maybe enjoy. I was let down by how difficult it is to find a job after graduating college and now feel stuck in this corporate office environment.Anyway does anyone have advice for how to deal with overwhelming morning depression? I try to focus on the little joys like seeing my dog in the morning and brewing the first cup of coffee but even then I feel like I cannot possibly keep doing this much longer before I end up quitting my job. Immediate Morning Depression. Advice?,Depression

16397,My anxiety has never been that bad generally because I just do not think that much about my future but there are times usually when I am already feeling like shit that I just completely lose it and start hyperventilating sweating buckets crying and basically just curl up into a ball and rock back and forth.The thing is that when it happens it only lasts a minute or two before I get a grip and calm down so I am not sure if they would be considered panic attacks What are panic attacks,Depression

8137,I desperately want to leave. I am currently working a minimum wage job but I did not get a college degree I only have an associates and my dad whom I live with mocks me and makes fun of the fact that I cannot afford an apartment. Hes not even supportive he just makes fun of me and says Ill never be able to move out. And I desperately want to.And yeah why are apartments so expensive? Can I even afford a studio apartment? Idk.. I worked for 5 years at a cashier and never got a raise no one did because the company went bankrupt. It was minimum wage. I hated it so I changed jobs and applied literally everywhere for 6 months and got the animal shelter gig. I am currently working at this dead end animal shelter job even though I enjoy it. Been doing this for the last 3 years. So yeah I am tired of him making fun of me I am tired of feeling stuck I wish I could move out with a minimum wage job I do not know what bachelors degree I want I do not know if Ill be able to even make time to get a bachelors degree i do not have friends to move out with I do not want roommates I am just tired of not knowing what to do..

24773,I have been at it for at least a month now I will type out some of what I want to say and I will just delete it. Its a lot to keep in and I would just share it to a trusted friend or a parent but I do not have a trusted friend and my parents are the ones causing some of the stress. I will try to keep my mom's side short basically she broke up with her boyfriend of 10 years and he broke a bunch of shit and left he is was all around an asshole and one of the reasons I am scared of everything. Yesterday my mom picked me up from my dad's and told me she needed to talk to me. At first I thought I was in trouble until she brought up her boyfriend and told me he is moving back in soon. Not even a month later and he is coming back not to mention she complained about having to live at two different places at once the amount of irony is baffling. I did not say anything and just answered with one word answers which I kind of feel bad about but I do not know what to tell her. These last two years have been the worst years of my life. I have been thinking about killing myself and I cannot find a reason I want to live I just do. I like the dreams in my head to much to give them up but that hardly seems like a reason I guess it works for now. Trying to post,Depression

12819,I will admit I have been doing alright with my new morning routine. I need to stick to all my commitments a bit better but realistically speaking I am doing way better in these last 4 days than I have done in the last 3 and a half years.That said it is excruciating. Every day the symptoms seem to be coming back harder and harder and I am finding myself sleeping less because of it. Suicidal thoughts have been there again always circling around in my head.Just screaming that I will never be good enough. It is eerily similar to a song called Carnivore by Starset. I did not do my executive exercise yesterday and I got along fairly well. But today I think I am going to go ahead and do it. it is nothing special just me clinching my fists as hard as I can for 3 minutes. But damn it is hard to not get sucked down into this. it is hard to not want to just stop. I keep wondering if this will always be there just as it always has been. Will it just keep getting worse and worse louder and louder? I wish I could find a way to tame this beast. Convince it to just work with me. We could be so powerful together. With how intense that laser focus is. I could be something I have never been. will not you come digest me?,Depression

15469,there is no point to this but I just need to vent I used to be fun funny flirty and kind of cocky even. Women loved me. Almost any date I went on women were telling me to spend the night after just a few hours. That was before I lost my careerfriendsdreamspassion for lifemotivation I met 4 different girls off tinder this month. Every single one told me they were not interested. No sex. No kiss. No romantic interest at all. And I do not blame them. I am not me anymore. I never thought I could ever miss myself but I do. I miss the old me. My whole personality is different I have no idea who I am Its making me undatableunfuckable,Depression

18004,And maybe it does. I just have not found it yet. I thought it was because I was scraping by and broke all the time. Now that I am doing ok money wise I feel like I have let down all the people who helped me out of that problem by being the same sleep for 13 hour sad sack who does not want to do anything or be around anyone. Money was not the issue. I think that no matter how much the world tries to normalize me I am going to always let everyone down and never be any different than what I am. I am here because of a google search of why am I not dead yet. I am scared to death of suicide but do not want to live. I feel like I am a disappointment to even the truly depressed. I cannot even be depressed right. To be honest I do not even know why I am typing this. Nothing helps. Nothing ever will. Doomed to work sleep and nothing else until finally I croak. Just wish it would hurry up. I got to go. Used to think depression had a reason,Depression

47646,Found out I can press criminal charges against my childhood abuser my mentally ill brother who attempted a school shooting I have a violet schizophrenicautistic brother who SA me and almost killed me multiple times during rage or psychotic episodes. During these episodes he would get violet in public. In middle school he had attacked the school cop grabbed his gun and tried to shoot at students leaving a school assembly. Lucky the cop arrested him. After that rumors started about me. I had left school for a year to deal with a serve kidney issue. Rumors came that I was in a mental hospital and no one would speak to me. Here is the thing Both my parents are accomplished attorneys. They were able to have the charges dropped and he was home a year later. He would still hit me strangle me stab me. I had to sleep with a knife under my pillow because he would break in and watch me sleep while he spoke to voices in his head. A few years later he almost murderes my mom. He hit my mom with an iron bar over her head one more hit and she would have been dead. Again they played their cards and he was home within a year. I would state to my parents about the abuse how I was scared for my life. They said I was overacting. Nothing was done to help me. I became so stressed and scared my awful father tried to put me in a group home because I said I didn't want to live there. Yet the person who caused my distressed and harm was living at home and not in the mental institution.I spoke to my therapist about this. She said since I'm only in my early 20s I can still press criminal charges against him. I am broken. I want to press charges but my parents will shun me. My parents help me financial since I am unable to work because of my kidney and seizure disorder. I know they would leave me homeless or try to get back at me and charge me with a stupid crime. My father was able to lie to the police operator about my mom to have her arrested and institutionalized. I am terrified of my father and my mom cares more about my brother than I. She knows he raped me and hurt me but still demands I come to his birthday or she won't pay my rent. Also he SA my mom multiple times while I was a teen. Yet my mom says she stays with him for his money. She would tell me thus as a teen which is so sick to involve a child when you are staying with him.I want to charge him so badly. My parents lied to me when I was a teenager when I wanted to go to the police. They said that the police won't help me. Finding our that my family lied to me knew about the abuse and now several years later learning he could have been charged is destroying me. I want to press charges. I have no money for an attorney.I'd lose everything become homeless my mom who is the only person I care about would never speak to me again. I am having horrible flashbacks. My therapist also stated that I should be proud that I havnt killed myself since most others would have with what Ive been through. This is after she knew I had slit my throat at 18. I can't stop crying.,Depression

10749,I am 22M living in a Mumbai India . I come from a well to do family with loving and supportive parents but now everytime I con only think about how I failed them. They never forced me do anything and never pressurised me to perform great in school. I did not have a bad social life either there was no bullying in my school I had good at social interactions with my peers and teachers and had a great rapo with them. My father came from nothing and achieved everything himself. I feel a pressure to out do him but nobody is telling me to do so. I have screwed up my life academically I never had to work hard to achieve anything I was good at sports and academics but slowly as competition started to increase i gave up on things and retreated. I started consoling myself that somehow I am destined to be sucessful and I started to belive it. Everytime I sleep I hope I do not wake up tomorrow or if I do wake up I wake up when i was 13 yrs old so I can re do my life with the current wisdom. Everytime my family goes out on vacation I hope they do not come back die so I can have an excuse for the failure I will become in future. The only reason I am not killing my self is because I do not want my parents to suffer due to me as they did everything right and provided everything for me. I hope everybody forgets about my existence just so I can just leave. I am lost I do not know what is ahead,Depression
9748,do not give that please do not its not good screw that I want to know how do I cut myself where to cut myself how do I hide it and probably I will let my parents see how I feel they keep dragging me down guilt tripping me I do not care what you think of me or about this post. I. Want. To. Feel. Pain. Physically. I want to feel pain,Depression
16073,it is not that I never feel any excitement or emotions. I can get excited about a new game tear up for a sad movie laugh at a joke and even smile when something good is happening. it is just these feelings these emotions they come as suddenly as they disappear. Because these feelings fade away so quickly I often find myself seeking out new material to stimulate my emotions be it a good book a new game or a sad movie. But it really sucks because even when I am doing this I easily lose interest and end up having to start something new way before I even come close to finishing what I just started. Yet despite this I cannot stop because if I do not do this I feel like I am simply just breathing and not actually living. I am always overwhelmed by boredom and fatigue but even more than that I just feel so very empty all the time. Its as if there is a large gaping hole at the bottom of my heart no matter how much I fill it up everything just falls right out and once again it is empty again. The excitement fades too quickly,Depression

If I was happy I would continue living but I cannot see anything picking up and I see nothing in anything I do. And my parents hate me I have got no friends I play for the second best football team in my country but I just do it because I am good at it and not because I enjoy it.Society does not care about men we are just like a disposable bottle society pretend to care but these fake depression people take over and the people who need help do not get it.Death does not phase me it is like being stupid it is only painful for others.I am so dead inside I could literally watch people get killed Infront of me and I would not cry. that is not a flex just got to get it off my chest. My philosophy,Depression
18376,About a week and a half ago I was in the middle of a road trip and the main plan was to go skydiving for our first time. I went with my roommates a couple and we did.Well sort of. My roommate did not jump. it is whatever but maybe not totally. Anyways his girlfriend and I did jump.During the wait and the climb and when we were about to drop I was nervous. But I was determined to do this for myself so that is what I did. As we plunged out of the plane my instructor tandem we dropped for maybe 30 seconds free fall pulled the chute and floated to the ground. I initially thought it was crazy. Insane. Thought there is a chance I might die if the chute failed. But it did not. And while we dropped I was a little scared but as I landed on the ground I found myself disappointed. While I was hoping to feel something really genuine I really did not. What I felt was fear sure but not actually life threatening fear and had no adrenaline for doing it. I now a week and a half later feel as if I have done nothing in the past two weeks.Can I not feel something real? Is this all just an idea I foster for myself that I can feel true excitement again? Or is it a lie? Can I really not feel things for what they are now? I have so many questions that I cannot answer yet I cannot even bring myself to a counselor to figure this out.I do not know anymore. I expect nothing good from this to be honest. I jumped out of a plane and found out I am more dead inside than I would originally thought,Depression
20005,Does anyone else get the feeling that there is someone else living inside them? I feel like my brain is not me half the time and that it is someone else in these moments I feel as if I cannot control my thoughts and actions like there is someone else controlling me.I feel like I have lost myself as a person and that I am trying to be someone I am not. My mind is so focused on being part of one aesthetic that I cannot like anything except the things that fall into that category. I am always comparing myself to other people and asking myself why I am not exactly like them then I try to replicate myself to be exactly like that person. I feel so lost in this body of mine.I am so sick of the amount of anxiety I have been feeling lately I feel it everyday and sometimes all I have to do is think about something and it will make me anxious. it is gotten so much worse as I have gotten older and I just want this to end. I need to vent,Depression

8819,TW Mention of self harm and attempts. My sister and I both suffer from severe depression and anxiety solely because of our alcoholic father. I have been suffering since I was 13 yrs old and I felt like I had recovered for the most part. My sister is 16 and has been suffering from depression for a few months now and it has progressively gotten worse. She was self harming and has attempted 3 times over the past few months. My father obviously does not care and my mom is very closeminded and does not know how to communicate with my sister. I had to drop out of school and quit my job so I could stay home full time to watch my sister and make sure she is safe. I have taken her to the hospital several times and she stayed in the mental health unit for a few months but it has not made a difference. she is back home and I am constantly on edge because I am worried she is going to somehow hurt herself. I try my best to keep an eye on her and I basically follow her everywhere around the house. Everytime my parents find out she managed to cut herself under my care or attempted they blamed me for being careless. I love my sister with all my heart. I am fucking exhausted and I can feel myself wanting to give in but I know I have to be strong for my sister. Am I an awful person for thinkingfeeling this way? I feel trapped and I do not know how to take care of myself and also take care of my sister simultaneously. I think my depression is coming back from looking after my suicidal sister.,Depression
9436,I have tried to tell my friends about my depression. They either think I am joking around or just do not say anything. It hurts. What hurts more is that I tell them I want to hang out so I can distract myself for a little while and they either completely forget or they all hang out and do not invite me. I do not know what to do anymore. I have such a hard time making friends and an even harder time keeping them. I cannot take being alone anymore because all I can think about is death but no one wants me around. I hate being alive. My friends do not even care,Depression

39439,a little over a month ago i wa over at a friend s house and got to drinking pretty heavily over the night that i spent a his place every so often he would take the bottle away from me and temporarily and hide because he had the impression that i downing a full bottle of liquor at a dangerously fast pace for whatever neurotic reason the idea became supplanted in my head that he wa trying to intentionally hide it away from me so he could spike the bottle with a finely powdered lead in order to cause me to ingest large amount of a neurotoxic chemical to produce measurable brain damage surely this isn t likely whatsoever right it s all i ve been able to ob and ruminate over for well over a month now i could elaborate on a million different pattern and detail and inform you of the interpersonal context between the both of u but then i feel like i d be trying to create and extract a specific response out of people these are the bare bone and objective happening of the night in mention i ve even seen a doctor about trying to get tested for possible acute lead exposure and hinted towards psychological deterioration on a quantifiable level my intuition tell me that my saboteur had successfully managed to reduce my iq by several point and inflict a speech impediment issue which involves a portmanteau synthesis between word in my inner dialogue the way that it wa explained to me from a team of professional who discussed my case wa that because i m an adult it s much harder for a single instance of lead exposure ingestion to be absorbed or produce any perceptible effect or cross the blood brain barrier due to a lack of iron deficiency and binding capacity to red blood cell ergo a test would not be necessary or productive in my case however i can t shake the idea out of my mind i can t dissolve it or even compartmentalize it a i navigate through the day it s escalated to the point where it s infected every part of my conscious thinking and convinced me that i m no longer capable of achieving any of the goal i ve set for myself with my newfound profound disability that are only noticeable to me surely this is something so asinine so comically absurd that the idea should be laughed at the point of it conception why can t i disentangle the idea from my head it s put me into a state of complete inaction i m too paranoid to engage in any socially or mentally stimulating activity because i m terrified that the sting of observing my cognitive deficit in real time will manifest and i won t be able to articulate myself to anyone or anything for the rest of my life and the stuttering habit i never had that issue before never have i ever possessed an affinity for transposing syllable or stating sentence in incorreclty disjointed sequence i used to write quite frequently before this and conversely i feel an all consuming negation of my emotional affectivity and spontaneity my thought aren t being organically generated and i feel a if i have to strain to think of anything lucid or insightful is it natural to feel like your thought have been utterly attenuated and obliterated with anxiety is it normal to feel a if time is accelerating itself faster than your consciousness can adapt to it progression is it natural to feel former part of your identity and desire to become increasingly disfigured obscured and foreign to yourself the aforementioned friend that i spoke of no longer talk to me a we had a falling out with one another over a relationship that wa rife with gaslighting think of the breadcrumbing tactic some narcissist employ maybe that spurred the main causal effect for why i m patternizing my memory in the way that i am but pouring granulated lead into my liquor without me noticing or it producing any physiological effect that s laughable right,Depression
24118,I recently moved for college. I definitely had moments where I felt sad in high school and at home but its never been that bad. I feel really crushes by my expectations. There was this guy I talked to and I thought that we could really like each other. But I feel like I just liked the idea of him and I really do not know anything about him. I do not know why I cannot stop liking people. I want a relationship to feel good about myself and to not feel lonely and I know this could never lead to happiness. The only sense of excitement I feel is when someone likes me back or when I get compliments. I always posts pictures of myself on social media to feel good and so that other can think I am good looking. I do not like who I am now. I feel like I constantly rely on others people validation. I have talents and achievements but I feel like I do them all to have the ability to say I did them. Or I do things so that I can tell others about them and they can think that I am talented and good at things. I cannot even enjoy shows books or games without feeling like they are all pointless eventually. I do not really know what I like or what I am good at. I do not really know what it means to be happy and I have always felt this emptiness inside for a really long time. I think too much about school and I am obsessive about grades. Even when I score badly on a meaningless assignment I feel awful about myself and I believe that if I do not do well that means that others are better than me. I constantly compare myself to others too. I do not know how to have fun because all I do is worry. I am shy and introverted around people because I worry that they will judge me for what I say and I always pick my words so that they put me in the best light and so that they will like me. It makes it difficult for me to make friends and go out because I am terrified of what they will think of me. I do not know if I really enjoy anything. Everything in my life feels like a checklist. I do not think about dying a lot but I do imagine what its like to just be gone. I do not really think ill miss out on anything. I do not see how my life can get better if I do not truly enjoy anything. I know that a lot of the things I do are wrong but I do not know how to get better. I do not know how to feel good about myself and my achievements or anything I do. Even when I get validation for others I do not feel better. And it hurts even more when I am rejected or fail. I do not know how to get better,Depression

28000,Part of what makes good writing is having small specific details and the little stories that make up the novel as a whole. This is why I was hoping that if you are interested you could send me stories of your experiences in an abusive relationship whatever detail you choose to send it doesn't have to be anything epic and grand it could be the smallest segment that you hold significance to. If you have any questions about what I'm looking for let me know though I'm really looking for anything! Feel free to post them here or private message me. Thank you in advance 3,Normal

28912,So for a few years now I've been in a relationship with this girl who very likely has PTSD given her upbringing. She has trust issues after suffering abuse from her birth parents at a young age and her situation is only complicated further with bipolar depression and fetalalcohol syndrome. She's in good hands now living with her aunt and is becoming independent with a job. Though I've noticed throughout our relationship that she has a tendency to push me away l whereas I am the exact opposite though I understand her situation it's not her fault. She says she loves me and I love her but she doesn't seem comfortable showing any affection holding hands hugging and kisses on the cheek are extremely rare from her.,Normal

50750,AvPD or something else? Sorry if this is actually completely normal or offtopic. Basically I find myself so genuinely hideous in a You look too ridiculous to seriously expect anyone to acknowledge you as a fellow human being kind of way. It doesn't just stop at my appearance either. It's literally every single facet of my being that is too ridiculous to ever be taken seriously. It prevents me from talking to people finding a well paying job making friends of any kind doing literally anything out of the ordinary including necessary appointments like the doctor or even wanting to be alive. The only person I see regularly now outside of work is my therapist who insists there isn't anything wrong with me as a person but I find it incredibly hard to believe he doesn't see just how unbelievably embarrassing and stupid I am. This feeling causes me constant distress and is completely unshakeable even though I am aware of how logically silly it is and I worry it might mean I have a personality disorder because it handicaps every part of my life. Obviously no one on here can diagnose me but I guess I am wondering if it sounds similar to what you guys deal with.,Personality-disorder
51339,Are you a fawn? In Pete Walker's work there are 4 types of trauma responses. Fight flight freeze and the last least spoken about fawn. Fawning is just as it sounds. You fawn over people. You people please and bend to their will even if you know it's fucking you over in the long run. I feel like being a fawn has caused me to hate people even more than I should lol. Because when people come around they usually come with some bs that I don't really want anything to do with. Wanting favors wanting me to be their emotional punching bag wanting validation wanting talk at me wanting me to give them stuff etc. I don't have a back bone and it's really hard for me to tell people to kick rocks without feeling guiltySo it just becomes another reason why I isolate myself. Nobody can drag me into their drama if nobody is there to begin with.Are you like this?,Personality-disorder
50658,Quality over quantity Friendships I know people with AvPD struggle to maintain friendships and I do too. For me I think it's the daily or at least frequent messaging to stay in touch that I struggle with. I will get tired and ignore messages just because I don't have the capacity to engage with a subject that I frankly probably don't care much about or I'm just worn out by the constant interaction. The messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me. if it's a friend that lived far away then I'd rather not speak for 6 months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and fortunately I do have a couple that are like that. Anyone relate?,Personality-disorder
51317,I quit my job without telling my boss So I work as a cashier and this saturday 28th was supposed to be my last day there end of my contract which was going to be renewed but last saturday 21th after my long shift I decided I couldn't go through another week at this workplace so I took all my stuff and left for good without telling anyone.This job has burnt me out so much and gave me panic attacks and I didn't see myself staying there another week. But I was mostly afraid to tell my boss that I didn't want to renew my contract too scared to see disappointment on her face and to let them down... So by quiting early I wouldn't have to face this situation...I didn't show up on Monday and didn't call but I sent to HR a doctor's note from my psychiatrist telling them that I am taking a break from work. My boss has tried to call me yesterday but I didn't respond. I feel shitty right now and I hate this AVPD.... This fear of confrontation and disappointing is killing me.,Personality-disorder
50502,Anyone else have nothing in common with other people? When I see normal people constantly talk and have fun with it I'm genuinely shocked.

Nobody around me has the same lvl so I can't even train to become stronger doomed to lose every encounter.,Personality-disorder
50982,Is it petty to treat someone the same way they treat you? Recently I noticed I was people pleasing too hard and decided to try a little less. I was too clingy was the one to wait after class to go together was the one to write first etc. My friend usually doesn't do the same and as someone with rejection sensitivity predictably it hurt. So when I stopped trying so hard my friend seemed hurt. She said something about me not waiting for her like I usually do. Admittedly it felt good to finally let go a little and have some selfrespect. But I also feel so bad for being kinda... petty. I don't think she did all this on purpose because overall she is a really good and caring friend. Maybe I just frustrated her with being too clingy in the past?,Personality-disorder
50507,How to deal with inperson avoidance? Hi dear community!I have a question my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.And I noticed that when hes going through an anxiety episode or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.For example if he feels embarrassed or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will hide behind his laptop or walk behind or in front of me distancing himself physically while still being kind its more of a way of hiding from me when he cant actually leave. For example when we share a hotel room on vacationI did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking that he does reciprocateeven when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but Im not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it or if he likes it that Im gently being reassuring and consistent.My dear AvpdErs when feeling low do you like being comforted or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!Thanks everyone !!,Personality-disorder
50841,how many people here have social anxiety as well? I keep forgetting that some of my vent posts are actually more to do with social anxiety than avpd at least it seems to be that way because people in here don't seem to relate to some of my posts so I guess it's more to do with social anxiety than avpd. Just wondering if u guys think you have both or just avpd. I'm a bit confused about how some people with avpd don't have social anxiety as I thought they went hand in hand but I guess not.,Personality-disorder

Then at the hairdresser being reminded Im not normal as I try and fake being so for the consultation. Next week I have to sit an hour and 45 minutes while they dye my hair. Why is socialising so difficult. I hate leaving my house and being reminded of what I am.,Personality-disorder

I legit had NO IDEA that I had it insanely bad up until now. Drunk friend got on top of me we made out she started undressing and I legit just stared at her BLANK. Had no idea what to do why she would do that and what to think. That's when it hit me. I'm an absolute social failure. I can never initiate anything I never talk about emotions and now I truly understand the only way I'll ever have sex is by getting raped. That's it. I CAN'T EVEN RETURN A FUCKING HUG! I don't want to be like this. I'm fucking 25 already. I legit didn't care about any of that until I realized how nice a kiss felt. I can only imagine what sex feels like. I fucking hate my life. I fucking hate I'll never get to be with someone because all I can do is shut inside myself and cry from a distance. Funny thing is I'm fit and average looking with a way above average salary. But it's all useless when I have absolutely 0 social skills. Fuck my parents and fuck my bullies. I can't go back in the past. I will always be like this. I already missed on my youth.

To my horror I found out later that it wasnt anonymous. I had no idea what AvPD was then but it is shockingly relatable to look back on now. Hard to post but it feels important that I do.I want to be understood but cannot be vulnerable.The one who shows their hand first loses.Carve into me and leave your markthe first one to strike feels betrayed mostThe retaliation is serratedBut I just wanted to know youwithout borders without painI just wanted to know youYou like me if you can assort melabel me and pin me downaggressive bitch salty witchinnocent dreamer batshit idealist.You color me all kinds of elegantbut when it comes down to itIm only an impressionist.I keep trying to break free of what comes naturally to mefind myself in the labels you offer mebut the mirror image is fake and so am II want to feel myself without your hand in my definition.,Personality-disorder

51088,hi HiI'll start by saying I've been diagnosed with AvPD about 2 years ago around the end of my military service but it's something I've dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a 22 years old still. I'm seeing a therapist for the better part of 2 years now and it helps mainly mentally not physically yet as I'm not doing much spending all my days at home no friends no social life no nothing. I did get a job last week which I'm starting next week 4 hours a day cleaning some school buildings 5 minutes from my house.But as the time goes I find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff I'd like to do like traveling the world and studying I even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like 3 days before the semester started. Since then I'm daydreaming about traveling going to south america or something..Last week I said screw it and booked a ticket to Barcelona for a trip with my mom and sister. I was very excited as I'm a big FC Barcelona fan for years but as we all know something has to go wrong. We're supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days I had in the last couple of years. I feel like I just wanna disappear until Friday arrives when the trip is over. I feel like it's a task someone is commanding me to finish and not something I ever wanted to do. It took me some time cause I usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister and now they're thinking whether they should cancel or go and they're waiting for my desicion. I also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didn't know like how I don't talk to my 2 friends anymore or how before I got this poor job I was sending CV's and when people would call me I couldn't pick up the phone. I told her that I feel lonely even when I'm with them my family cause while they do make me feel good they can't cover up for my nonexistent social life.Seriously I feel like a mess I roam around feeling down like I've never felt before I think. Just want to vent a little ,Personality-disorder

50777,Feeling like an empty body with nothing inside. Im a 24 year old female and I never developed my own personality. I also suspect I have autism because I did a lot of research and I just know my brain is wired differently. I cant hold friendships and I hurt them because I keep them on a distance. They cant help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low. Because of this I have a lot of traumas. When I was a kid I was neglected by my parents because they were addicts. I lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause I tried to commit suicide. It wasnt a serious attempt. I just didnt know how to get out of the situation. Anyway Im 24 now and Ive learned a lot so far. Between my 1822 I did a lot of drugs and I felt normal. I felt like people wanted to be friends with me because I was social and talkative and not scared at all. But deep down I knew it was fake. The friendships I build were fake. I tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in. And next to that I was in an abusive relationship. I was paranoid and stressed. Always scared theyd find out the real me. And I did this for so long I dont even remember who I am right now. I am depressed diagnosed with ptsd AvPD and traits of borderline disorder. I asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didnt think I have enough traits to fit the criteria. I dont really care about labels but I feel like there is something really wrong with me. Im an alien in this world. It feels so alone.Sorry for the long text. Im prone to addiction and Im addicted to Xanax right now. I get admitted to a rehab clinic this Friday for 21 nights and then straight after that to Portugal for intense therapy. Im glad to have this opportunity and Ill definitely get out of my comfort zone. I know they wont fix my problems but itll hopefully give me the push I need to work hard. Cause I do believe I can find out who I am and make real friends without being fake. I have hope and I want you to have it tooWere all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important getting out of your comfort zone. Do things that are scary. Take baby steps. Dont set the bar too high for yourself. Everyone is different so you cant compare yourself to others.Good luck everyone and just keep swimming,Personality-disorder

51051,Sometimes I feel like I don't actually exist like I'm a ghost of sorts. Does anyone else know this feeling? I don't speak to anyone most days. Just my mom and dad sometimes my sister. When I do speak my voice sounds all weird because of the lack of practice. It's kinda funny because I've noticed that despite being fluent in English it's my second language but I've studied it since I was a kid sometimes I forget how to speak it properly. Sometimes I say things that don't make grammatical sense or I don't pronounce words correctly. Idk why this is happening. Maybe because I rarely speak with other people that aren't my parents. No one ever notices me. In school it doesn't matter if I sit on the back or all the way on the front no one ever talks to me and I don't talk to anyone. I haven't had a meaningful relationship of any kind with anyone in literal years. The last friend I ever had was when I was 12. I'm 23 now. I spent all high school sitting by myself behind a tree. Even now in college I'm by myself. I rarely leave my house. It's so fucking pathetic but I just can't make friends. I don't relate to anyone. I don't feel comfortable around anyone. I feel like I'm acting whenever I interact with someone like it's not real. I don't feel like a real person.,Personality-disorder

50550,Feeling down lately It was my birthday the other day and it was a bit depressing. I spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza it was good though lol I didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake also good. I was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my momI dont have many friends besides a few online friends and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me. When I see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry. My friend says everybody cares and loves me but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their livesTo make this worse my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her. The last time i had a therapist who knew of my avpd they screamed at me and said i couldnt be helped...This is all just making me feel hopelessly depressed and feeling rejected ,Personality-disorder

50533,this disorder has stopped me from pushing myself for the better me. Was scrolling on tiktok when I saw my previous school mate 2 years younger than me on my FYP. She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby her father was also a race car driver before helped her achieve big things but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. My best friend is so fckin smart she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart all of his grade averages are 95 100 is the highest in my country. I'm surrounded by smart and talented people with a future people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself while they're here working their ass off for their future.My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away. I'm gonna be 20 in october my teen years are finally over. I didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are supposed to experience. I can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.,Personality-disorder
51363,AvPD doesnt mean that your brain is ill right? I was thinking that AvPD isnt caused by some brain illness. It is very possible that most people with AvPD have healthy brain right?I feel like AvPD is just that we learned things incorrectly we were exposed to some very stressful situations as child and our brains learned that that situation this is bad.And now our functioning brain is reminding us with anxiety that this situation is familiar from past when we were learning things. And this anxiety is causing us to avoid these situations because we were learnt that they are bad.So from this point we can say that our brain is normally functioning? Brain is doing what it is supposed to be doing trying to stay out of danger and survive.,Personality-disorder

Im fairly sure I have this disorder because Ive looked into it a lot and I resonate so much with what I read online about it.Im just wondering what people mean when they say this disorder causes a lack of sense of self? I 100 have this issue but Im not really sure why? Im usually thinking of it in a social context because it feels like Im not enough of a person to make connections but I dont know if its for the same reason you guys might feel that way. Is it from social inhibition and repressing ourselves so much or something else? This is something about myself Ive been trying to figure out for awhile,Personality-disorder
50703,I took public transit today. After not being able to step foot out of the house without my ex driving me I finally was able to step up and go on public transit by myself. Its been 2 years since Ive taken the bus. I honestly did not know what I was doing but I asked the drivers for help and directions as to which bus to get on next etc etc Social anxiety was at an all time high and still is writing this on the way home. So many people are on this bus and the only thing Im thinking about is when do I get home and why are they looking at me. Realistically theyre looking at me because people have eyes and observe whats in front of them and scolding myself that they dont have hidden agendas is helping lol. For anyone who hasnt been able to take public transit because of this stupid fucking difficult disorder I sympathize. It gets easier. Dont have much to say just wanted to share bc this is a massive achievement for me.,Personality-disorder
50834,Jesus taught avoidance I'm certain I'd be diagnosed with this disorder and many prophets would too.John the Baptist for example lived in the wilderness until he started his ministry. Now that is dedication!There are many verses related to AvPD in the Bible I'll post some at the bottom.I avoid everyone but Jesus because he is infinitely loving and wise and talking to other people is TORTURE in comparison.I've experienced this phenomenon in my life many times and I see it constantly across every facet of life friend groups businesses etcIf a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand.

Therefore anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. James 44If you belonged to the world it would love you as its own.

51491,Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart and attractive and I care for people but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my first love?The first guy Dave I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side. We only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. The second guy Steve I met a year later at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives. We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wpn90,Personality-disorder
50621,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know but in the platonic sense too.i don't even think i'm physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera.don't get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age i feel like it's too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people.but i think that's okay. somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food.there's some days when loneliness hurts though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.You think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont. In fact you feel more alone than you did before you left But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. Bojack Horseman,Personality-disorder
51296,When people get to know me they dont like me. Im boring and awkward I can put up good mask at first but under it.. is something most people dont want. I heard through another person that a friend of mine thinks Im too sensitive and she cant relate to me. Me being myself disappoints people.,Personality-disorder
50809,Being Burned When Reaching Out I want to know if any of you have had this experience.Ever since I was a child a pattern has been that I am verbally offered support and love but when it matters and when I reach out for it it would be rescinded. As a kid I blamed myself and turned inward. As an adult if I fall for an insincere invite for connection or help I feel humiliated and angry with them and myself. I realize this has made me extra sensitive and I even expect to be rejected. It is extremely hard now to ask for help. When someone burns me I dont think I will ever trust them againhard stop. When someone comes through I feel completely overwhelmed with gratitude. Im not even sure of the word for the emotion of that. Im crying as I write this. I think my expectations are too black and white but I dont know how to be change other than to keep giving people chances.,Personality-disorder
50871,harmless situations cause embarrassment and shame i dont understand why such minor situations cause me so much embarrassment and shame. i just asked to sign up for something and i was told i cant until tomorrow and now im hating myself and wishing id never leave my house or socialize. thats something that would mean nothing to other people and yet it makes me feel nauseous. i really hope these symptoms can get better because i dont know how i could live the rest of my life this way. im tired of feeling constant shame and embarrassment when im in public and within social situations that leave me feeling suicidal when its never a big deal to anyone else. i hate how sensitive i am especially to silly things. does anyone else feel this way?,Personality-disorder
51395,Have you ever had best friend? From most posts I read here it seems like most of you had avoidant behavior since childhood and it was the same for me.So considering you were avoidant since you were a child you probably had issues making friends since then. So have you ever had someone you called your best friend and they called you their best friend too?I had friend like this we were best friends for about 19 years. When I left for University then we stopped being in contact slowly. We met few times after that but at this point I feel like we are not even friends anymore.But he was my good friend I have to say he knew that I was shy and weird but he always called me out to meet with people.,Personality-disorder
51535,Conversational and social skills what are they I think Ive never given myself a chance to develop them because of AvPD. I couldve had a fuller social life in school but I was so in my shell I just had a few close friends. And even with them I felt I couldve been better. It seemed like they all clicked with each other very well and even though we were all good friends sometimes there was something missing in my connection with people. I know they say skills are to be learned but it really really REALLY seems like its just inborn for other people. So I just do everything I can to avoid one on one conversations so nobody has the chance to think Im weird and dont know how to talk or something.,Personality-disorder
50726,I'm going back to therapy I'm 21 and I'm going back to college soon. I'm really afraid about the socialization part that comes with college.

I've somehow managed to have sex with multiple different people yet every time I feel wayyyyyyyy too anxious to actually enjoy any of the pleasure and instead delegate myself to please my partner instead. When I think about sex it seems appealing but whenever I actually get to have it I can't help but panic and be scared that I'm not good enough for them... Is this normal? Can anyone else relate?

51447,Feeling down lately It was my birthday the other day and it was a bit depressing. I spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza it was good though lol I didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake also good. I was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my momI dont have many friends besides a few online friends and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me. When I see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry. My friend says everybody cares and loves me but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their livesTo make this worse my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her. The last time i had a therapist who knew of my avpd they screamed at me and said i couldnt be helped...This is all just making me feel hopelessly depressed and feeling rejected ,Personality-disorder
50686,Nobody Knows It But Me Like a clown I put on a show The pain is real even if nobody knows Now I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me The lyrics from the song Nobody knows by Tony Rich Project has always really stuck with me. It illustrated perfectly how Id felt for such a long time. It hit me like a load of bricks how beautifully it described that feeling. A feeling that Id struggled so much to put into words was put so simply and it brings tears to my eyes even now. How sad it is that only You would know this feeling and nobody could relate. It's a tragic love song actually but some lines of the song just resonate with me as someone with AVP.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vPf0BA5IA9Ihttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vPf0BA5IA9I,Personality-disorder

But I often think about the people that went out there way to be nice to me they would have got noting out of it they did it just to be nice maybe they could see I was shy and lonely and had pity for me so they would talk or smile or say good morning to me to make me feel like a human being even though people pitying me makes me feel embarrassed and small I appreciate it so much but Im never able to show it so I just pray for them every day and hope they are having amazing lives and I hope they know they are angels.,Personality-disorder

51087,I can't tell if I'm jealous of other people I think I like my life when I am alone. I am happy to be by myself do my work and my chores and I have hobbies that bring me joy. But it feels as if it all comes crashing down and a heavy sense of depression and grief hangs over me as soon as I'm reminded that other people do fun things together. I don't want to join them because most of the time having fun with friends isn't actually fun for me but the feeling persists and can go on for days. I know it's silly to feel resentful of these other people and it makes me resentful towards myself as well. I just want to make it stop. Ex driving my sister who is still in high school to hang out with her friends or go on dates.

50680,I feel like Ive missed out on my teenage years Its so depressing to think people have spent all these years going out with their friends and partying whilst I was just on my own in my room. Ive always had barely any friends and never been in a relationship or had a paid job I only managed to start doing a few hours a week voluntary work a few months ago. I watch the people around me do exciting things and make new friends and get partners whilst Im just here bored alone and depressed as usual. It doesnt help that later this year Ill move away from this town for university and Ill probably never see most of the people Ive spent years wanting to be friends or more with but been too scared to talk to again. It feels like this phase of my life is really slipping through my fingers and I have no time to repair it. I try to tell myself at least I have the future where I could become better and make the next phases of my life better than this one but in reality I know that Ive just been declining for years so I doubt that very much.,Personality-disorder

So. Fucking. Scared.This isn't anything O new situation fear no I've been to the museum once or twice and know the people I know the community. But I am so damn fucking scared of rejection. I am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me. I am scared of the social aspects of it.I keep getting these thoughts of they'll think I'm a creep I'll probably never keep up with it because I am a pathetic good for nothing lower to everyone else.It's hurting me. And I need advice on how to just keep going what should I do once it starts? Fight through the thoughts and fears?It was already hard enough as it was to do the paper now I'm crashing wondering What the fuck was I thinking!? But I'm trying to keep positive as much as I possibly can. This could be a mix of social anxiety and AVPD running it's course but I don't know all I know is that I am scared and very fearful of the future of people of being seeing in public of messing up big time.Any words of encouragement or advice will help a lot.

Not just verbally but by interacting with them at all. I'll go to family events and think how much I love everyone there but am too anxious to join in on talking to people. I feel like people think I don't like them when that couldn't be further from the truth. I'm so uncomfortable and embarrassed by expressing affection itself too. It's like there's this block in my head that prevents me from getting the words out. This is why I know I'd be incapable of a romantic relationship never had one.

50973,Married ExCoworker Stress So there's a situation that occurred and it's tearing me apart from the inside. I'm absolutely terrible at showing emotions and making a move. Hence my terminal aloneness. I wish it was terminal...Last year during the summer I temporarily got to experience what it was like to be wanted. A coworker and I became friends and she seemed to express interest in me. Time and time I'd go hang out with her only to go home banging my head in frustration and wondering wtf was going on. Here's my only other post about her for reference httpswww.reddit.comrAvPDcommentsw1us95situationinvolvingmarriedcoworker?utmsourceshareamputmmediumandroidappamputmnameandroidcssamputmterm1amputmcontentsharebutton Tldr of old post she's married but they are about to separate over issues they've had for years. For those that think I'm being scummy maybe. But she's leaving the country for good next month without him. Meanwhile she's seemingly expressed interest in me while at the same time holding me at arms length away. She tells me all of these personal things about herself including some secrets she says she's never told anyone. However If she gives me a hug it's half hearted most of the time. But with other guys like the one she said weirded her out she is willing to fully embrace them. Here's a worse part I have a car and she can't drive. So when she needed things she'd pretend to want to hang out and go check something out. Usually then we'd go back to her place and she'd cook something for me and I wouldn't feel it was a total loss getting food for the gas spent. But the last two times I went over there she kept going on and on about how tired she was so I left. Basically having been used as a free Uber. But here's the worst part!The other day on Valentine's Day I called her up and she's busy chatting with strangers on Omegle. This one guy is flirting with her and she keeps telling me about how good he looks... and how he wants to do an online video date with her clothes optional. The whole time she's giggling and basically ignoring what I'm saying. So I say I've got something to do and hang up. She has the fucking nerve to call me back and want a ride somewhere before she goes home to get some rest. I keep it short and civil what choice do people like us have? and basically hang up and go to bed. The next day I texted her to ask how did your little edate go? She responded huh? and I haven't talked to or heard from her since. Highly unusual because she always calls me several times on my 2 days off. Those days are over and I feel an incredible amount of stress about it.. my heart is going crazy and I feel like I'm waiting to get punished by the principle or something. I guess I lost whatever that was.. Life never wastes an opportunity to kick me when I'm down.,Personality-disorder

Ive literally been keeping all my feelings inside for years so its all just been building up and a few weeks ago I had a total breakdown and texted this guy I barely know just telling him about this thing that happened. And hes like twice my age and I just work next to him I saw him a fair bit but I never really talked to him of course because avpd so things were just always awkward. But the thing is he was super nice about it and so then I WAY overshared and texted him a bunch of personal shit and it made total sense when I was sending it and then the next day I was like what the hell did I send this guy? And now I feel SO embarrassed and I just dont know what to do with this feeling. And the worst part is I still cant talk to him I saw him for the first time the other day since sending that text and he was being so nice about it and I still couldnt talk to him. And I might not see him again for a while because my job is kinda changing right now but I just dont know what to do with this feeling.TLDR Got super emotional and texted this guy who I barely talked to a bunch of personal shit.

Ive been going to a psychiatrist for years whos treated me for depression Zoloft. Ive always been shy overly self critical etc. Ive been to 5 Therapists over the last 20 years none have really helped me. Weve identified the causes of my AVPD very critical parents physical abuse. . Sexual abuse in Jr High. However thats a far as I get. The rest is just talking about my feelings. I get 6 to 9 mos in and I feel like Im just saying the same stuff. So I quit. Has any AVPDsufferers ever had success with Therapy? What does success look like? I cant even imagine. Are you more socially successful and bulletproof from criticism? What methods did you use in Therapy that made you successful? What did you do beyond talking about your traumas that helped you?What kind of Therapist was helpful in getting passed or improving? Is there some specialization or kind of therapist that is more successful with AVPD? Thx.,Personality-disorder

51574,Conversations Anybody else feel like they dont have the natural ability to have good conversations?Whenever Im having a conversation with strangers Im often pretty quiet and I dont know what to say unless its work related or something Im really familiar with. I think this is normal with society anxiety thoughBut whenever I have conversations with a group of people Im comfortable with like my family I feel like I suck at having conversations. If its about a topic I dont care about I always zone out or stare at out the window. If its about a topic Im interested in its so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn I can wait but it stresses me out and its hard to jump in sometimes. It feels like Im going to forget what I was going to say or theyll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk I feel like people dont really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations sometimes its just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background. Anybody relate,Personality-disorder

50766,DAE struggle to talk to people they like? I've been focusing on identifying people I truly personally like in therapy. Or well. More like validating my own opinions but it always comes back to people. I have a net of people I'm really 'close' with because of the way my uni living was set up. And I'm realizing through a lot of questions that there are people I just don't actually like I'm surrounding myself with? Or people I want to interact with more that I know will make me happier compared to my current friend group.But I can't help but think that anybody I would actually enjoy talking to couldnt possibly like me as a result. I think it's become a selffulfilling prophecy. The more I criticise myself the more I pull back the less I interact with people and the world and the less 'worthy' I am. But the flavor of people I enjoy are the hardworking driven nice ones. They wouldnt gossip about me behind my back nobody cares enough to do that. But I would feel like such a charity case. When I'm doing okay it's okay. When I'm not I hate the thought that I'm forcing my prescense on these people. That my attention to turned towards how shitty and empty I feel all the time and not the other spicy things that give life flavor.,Personality-disorder

50767,must bargain with the universe for social plans so my 18ftm coworker evilyn 19f was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house. she said she'd be down and now i'm just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on SC. she mentioned having extra tickets but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15 each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets? it's not unreasonable i know if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100 platonic because we're coworkers and i think she knows i'm gay the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls. but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. another fear evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with jonah 20M our other coworker a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake let's not. as in they've hung out outside of work more than once. now i don't think jonah is the petty type but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know. rambling post but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere. this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone. mainly in my own head i have to earn outings by going over everything that could go wrong and by being of use ie giving her a ride without expecting a free ticket. yeeeah it's a lot. thanks for reading all ,Personality-disorder
51434,How can I function with unwanted thoughts that don't go away? I am 22 years old and male. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and I relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with. I spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts. Can anyone relate? How can I function like this?,Personality-disorder
51391,How much of your avpd surrounds your appearance? I've been told I'm pretty but I almost never believe it lol. I don't like attention of any kind good or bad. I noticed that I have this weird perfectionism that I have to look good for people. Ofc you want to be presentableBut I take it overboard. I won't leave my house if I feel too badly about my appearance that day. I feel like I'm offending people by not looking good. I'm pretty sure this stems from ofc childhood. I didn't care too much for looks as a kid I just wanted to have fun. But my dad would constantly judge my hair want me to change my clothes so I can look better. Every thing was about appearances with him. He would constantly look at himself even in windows while walking out in public.He'd spend hours getting dressed despite having no hair so I don't get what took so long . I noticed I've picked up the same habits. I care far too much for my appearance when logically I know most people don't care. And if they do care that's kind of weird. Are you like this? How does your appearance play into your avpd?,Personality-disorder
50642,crippling guilt from my inability to answer texts I dont know how common this is but its extremely difficult for me to find the strength in me to text people back and its killing my nonexistent social life and the possibility of ever finding love. I live in constant guiltdread knowing that I have people in my DMs trying to contact me to hang out but my fear of embarrassment and awkwardness is freaking killing me. All ive ever wanted was to belong and be able to make friends but my brain literally stops me in my tracks. Its also necessary to note that I have ADHD primarily inattentive and once I take my medication Im lucky to have maybe 30min of adequate dopamine levels to push myself and reply. Sometimes I do reply but when I go back to baseline I just want to isolate and be in my dark room. I really feel like Im being tortured by my own brain. Its a terrible feeling to crave social interaction but to also be deathly afraid of the possibility that I could ruin everything and be viewed as an embarrassment. I really dont feel worthy of having the opportunity to make friends. My SSRIs have made me so numb and my personality rarely sparkles anymore so I cant imagine anyone would want to be around someone so dull.Do any of you relate?? It feels like a mental trap.,Personality-disorder
50802,My brain just goes blank even if I want to engage I don't know if this is an AvPD thing or not but does anybody else here mostly don't speak as much during conversations because your brain just goes completely blank? I frequently find myself at conversations most of them tbh where I want to talk and engage but I just don't know what to respond at all. I catch myself saying a lot of mmm yeah it's true I agree but not something... substancial you know? Sometimes I even repeat words just to use more time like yeah yeah.Meanwhile when I observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going and it seems so natural for them. I always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than I can and honestly I think this has been proven true over time.Some time ago I created a personal system to help me fill up silences and some of the things I set myself to do at these moments where 1. just think out loud without filtering so much I read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes think with their mouths while introverts think first then decide if it's worth sharing and for us with AvPD andor SAD we mostly decide it is not and 2. look for a subject connection even if it's minimal then be like this reminds me of... and keep going about it.When I observe other people interacting I can see them using these a lot naturally I feel like a robot because I had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice but even with this system I'm still having problems because like I said a lot of times I simply can't think of anything. I don't know if this is some kind of freeze response to the danger of socialization or if my brain is just socially dumb lol.,Personality-disorder

50751,Root of avpd and lifedamaging thoughts I had M21. My problem with avpd is that it made me weak defenseless I feel like prey living among predators.My self esteem is low and I know how it can be increased it just requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear.I was bullied by two different group of people I realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness the second time I was bullied by my friends at that time initially they even respected me cause I was serious but when you can't defend yourself it looks pathetic and I even can see their perspective you just need to be more tough and confident without any reason.This experience reflected in my thoughts I was living with till recentlywhen I was a kid I thought you need to really know how to dance know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it cause how they being so stupid could think about it really it's not possible but they fuck I don't.second was about clothes hypebeasts.I thought classmates were making fun of me cause I looked weird lame. Even though it's not fully wrong I just exaggerated it on a new extreme level. There wasn't particularly anything wrong with my clothes I just couldn't understand their reaction.Third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that I missed or like there was some hidden context I was unaware of. It was a constant thought when I was with my peers.I also has such problem that I often can't decide when I should feel offended and when not it's important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag. This is also a beginning of my PPD part of personality. This kind of thinking leads to paranoia.I hope I won't regret posting this. Maybe it's the only time I can be honest.,Personality-disorder
51405,How to deal with inperson avoidance? Hi dear community!I have a question my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.And I noticed that when hes going through an anxiety episode or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.For example if he feels embarrassed or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will hide behind his laptop or walk behind or in front of me distancing himself physically while still being kind its more of a way of hiding from me when he cant actually leave. For example when we share a hotel room on vacationI did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking that he does reciprocateeven when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but Im not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it or if he likes it that Im gently being reassuring and consistent.My dear AvpdErs when feeling low do you like being comforted or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!Thanks everyone !!,Personality-disorder
51364,Professor made eye contact and I had to throw up Two weeks before my calc prof came to tell me how disappointed he was in me for my poor grades and lack of turning in assignments. It had way too much of an impact. I literally couldn't show up to the next two classes.I finally get back and he's doing standard lecture stuff talking while scanning the large crowd so people feel more engaged. His eyes grazed mine a second. I know it meant nothing logically. It's just how people talk to crowds sweeping eyes. But in that moment I decided his gaze was a glare a disapproving irritated message straight to me. I felt like a failure terrible. I left the classroom quietly. Soon as I reached the hallway I ran. I ran to the bathroom to throw up.Just a second of eye contact and it destroyed me. I hate being like this lmao.,Personality-disorder

50952,So I just started taking medicine. Like I said I'm just now getting medicine for this. I don't think I really needed medicine but my therapist has been trying to get me on medication since last year. I finally agreed to it and I took the first dose yesterday morning and the second does this morning.I have noticed no changes yet but he told me that it could take a while before anything really changes. All I've noticed is how paranoid I've been that they are giving me a placebo. I want to get the pills they gave me and open up the capsule just to see if there's anything in there but if there is then is it medicine or sugar? Maybe it's just some sort of powder that doesn't actually do anything. What if they are giving me fake medicine? Are they trying to see if I can change just by believing some miracle pill will do something? It feels like they're trying to disprove my Avpd even though they were the ones to diagnose me. It didn't help that my therapist told me that he was excited to see what I look like when I'm medicated. What is that supposed to mean? I can't tell if he would just be excited to see me improve or if he is trying to test me somehow.I don't know. I think I'm thinking about this too much. Anyone have some advice? Kind words maybe? I'm going to keep taking the medication unless something bad happens so don't worry about that part.,Personality-disorder

However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot though i still have all the BPD symptoms some symptoms like avoidance social anxiety isolation feeling less came up from nowhere. For matter of fact i stopped talking to all my friends stopped working going out date i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement and if it wasn't for my mother i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden. Sometimes i think i might be paranoid but i don't think people wan't me any harm nor i feel persecuted i'm just ashamed of myself...

51272,How do you even expose yourself to the public or gain experience when you are 30? I have been hiding from people for so long. Even when I was going to school I was finding ways to hide from the world. I got sad again and randomly searched avoidance on YouTube and one video that popped up was from this guy called Dr. K. I guess he's a popular mental health streamer on Twitch and a psychiatrist who works at Harvard.I don't really play video games anymore but I do think I have an internet addiction. Back in the day I definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people so I do relate to those who have gaming addiction avoidance. A lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me. He talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart. Now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audience's ass but on the other hand I can see a lot of introverted smart but shy types gravitating towards games. A lot of the people I knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people even the lazy ones who never amounted to anything in life.Now the part that I wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life. He mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life so they don't really struggle early in life but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed. Their selfconscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged. Anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance. What a lot of these people don't understand is that they need to gain experience not intelligence in order to succeed. I looked up Dr. K's history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in India. He came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist. So I guess he's proof that fighting avoidance works.But what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already 30 able to do? He had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was 20 and able to come back and succeed. Not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there. Again this could be due to experience and desensitizing himself but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary. For someone like me my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that.I find that a lot of success stories ignore that the people who were struggling were not as extreme as a lot of people like myself.,Personality-disorder

I tested the water a few times n sort of let her know indirectly that i liked her and things still went well. I decided to just leave it at that and left on a good note I popped by on second day a few days later i was kind of nervous n had been kicking myself i didnt give her my number the first time knowing id have to work up the courage all over again . This time after we talked for about 10 mins i gave her my number i think i came across as lill more nervous the second time but I could of done worseShe never called. i thought there was some chance because things went well but i knew was no guarentee. She was quite alot younger than me but i didnt ask ages. . Still i was pretty hurt. Thats at least the last 5 times iv asked someone out or intended too n i got rejected in some way and them situations dont come around often and always require me to overcome so much anxiety . In all honesty im pretty bitter n sad sometimes at how hopeless my situation feels i cant change alot of things and people just overlook me without giving me much of chance because they see me as a loner or some other thing i cant really change.

51165,I firmly believe undiagnosed ADHD is a big part of the reason why I have this disorder Beyond emotional and sometimes physical neglect I always knew something was different about me. And not in a good way. I couldn't relate to my peers growing up and I could never figure out why. I was always too much. Too loud too weird too emotional. I never had the same interests as the other kids around me. Which made me sad because I wanted to but never did Then there's the fact that I couldn't catch on to jokes quickly which made me awkward. My poor attention span and memory made things worse. Sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor like grab something from a shelf and I couldn't follow directions. This happened a lot growing up. People getting frustrated with me or thinking there's something wrong with me because I couldn't follow directions. This evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed. If someone was telling me where to go I'd need a visual. A map or for me to write down their directions because I'll get lost. My short term memory is so bad. I remember my uncle was giving me his phone number we were moving and he had to leave and come back but I needed to be in contact with him. He recited the numbers and I couldn't remember what he said quick enough. I just always felt like I'm slow to process things. I still am. Someone will state a fact about themselves I'll look them in the face and nod like I was listening. But I wasn't so I repeat what they said back to them and they all give me this wtf look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago. Sometimes I forget the things I myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times. Again ending with people giving me this wtf is wrong with her? Look. Yikes. It doesn't help that I think I deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria. It takes very little for me to get flustered and embarrassed. It led to me lashing out at others as a child which ofc led to me being excluded eventually. I always overexpressed my emotions and I think that was off putting to other people. When I was happy I was very happy. When I felt a twinge of sadness I was crying when I was mad I was yelling and name calling.I had overall weird impulsive behavior. I would say the most random things and make really weird movements I still do but only at home lol. I think all of these things just made others reject me because I was so strange. And to avoid the harsh judgement I started masking all of my quirks but I lost myself in the process. I went from one extreme to the other. Instead of being overly expressive I isolate myself and I come off as cold uncaring and stuck up. But this couldn't be further from the truth. I truly do care about people but I'm emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem weird Sorry for all the rants and posts lately . I'm not actually sad this time. I think I'm just coming to accept there's a reason why I am the way I am and that I'm not just inherently defective.,Personality-disorder

51566,AvPD can be avoiding woman only? I wonder if avoiding woman can be AvPD? I have avoided woman almost my whole life at some point in high school I liked a girl I talked to a bit. But never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way. Its probably the only time I spoke with a girl.

I always feel like a kid compared to others when I observe or interact with people.Another issue that would happen is the few people I found remotely on my level would ditch me after some months. I think it does not work with people if you do not objectively help the person or intend to interact with them on a physical or visceral level rather than just talking about interests or random stuff.In theory I should just go ask people if they want to play certain games but it does not feel right if people just opening up about their personal lives or bantering with me makes me feel like trash. It is absurd to me that I have to shut out 99.X percent of the population because they are better than me or I don't share their interests.,Personality-disorder
51461,I hate myself so much I met this guy on vacation and we hung out for two days at the pool. I'm a very socially anxious person but with him I felt like I'd known him for years. One night he told other teenagers that he liked me. They told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriend's here. I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. I was bullied at school for being the quiet kid in class and I would run to my parents hoping they'd comfort me. But they'd get mad at me for being so quiet and they'd blame me too. I used to go up to my room at night and sing myself to sleep someday my prince will come. Now he was finally here. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and got mad at our friends for telling me.He cut off contact with with me. I was so sad that the one person who saw me for the good I have to offer still gave it up. They broke up two months later and he looks at my social media. We're not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. Im not angry at him for being loyal. Im angry at him for thrusting me into this situation. Im sure it wasnt easy for him but I was the one that suffered the greatest. He got to choose between two girls. His girlfriend is a victim too but at least he tried to make things okay with her. And me? I had no intention of getting in the way of a relationship.

51569,I despise my mom 22m Pretty much the title I just can't stand her I never liked her ever since I was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it.Just to clarify I don't think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if it's just the order of the way I put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are MY things she isn't satisfied with the way I put my clothes in my wardrobe or when I don't do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy In the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open even this days she complain when I don't leave a gap but on that case I don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kidspeople' because I don't act or do things they do and I cant forget her 'what you gonna do with your life play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason.Im afraid of embarrassing myself in public im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because I don't think I can do it or I'll make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how I was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons I eat in my room is because I just don't want to be around her because I will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it and my dad lives abroad my ears my hair my clothes everything. She always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever I want regardless of her opinionpicks I still remember that when I was younger she would be upset and mad if I didn't wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as I said I still wear what I wear and the judgement doesn't stop at that. Her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about the way I behave WhY YoU ARe NoT SmiLing and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. She would always try to buy me stuff I don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something.When I think about all of this and other stuff I understand why im so incompetent afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. It's not all her there are things I probably could've done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now I need to find a way to get back on track somehow.Also today I pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings I stored inside. I don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling.P.S if there was another post made by me that's titled the same blame my stupid phone for this XD. Im also sorry for possible grammar mistakes don't mind someone fixin them.,Personality-disorder
50684,don't be like me little rant I was a college freshman at the beginning of covid. I was just your stereotypical introverted quiet guy who also struggled in social situations. Covid gave me THE perfect excuse to avoid anything stressful. Don't have to go to class don't have to meet anybody everyday I just drowned myself in entertainment. Eventually I dropped out of class and basically became a shut in.Fast forward to a couple years later. I have no idea how time went by so fast. Everyone is all grown up and busy people keep asking about how I'm doing at school and everytime I lie to my parents that yeah I'm going to school I did good on my exams I'm about to graduate etc. It's so fucking unfair to my parents that I turned out to be such a piece of shit. I hate what I've become just lies and avoidance. When I'm actually motivated to do something I'm then immediately reminded by the reality that no matter what I do I still wasted all these years of my adulthood that I'm still betraying my parents' expectations that nothing I do is going to undo all the damage I did to myself. I'm a mess. I have no hobbies I can share with normal people I have no humor because I don't have any experience in the real world I can't make my family happy because I don't even like myself and it shows. Sorry for the rant sometimes you take a step back and really look at the situation you put yourself in and it's unbearable. Why didn't I try harder at school? Why didn't I tell my parents the truth? Facing all these fears I chose the easy way. And it is clearly the wrong choice otherwise I wouldn't be suffering this much now. If you're reading this I hope you can learn not to be like me. Avoidance is hell.,Personality-disorder
51565,Is there anyone else here who checks off all of the boxes for AvPD but cant ever get officially diagnosed with it because your case just isnt bad enough? Im fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that Ive been able to match up to down to a tee. Ive went to therapy and discussed my issues but it doesnt seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.While Im fairly certain I have avpd my case is more mild because it doesnt completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young Ive always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didnt have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that Ive been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. Its a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I cant get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?,Personality-disorder
51516,does anyone else hide their phone from everyone or turn off the television when someone else walks into the room? Not because they are doing something suspicious but because they don't want their preferences or choices to be seen? I have the option to watch YouTube on a smart TV but instead I watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when I'm in company because I don't want anyone to see my web or streaming history even if it's something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article. I just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although it's generally harmless and boring crap.I remember being 10 years old and my brother being angry at me because I would turn off the TV and act all shifty when he walked into the room.When I was a child I would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because I would be so embarrassed. That was my first sign of AVPD.I was eventually diagnosed at 21 and again by another psychologist at 27.,Personality-disorder
50830,This disorder feels like permanent burnout. Id never felt more hated than when I look at myself. Just plain inferior. Its dramatic but sad. You cant really get through much without falling apart. Dont judge me but to me it really always gonna be like this because Ive lost hope.,Personality-disorder
50737,Sent desperate message to a family member and got 0 response. Is it okay to unsend it? My mother has a drinking problem. I dont have much contact with her as she ran away for drugs when I was a kid but have tried to be a part of her life now for a few years. She was in rehab and were now a recovering alcoholic and drug addict but then she called me the other day very drunk and it hurt me so much and made me worried. I sent a message to my family member who has the most contact with her where I said she was drinking again that I feel really sad and I dont know what to do feel helpless etc. I also sent something similar to my grandpa because hes working with her she lives in a psychiatric apt. Now its been days and Ive gotten no response. I feel anxious and regret sending the messages they probably think I was on drugs or crazy for sending desperate messages like that and therefore not responding. I want to unsend the messages but Im not sure if that would be acceptable to do or look weirder if I do that. Im considering texting my grandpa something else after unsending but my other family member I dont know that well and cant really do that. I realize I shouldnt text her again after this as its obvious she wants no contact and now Ive embarrassed myself.Would you unsend in this situation? Or any other good advice?Sorry for the rant.,Personality-disorder

Its like I had a choice at the start of my life to and I chose to have serious mental illnesses.I didnt choose this just environment where I lived caused me this.People dont really tell me this but the way they behave around me is obvious that they think that I it is my choice.,Personality-disorder
51568,How to deal with rejection when you have avpd? I feel like I'm dying like there's a hole in my chest and thoughts make me feel like I'm falling in. I'm also having very negative thoughts I'm realising I'm angry at myself for being vulnerable enough for this to happen to me. Please help if you've been through this...I see no hope. P.s I mean rejected after asking a girl out I've been talking to for months.,Personality-disorder
51209,Do you have people you can trust? It is often said that we avoid people unless we have full confidence on them. I kind of confirm that. I am more comfortable with my brother my mother my grandmother my cousin longtime friends etc. Would AvPD then be a problem of trust in the others? What do you think?,Personality-disorder

He would threaten constantly to leave and oftentimes did as a power grab when I got out of hand and then would make me beg for him back. I felt so unsure of myself.

48314,IT and anxiety I'm a software developer and work long hours sometimes. When I get a complex problem to solve I'm getting nervous and eventually had tension headaches lasting for the entire day. At this stage I cannot solve a simple problem even 1 1. My entire head is overtaken by the pressure and there is no space for other thoughts. Antidepressants provide some relief but destroy my sexual life. This is a horrible way to live so I'm thinking to start a coffee shop and resign from IT. I really love IT and programming but my biochemistry just doesn't want me to be in there.,Stress
27565,I don't know if I'm able to do that since I didn't tell the doctor the truth to begin with.

This isnt the first time something like this has happened as my dad has previous jail records and hes threatened our family before and even hit us when we were smaller.

My mom doesnt want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate Im in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really cantshouldnt so she can divorce him she only wants to wait because she cant support us by herself. If we do move I would be fine with getting a fulltime job to support my family Im already a private tutor but I only do 1hr a week for 20.,Stress
29394,He wants me to study abroad in Europe after undergrad then return and work for the government in economics. I don't mind the Europe part but I have zero interest in working for the government and am absolutely shit at economics and I've told him so. No matter how many times I express my lack of interest qualification or skill at economics he ignores me and continues to push this path.

28275,It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little when I was first diagnosed as ASD at the time termed PDDNOS as I didn't quite fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers and she had honestly stopped being helpful. Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over when I told her these solutions either didn't work or in some cases going out for a walk for the sake of it rather than with an intended destinationgoal for instance made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander without something to focus on something to distract myself it starts tearing itself apart ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past ways I've failed or fallen short and I end up worse off than when I started. So I eventually stopped going. And then eventually stopped taking my meds mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil then losing water due to burst pipes then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.,Stress

49121,I think my mom found the explicit photos on my phone and I feel like throwing up. So ive been masturbating for a few years and i started saving videosphotos to my phone so its easier to get to. I always keep them in the hidden section of my phone. Last night I forgot to hide them and I woke up and found them in the recently deleted section and other app I think she went through. The latest notification was 2 hours before I woke up so I was certain my phone was turned on. The photos themselves were just photos and videos of girls I thought were really attractive they were over 18 and would use to get off to. Now since they are in the recently deleted tab notifications were only 2 hours old and I had notifications from before 2 hours ago but before I went to sleep I had apps open which I never use and my phone wasnt in the spot I last had it.So the title says I think because im just hoping it was me in my sleep and I was really tired since some photos were perfectly fine and she hasnt said anything about it yet.So incase she actually saw the photosvideos can someone give me some advice on things like what to say do when or if she brings it up?,Stress

49335,I dont know what to do and my stress is showing physically Last month I had to make a hard decision Quit my job to save my mental health or stay there and eventually suffer a burnout thatll cause me to lash out at everyone for everything. I chose to quit because I just knew I wouldnt go long without a job.New year new hiring season but Im still herein my roomapplying for jobsalmost 50100 applications sent a week but because Im not specialized in anything I have to wait for handouts.When I eat my stomach hurts but when I dont eat my stomach hurts and I feel close to fainting. I cant sleep Ive been staying up til like 12am justapplying. I literally have nothing better to do. No money to spend so I cant go anywhere. Me and my mom need to go grocery shopping but both of us are too broke to do so but we make too much for food stamps and I was denied unemployment.I tried to smoke the stress away but that only caused me to feel like I need it so I dont lose my mind being a manic freak. I try to play my video games but when youve been literally raised by the internet and have probably seen everything of interest its just boring. I go running sometimes but then what the hell else am I supposed to do for the other 12 hours????,Stress
27338,Ive been taking 12.5 mgs zoloft for about 6 months yeah super small dose .. but it was taking the edge off i think. I decided to stop taking it for a few days to see if it was really helping.

And THOSE side effects are about to freak me out do you think it is from my missed dose? Is it possible to have such a fast reaction?,Stress

29927,He backed me into a corner in the kitchen and kept hitting me. When I fell he stomped on my face and also choked me. I was trying to hit back but he's much bigger than me. When he starting choking me I bit the holy hell out of his arm to get him off. He surprisingly did after yelling about how it hurt then went to finish packing.,Stress
28838,and now it's like he did a complete 180 and decided that I have to do exactly what he wants. I'm sure that he is worried about his children going wild as young adults like he did which is fair but frankly I've always been very responsible with money drinking and just about everything else. I've always been told that I'm mature for my age and have never been anything near a problem child. I really don't think there's any cause for him to worry so much about me and I'm terrified of standing up to him because frankly he does stuff like take my phone away or monitor my spending so I don't feel safe standing up to him. I obviously can't go along with this forever.,Stress

28078,I've been seeing the same one since then and she'd helped me process so much help me recognize and start to move past a lot of things... I went from hating and fearing my father since the incident with my sister which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues among other things to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee to being able to accept the things that happened in the past and remind myself that they are in the past and be able to interact with him again even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore. I care about him his wellbeing but... That familial bond isn't there he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff a couple days after walking out... The only time I ever stood up to him. He made some snide remark about my mother and I told him to go ahead and run from his problems like he always does and he backed me into a corner and shook me screamed over me when I collapsed until my mother came home and made him leave.,Stress
28433,My anxiety was never too bad lots of what ifs and such. But every summer I come home from school or it gets so much worse. I love school. I love learning computer science I love working on my projects. But this small town has 0 CS options for jobs so I'm stuck working these dead end temp factory jobs all summer.,Stress
48924,my future. It's my first time on reddit typing this sort of rant hope it's not too boring. I'm currently 15 I still feel like it's 2021 I keep hearing these 2 years are going to fly by really quick for context I'm in Singapore in secondary 3 from my parents. It's true and within 1 year and around 5 months I have to come up with what i want to do in the future.I gotta come up with what junior college or polytechnic I want to go to what career path I aspire to follow but I can't make up my mind. 5 years old I want to be a doctor. 10 I want to be a nurse. 13 I want to be an engineer. 14 I want to be a teacher. My mind runs in circles and I can't make up my mind. It drives me insane I keep worrying whether I'll actually enjoy what I'll be doing in the future. I feel terrible. My grades are atrocious and I still choose the most stressful topics. Additional maths pure triple science higher mother tongue and in comparison to those in my class I am at the bottom of the leaderboard. Everyday goes by and I go through it slowly and I wonder if I actually enjoy living. I dunno what to do man.,Stress
28807,At this point I've moved home living with 4 younger siblings and 2 loud dogs and I finally started a new job. I'm seeing a new psychologist and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist. My new doctor has seen me twice and already changed my diagnosis I to PTSD which not only fits all of my symptoms but includes some that I thought were just part of my personality. But since hearing this I've really been struggling with accepting the reality that I have to deal with. I have vivid and disturbing nightmares I wake up soaked in sweat freezing and crying.,Stress
29989,But Im pissed I waited to long for this like I honestly could have killed myself before they got back to me. I know theres a lot of people in the system and their funding is low but this is bullshit! The government doesnt give a shit about mentally ill people. If they did then there honestly would be way less crime rates and suicide rate because people would be getting the help that they need instead of waiting for some bad shit to happen before they get help. The urgency is just NOT there at all.,Stress
29940,But this time if she ordered me a shot I gave it away. I'm one of the only friends left who will go out to eat or drink with her and I don't want to do it anymore. I feel I am enabling her diseases and I feel extremely guilty. She is worrisomely thin and I don't think she'll live another 5 years. I honestly think the only calories she retains are from alcohol.,Stress
29803,I don't know if it was the campground or if the probably former friend wanted some revenge. All of the hotels are way out of our price range in our area. We can stay a couple of nights and our reservation at the campground ends this weekend. I will be asking for a refund of the remaining nights. I'm terrified that our kids will be taken from us for being homeless for less than 6 weeks.,Stress
29431,But this incident has been troubling me for a couple of days now. I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships.

29915,I got as far as Illinois when he ghosted me after urging me to leave in the first place. I've been going between three different friends who know I'm homeless but think I'm 19. I want to go to school get a job to buy my own stuff and get on with my life. I don't think my mom is looking for me but I still need her signature to go to school. I don't want my new friends to get arrested for harboring a runaway youth as well.,Stress

Ive hit my breaking point and Im just sobbing uncontrollably. Im stressing because Ive already had to use sick time at work this year and its only the first week the house is covered in all of my sick germs and I dont have the strength to disinfect it the laundry is piling up and the house is messy. I probably sound like an absolute baby right now but I cant do multiple days of being incapacitated. I feel like shit and cant do anything I need to get done.,Stress

28650,I'm sure that there are many people worse off than me in this kind of situation but I just can't stand this feeling anymore.

28751,It honestly felt like someone punched a hole right through me. Later in the day I texted her and we talked. I asked her how the trip went. She sounded exited to talk to me and it sounded like it would work out between us. I asked her abut her friend and if anything had happened between them and she said that nothing had happened and that her aunt was with her the whole time.,Stress
30147,I don't want to be anxious in drawing class. It's supposed to be my escape my one place where I can do what I want and be who I choose. Instead it's turning out to be a trigger for anxiety. I refuse to drop my drawing class I've already committed to trying to be an artist. What kind of artist doesn't take drawing in high school?!,Stress
27827,I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head but Im still worried because I dont have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. Its just a very helpless feeling. Thanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you.,Stress
48995,I dont know what to do. My stress levels are so high that my hair is falling out and I have to stop myself from randomly crying. Im not saying I have it worse than anyone else but Id really like help figuring out how to better manage. The meds Im on to combat my hair loss worked great for monthsbut even those arent helping as much,Stress
27477,I know I should tell her my doubts because I know she's gone through doubts before as well. But I also don't know if now I'm just second guessing because I'm just generally concerned about the future. Above all I just have no idea what to do. tldr living long distance dealing with chronic wedding anxiety and fear about impact of children fantasizing about others and hoping for insight from people who have been through similar experiences.,Stress
27832,I never thought Id be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that wont stop. I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesnt stop. I dont know if thats just because it was less than 24 hours ago and Im still just in shock? Its just a lot to take in right now and Im not sure what to do. I apologize for any formatting issues because Im on mobile sounding incoherent Im just kind of numb after all this and unsure what to do.,Stress
27903,Its becoming cyclical for me where I retreat and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened. I cant live like this. I dont want to live a lie but sometimes the lie is what keeps me functioning. My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing. I dont know what to do.,Stress

28257,It started off small but it's getting larger and larger by the day to the point that I want to cry. All I want to do is sleep but no matter how much I sleep I'm still exhausted. I sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep. I fuck up my school life by sleeping so much. Why am I still tired.,Stress
28071,The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake. This happens for hours. I forget the scientific name for this but it doesn't really matter. I've had it happen before to me but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping. Like fucking why?,Stress
27542,When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didnt help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped. I was so anxious and depressed that semester it really affected my grades. Anyway today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.,Stress
28517,Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my main account. For some background 30 yo male diagnosed with GAD depression and PTSD. Otherwise healthy but recently my anxiety has been getting worse and showing itself in the most fucking frustrating way. I'm about a year and a half out of an extremely toxic and abusive relationship. I don't want to go into the details at this point but that relationship shattered my trust in people and frankly myself.,Stress
28586,The problem is is that the kinds of mistakes I have made are the ones I can't even fix because I won't be on shift to. I don't know what to say to be helpful and to diffuse tensions. I am pretty sure all of my coworkers hate me. Just like everybody always has. I have already had panic attacks 3 different times at work now.,Stress
49105,I am super stressed because my reputation at work has taken a huge hit and it's affecting my work I graduated with a masters degree and joined my place of work exactly a year ago. This is the first job of my life and that made it little difficult for me to get a hang of the corporate life. However since I have a master's degree the expectations were high. I made a lot of mistakes last year one of which was that I didn't pursue good development work aggressively. Whenever a senior told me that they can not trust me with development work right now I accepted it and hoped that they will see my efforts. The concerns of my senior was that I won't be able to understand development task by myself and even if someone explained it to me I won't complete it before deadline because of my lack of skills. And because of this a perception has been created in everyone's mind that I miss deadlines and that I only complete basic tasks. Since start of 2022 I have been trying my best to change the perception. I am taking on more tasks as well as completing them on time. However if I make a single mistake the views of my senior and manager changes to me being undependable. I am being micromanaged because no one trusts me that I can complete the work on time. And that's not it. I have also been given a warning of being put on improvement required. I am very very stressed. I don't know how things have gone so wrong in just 1 year. I am trying very hard to prove myself but all my efforts are going to waste. Plus this stress is now affecting the quality of my work. Please help me out,Stress

Im an author and writing has always been my stress outlet and lately its like I cant write enough to keep the stress off me its gotten to the point where I cant get comfy and Im just anxious and feel like shit. Normally I just kinda deal with my stress when I have time but the way its making my stomach feel and how week my legs are its making it impossible to help with my kids and Im really irritable and its now effecting my partner. Were trying to move out of the inlaws on a single income with 2 kids 6 months and 3 years old while I work a new job that I just started last month which I love but its all getting to me really bad. I eat way too much and make myself feel like shit me feeling like shit makes me anxious which nukes my appetite and then I cant eat at all and then I feel sick because I cant eat.

I chose her initially because she was covered by my insurance less because I felt like she was the right match. Do I stick this out?

Its also her place so Im scarred she is going to kick me out she has used that against me in the past it makes me feel very vunrable and scared.,Stress
29436,I can't tell if that's me being a toxic person or not and I feel guilty for feeling relieved. We were such good friends once but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing the things that made us friends for years. My anxiety has muddied the waters and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault. Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me. Maybe I should have been the one to grovel because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.,Stress
48859,Anyone here doing school while working fulltime? I have two jobs and am finishing up my degree. There is never anytime where I can flip the switch off and relax.

28963,The prospect of this has me utterly overwhelmed right now though. I apologize for the erratic train of thought in this post I'm honestly at my wits end and thought it would be worth reaching out on this sub. Even if you can't help me financially any sort of aid would be helpful. I'm going to be on my own for the first time so any household supplies you might even have laying around that you could donate would probably be helpful. Even advice or resources would be great right now.,Stress
29492,Trauma changed the trajectory of my life. But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded. My ex and I broke up because he never liked to leave the house even for daytime activities. I wonder sometimes how I am going to feel when I hit middle age. Am I going to feel like I do now?,Stress
29883,I made a mistake as a result of being shaken up. Now she has complained to my boss but has falsely amplified my one mistake into me being absolutely negligent and incompetent. I found out about this 8 hours ago had another flashbackpanic attack and my heart is still pounding. I've convinced myself I'm going to get fired. I know I need to go back to counseling.,Stress
30029,i quickly think to check them all out in seperate windows and i confirm again that all of the profiles had been made very recently within the past month even up to the day of adding me. it's becoming really annoying having these profiles add me and it's just weird that they're obviousy fake but why so specifically pose as a certain kind of person and add another? stuff about me im a lesbian so don't date older men and i've never really hung out with anyone older than 40 so i know i can't actually know these people. and if its some weird joke i have no daddy issues my dad is still around and its not really a funny joke its just weird. i also note that one of the profiles which has since disappeared was really REALLY creepy.,Stress
48893,Having a hard time This is a vent to help myself destress? Lol! For the past 7 years that I have lived in my current city I have unfortunately moved from one lousy situation into the next due to thinking it was a good idea to move in with friends to help out my crummy finances and needing cheaper rent. For the past almost 3 years due to the pandemic and other situations I moved into a rooming type housing situation which for the past 2 and a 12 years me and my dog did have full use of a basement to ourselves. Last July my company announced that they would be laying off around 40 people myself included. What my stupid company didnt bank on was supply chain issues with getting key integral parts to operate equipment so they kept delaying our end of work date for the past 12 months. When I found out that I was to be laid off a year ago this July I stupidly told the lady I rented my basement from about the news but seeing how at the time my company didnt announce when our actual end date would be due to supply chain issues she took it upon herself and guessed that my end date would be around May of this year and I will have been moved out so she went ahead and rented the basement out to a family of three. This was a major jerk move on her part. Seeing how I am really strapped for cash and couldnt afford to get another apartment for me and my dog with not knowing when I would actually be moving out she offered for me to move into her sunroom this past May until my end date and she she would move her mattress into her living room to sleep in. My company finally announced that our end of work date would be at the end August this past May and I unfortunately have to stay on working and living where I am due to those reasons. Seeing how this past year has been touch and go with NOT knowing when my company would announce this end of work date and with not knowing when this opposed announcement would be happening I thought it would be stupid to move somewhere else and have to sign a lease for however long so seeing how I live month to month here I chose to stay. Since moving into her sunroom it has been a friken nightmare. She consistently picks on me and flat out accuses me of doing things that I havent done. I am not allowed to flush the toilet unless its brown she accused me of killing her precious plant I have to keep the sunroom door shut during the day so that the heat doesnt come through the whole housefriken stupid stuff like that. She has gotten a bit too overly attached to my dog as well and drops stubble hints about how happy my dog is living here my dog and I will be relocating to another province to attend school so I can upgrade my current skills at the end of August. Just this past Wednesday my friend got word that she has to go work out of town this week so she offered for me and my dog to go and stay at her place to get away from the madness here and also mind her cat. When I told the lady this she mentioned how this wouldnt be a good idea and how it would disrupt my dogs routine with living here and how it is probably super hot at my friends apartment meanwhile she has no air conditioning here. The first night there wasnt so good because my dog was in unfamiliar area and she was all nervous and panting a lot. My dog has done this many times before when camping or going away for a holidayso I got her some calming spray to see if that would help. My dog and I came back to the house last night because I have my car scheduled for servicing and a garage which is literally 5 minutes away from the house so instead of staying at my friends apartment we came back here to sleep last night for getting to the garage would be way easier in the morning. When we arrived back last night the lady in question was like ohhh she is so happy to be back of course she would she is in familiar surroundingshowever seeing how well be moving at the end of August and staying in hotels over night and other friends placesstaying at my friends apartment is a good trial run. When I mentioned that to the ladyshe munched up her face as if to say ohI dont like the sounds of this. So I am at the point with waiting for her to literally say to me why dont you just leave your dog with me and that is when I will snap. Thanks to all who read my vent,Stress
48717,Can stress cause missing hunger cues? I know stress can cause a lack of appetite but can it cause hunger signals to disappear entirely?I have been dealing with an extremely stressful situation lately on a waiting list for therapy atm. The stress has been making me feel Ill mostly low energy soreachy headaches and stomach pain. Im used to losing my appetite when stressed or grieving but with this situation I havent even been feeling hungry. Like Ill go straight from fine to my stomach hurts and is growling from being empty with no warning. At the point when my stomach starts hurting I force myself to eat something but it is difficult since my appetite is gone so nothing sounds good and it seems counterintuitive to eat when I feel nauseous. When I am able to eat it is much less than I normally would. Is this a normal stress thing and how can I deal with this without making myself sicker or ending up with an ulcer?,Stress

I'm tired of watching my back tired of traveling to places I don't feel safe tired of reliving that moment tired of being triggered tired of the stress tired of anxiety and knots in my stomach tired of irrational thought when triggered tired of irrational paranoia. I'm exhausted and need a break but know it won't be enough until I journey the long road through therapy. I'm not suicidal at all just wishing this pain and misery would end to have my life back again.,Stress
48534,New years stress Hi! I just need to tell this to somebody. 2023 is going to be ond of the hardest years. Probably not the hardest but like really really really hard one. You know in november and december I was so calm and not nervous but with the strike of midnight I dont know. Its just I had to organize my moms birthday today which was succes I guess in 2 weeks I have a prom then I need to have good grades for being able to do the maturity exam Final exam you end high school with then writing the exam speaking part choosing university going to university. Omg so many important things in one year. Is it just me or did also anybody else felt incredible pressure of the new year duties right with the strike of midnight?,Stress
28145,I'm not mad but it makes it very hard to compete as I'm quickly figuring out that my school was fairly easy and I did not try very hard. Which yes it is my fault but I didn't think I was going to have to compete with the best of the best. Just know the course well. I have always been able to apply myself endless amounts of will power with a drive to learn. So yeah I thought I could learn what I needed to know but it's more than that it's knowing EVERY little fucking thing about everything because that's how much everyone else knows.,Stress

Its not selfish I am just tired of suffering every single day. what is the point?,Suicidal
9777,I M20 had to end things with my girlfriend F20 of 1 year. She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something it would have been way easier to move on because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her we even said I love you to each other. We truly loved each other we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together I would really feel like I would lose her forever the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore movies video games exercise nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys and even though I know she is not that kind of girl it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her it would finally kill me.The worst part is I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back and she has her own life somewhere else now it really cannot happen at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen and I keep telling myself that but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TLDR I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do. I cannot move on from my ex and it is killing me inside,Suicidal
15522,RantSometimes when i get even more depressed than i already am think to myself suicides is an option it gives me alittle relief to know that even if i will not or do go through with it. it is always on the table.

14826,I am 23yo male. I never had a girlfriend. Girls never saw me as a man. They never thought about me as potential boyfriend. I was never good enough for them. I always lacked something. I never had this thing. I am so fucking done with it. I hate that sociaty came to this. Social norms matriarchy combained with era of tinder made it impossible to guys below average to have happy life. I fucking hate women for what they did to me. They always rejected me or friendzoned me. I am so full of it. I am done. I cannot take it anymore. I hate this world. All i can do is get drunk like I am rn. I do not want to live like this. All i know from girls is rejection or friendship fuck them. Fuck you are cool guy? fuck you will find someone fuck I want to still be friends and only friends. Women are so fucking privilaged.I want to kill myself so bad. It will never be better. It will never be fucking any better. I will never make up for lost years expiriences and things i lost.

9316,Despite being 100 pounds overweight Id always held out hope I could eventually straighten that out. Plenty of folks have done it before it is something that seems achievable.Even though I have been stuck one class away from a degree I have always believed I could eventually get it. it is just one class. Just because I have failed it twice before does not mean it would be forever.But socially I am just stuck.I have no hobbies. I have no interests. I have nothing with which I can start conversations with others much less sustain them.And what hurts is that I just cannot make friends. I always feel like I am helping others but then I am told it is just annoying. Not necessarily UNhelpful. Just annoying. I know others struggle with this and I know my friends are not just being assholes or anything but I can never seem to find that line. I want to be helpful since it is my only potential asset towards a human relationship but I do not think Ill ever be able to do it in a way that is meaningful to anyone.that is just todays episode though.I just do not feel like Ill ever understand social nuance. I am probably on the spectrum somewhere but not enough so in order to be diagnosed. I just hate it. I hate being so trapped mentally.I want to go away so that Ill never again be a burden to the people I care about. Well one last time but whatever. I do not feel like I can ever overcome my social ineptitude.,Suicidal
16564,I used to be very passionate about helping people. I had so much optimism and good will in me knowing that I am not an expert I still hoped that I could cheer people up. I remeber trying to put words together so they would not sound cheesy but also be understanding. Sometimes you do not know what to say. What could you anwser to a question like what is the point of it all if we are going to die anyway?? At first you get stunned. But then you say that life has it is good sides and bad times make us appreciate them more amd we should use the one shot we have at life. I remember giving such anwsers almost automatically without really thinking about it. It seemed obvious right?ampx200BFlashback to now I had a suicide attempt 3 months ago and got stuck in a psych ward for a while. I got out by not speaking about my thoughts I guess doctors thought that if I do not talk about something I do not think about it. But to be honest suicide never left my mind. I think about it every day. I want it. I crave itampx200BI got results of my end of high school exams. I did very well far better than I anticipated. The moment I saw the results I realised I hoped they would be awful. That way I would have an excuse and more bravery to end it all I am not sure why I am writing this here. To be honest attempts at trying to comfort make me sick. I feel like puking every time I see another You matter . Even those of you with the best intentions will be able to write a comment like I know it is hard it will be better. Blah blah blah which will make me roll my eyes. Even if someone means well how can you not get annoyed hearing the same things over and over?ampx200BIn a week I am going to another psych ward. I have exactly 0 faith in it. I have been going to therapy since I was 4 my number of therapists has entered double digits. Truth be told therapists do not have any magical recepies for fixing you. You hear from them the exactly same bullshit you would see if you googled motivational quotes for depressed peopleampx200BI guess the only reason why I am writing this is because I cannot really talk about it to my friends. they would mean well and tell me the same things as everyone but I really do not want them to see the type of anger those cheesy lines invoke in me. Tonight I will probably tie and untie nooses out of boredom whishing I had enough courage to try againampx200BIf for some crazy reason any masochist will decide to comment on that post I am sorry in advance. I will be very angry and irritated because everything you can say I have heard millions of times. you are better off spending your energy on someone else I used to be a supporter like you guys. it is a lie though,Suicidal

25692,Why is it that no matter how long someone is been suffering or how bad it is for them it is still stigmatized? If your suffering is to the point where you go against basic survival instincts people still think of it as the worst you can do? I mean take my case for example I have had to start over socially more times than I can count and this time I have not spoken to anyone I am not directly related to in over a year so no one would miss me and even if I did meet anyone new they would just be out of my life within a year or two for one reason or another I have not been able to get a job in over a year so once covid relief dries up I will have no income my grades are not good enough to get me into grad school which I need if I am going to have any chance at success in my field so even if I manage to pay for my undergrad I have no future I have no reason to stay alive and no hope that it will get better so why despite all of this am I forced to live another 5060 years in abject misery? would not it actually be kinder to end it early than to drag it out? Why is suicide so immoral?,Suicidal

I have been diagnosed with OCD and am experiencing some symptoms of depression. I think about suicide daily just because of my intrusive thoughts. I am going to contact a psychiatrist tomorrow but I still have to live through today. I cannot stop crying. My boyfriend currently requires his alone time and I am severely worried about him because this is basically the first time he has done that. But without him all I really have left is just my bed my computer and random people online. I have been trying to go to different subreddits or facebook groups trying to find a place I can genuinely ask for help in and just I am starting to give up and think that I am not going to find someone to talk to.I have been eating less and less because that is one way I because suffering on myself. My intrusive selfharm thoughts are continuously there. I have quite a few problems and I really just want to talk to someone about this but I lack the courage to start talking about it. I just want someone besides my boyfriend to actually care someone to talk about my problems with and also help the other person. But it just seems so hard to even start trusting someone because it does not seem like they care they do not persist or just leave it at 'I am not okay but Ill be fine'.Life is just currently plummeting down for me and I honestly need some reassurance and care from anyone even strangers online.

I have done so much work to be a better person over the years. I put a gun in my mouth the other night. I am glad I do not have anything stronger than a .22 I do not want to be a vegetable. its odd because In a way I am so peaceful but I feel like if I am such a horrible person then maybe I should not be alive.

I am still not sure why she was upset. I am horribly lonely. My partner and our two birds is all I have. I do not understand why my partner says he loves me. I am completely useless like a stupid child. I have got nothing going for me.I often think about what I would need to do before ending my life. I would have to rehome my birds and get rid of my things...I would not want to leave everything for my partner to deal with.

8253,A successful person can say million philosophical quotes because he achieved everything that he wanted and living a comfortable life. Most people get success in their life because they are giftedGood or at least reasonable IQ adequate confidence some important skills etc.. What about a person like me who is handicapped in everything that gives success. I work very hard but I could not be able to do things properly such as my exams presentations interviews etc. I often fail in everything because I was not born with a good IQ. An opportunity has been never given in my life and gifted people give me some nonsense lectures and philosophy on how they have achieved their success. Why do not they understand that I have a different capacity compared to them? I feel like I do not want to live anymore among the people who never understand me. Why the world does not care about ordinary people like me? Do I have a place to live among them because everyone is better than me.,Suicidal
17128,TlDR I had two back to back suicide attempts and I feel like I died after the second one but nothing is there to prove it. I feel guilty about the amount that was spent on me in the hospital and I am still immensely suicidal. I had two attempts basically back to back the first on June 1st of 2021 and then one on June 25th of the same year. Both of overdose on benadryl and prescribed Prozac. My first was alone on my favorite forest I did it at 3 pm after I got off work and drove home at 11 at night. I was grounded for staying out past curfew and the friend B I had been 'messaging' during it it was all gibberish on my part had forgotten his phone in someone is car halfway through it. he is all I have. I was terrified the first time I tried to kill myself because of hallucinations so the next attempt I did with him next to me. I got mad he stopped me and a fight broke out. We drove to a nearby park and because he knew I would taken much more before and he knew I was afraid of the cops he just let me sleep it off in the bed of my truck while he was with me. He left me three hours in because a cop told us to leave how the cop did not notice I was out of my mind is beyond me so he drove home and thought I would have left the park but I just got back in and I drove back home at 4 in the morning. Went to bed and woke up and I was still hallucinating so my mom took me to the hospital and then I was put in the phych ward for 8 days and put on new meds. I feel like I died this time. Everything feels so wrong. it is like everything is repeating itself. I do not know of its the new meds I was put on which are not helping and I still want to die or I did actually die or if I am just out of synch because everyone is tiptoeing around me because I am 'sensitive' all of a sudden. I just get moments of deja vu when I am working and it is just 'holy shit I died the last time I tried did not i' just every single time I get it it is the same feeling of 'I am still stuck even when I died. I am going to be stuck like this forever if I did actually die' each time. I just want to die. I have nothing besides the lack of romance that is pushing me and that is not even a big bother to me. I just want to stop hurting people I love and give them the freedom of not having to deal with me any more. My parents pretend they care because they have to and now I am just a waste of money again. A shitty cremation would have been cheaper and better than the amount they spent on me to go to the hospital and it did not even help me. I just want to die so bad. I feel like I died after my second attempt but I know I did not and I am still suicidal despite it.,Suicidal
25810,I have been suicidal for 2 years but my attempts were never serious.Today I arrived to the point where my mind was broken. All I could think of was that today was the day I was going to end my life.I went to the bathroom and took an entire bottle of sleeping pills and I swallowed every pill.When I finished I felt relieved. I just thought that death was going to be awesome from now on. that is when my mom called me and he told me many things. She put my sisters on the video call and I just saw how happy they were to see me. I saw the happiness in their eyes when I told them I was going to visit them soon.I immediately started to feel guilt and regret for being so selfish. I did not want to ruin my sisters life just because she was too precious to receive those news.I hung up and tried to vomit the pills but it was too late. My stomach was empty.I started to panic and I could not all an ambulance.I have never believed in God but I started praying.I prayed to be given a second chance.I prayed because I did not want to die.I just started feeling really tired. I touched my chest but could not feel my heart.I could have sworn that death was watching me in that instant. I tried to revive my heart but the blood pressure was just so low that I could have died.Everything turned black then.Now it was just me and my thoughts.Maybe I was actually dead for a brief second. But miracles happen. I woke up.My heart was still very weak but at least I came back to life.I walked so that my heart recovered.Ill never attempt suicide again.The feeling of regret that I felt as I realized that I was going to die soon is a feeling that Ill never forget.Please if you are reading this just know that there is help.Sometimes suicide may seem like the best option for you but I can assure you that when we are truly on the verge of death that is when you know your true feeling about life.I do not want to die. I want to fight life and become stronger. Life gave me a second chance and I will use it to become a better person.

20336,Since the pandemic began Im17 moved to another citytemporarily then another oneagain temporarily and traveled between these two towns back and forth for almost a year. In this time period I have rarely been in the city Awith all my friends classmates etc. and pretty much was on my own for a year. At first I thought I dealt with this isolation just fine. I am introverted after all and I just relaxed and enjoyed the peace. But after a year since the pandemic has began the solitude began to take its toll. I have felt lonely. Which eventually led me to being depressed. In the beginning of summer I was finally able to come to the city A and meet my two closestand perhaps only friends. I have been here for nine days then went to another city for two weeks and came back here for another two weeks.The social interactions with my peers which I have craved so much and have finally gotten made me happy but not for long. At some points they did not even distract me and I was as miserable around my friends as if I was by myself.I realized sometime before that nothing makes me truly happy. I have been extremely pessimistic about my future and everything really. Soon Ill go to college and the boring sad and dull adult life might begin.Anyway for quite some time I have been venting about all of this to my closest friend. Today may have been the last time I saw her before our fivetenyear class reunions. we have decided to hang outmy 2nd closest friend but it turnt out not that great.Not only did I saw more proof that she does not really care about mesmth I realized not so long ago but also she was cold. Most importantly during our final goodbyes she told me it was hard to be friends with me because of the negativity and pessimism I bring. Yeah I was already sad but that just made it worse. I am a burden and I knew that but I did not expect her to say smth like that. Totally understand and don blame her at all. My closest friend told me that it is really hard being my friend because of all the negativity that i radiate. That might have been the last time I saw her.,Suicidal
18770,I just turn 18 and i have been a NEET for like 5 years i have like a lot of mental problems so that make me unable to start conversations paying attention i have anxiety crises and i have depression and because of that i just have like 2 friends that i barely talk to them and I cannot have a job because of that many problems.My parents do not understand when i say that i have all this problems they just think I am shy and a stupid and always tries to make me have a job or start studying but I am unable to i try my best but i cannot and it really brings me down when i do my best but my best is never enough.My Brother was always the favorite from my family he have everything he want has good grades and a lot of friends people always compare me to him I am likes his shadow he had depression for a while and my family did everything to help him and that is really good.But when i said they did not do nothing and my mom even saidYour problem is not that serious as your brother's problem he really suffers you are just complain because you just lock yourself in the bedroom and play videogames all day and do nothing that is not depressed that is just laziness.I am see myself crying a lot lately my life is like a looping hell i cannot do nothing nobody help's me when i ask for help even my parents the only reason i do not kill myself it is because i have a little hope i now if anything good happen to me will be enough to me to keep me living.But i have been waiting for this moments of happiness for like years now it is really hard to keep on and I do not know when this little hope that i have will go away and I am really scared when this happens i try to say to myself that this suicide thought is not worthy and life is good and precious but as the time goes it looks more like a lie or just a fantasy.Sorry for any bad English it is not my main language Everyday is the same looping hell and i feel like a pile of shit.,Suicidal
12159,I feel like such a manchild sometimes for not accepting that I need to work to make money and that I need money to live.The thought of having to work forever makes me feel so hopeless. Its hard for me to enjoy my day after work and on weekends because all I can think about is having to go to work later.,Suicidal
17967,Everything I do is a farce and a pathetic attempt to make up for how I hurt the people who trusted me. I have been suicidal since I was 10 and should have been dead well before now. I am considering buying a gun and ending it. It will be one last time of hurting others one last failure on my part to them. But I cannot stick around only to commit even more wounds and betrayals. I am well overdue to be dead.,Suicidal
18600,Hi I met someone online and our conversation ended up with them confessing to me. They say they have not eaten for over a week nor slept.

19052,I hid my problems for years not trusting adults nor therapists then i finally cracked and got help.therefore parents do not know shitMy parents do not really believe in mental health either.I tried therapy for multiple years first therapist did not work second one i just feels physically anxious talking to.So i went to a psych examiner recently and they told me you are mentally healthy except for alot of anxiety well why do you think I am anxious? Maybe because I am being forced to get help and being afraid of being judged i hate help here so much it always backfires i just want to rest. I am so tired of being betrayed and used by loved ones and professionals.I just want help so i do not do any harm. I feel so done after hiding my problems for years i just want help please,Suicidal
18653,I am so fucking alone. All my life. ALL OF IT. I cannot live like this anymore. I told my friend I was reasonably annoyed at her and she hung up the phone and has not spoken to meI have one other friend but she used to treat me so bad that I am literally scared to talk to her because she triggers me. I know this sounds like nothing but there is other reasons I want to die too plus I cannot handle the little things nowadays eitherI just want to fall asleep and never wake up Honest to god I might finally go through with it,Suicidal
7089,My anhedonia is so bad right now I do not know what I am supposed to do I cannot concentrate on anything I cannot watch videos I cannot research random stuff I have not been able to play games for years I found out today I am seeing a psychiatrist on the 5th of August but I do not know how to survive until then no distractions are working time feels like it is going by infinitely slow there is nothing I can do please can someone just help I just need to make it until then I just want to kill myself and have it all be over Anhedonia please someone help,Suicidal
13195,I am just tired of life. I am tired of living with clinical depression and anxiety barely managing to function. Every time I think I managed to take a step forward I go 3 steps back. I keep telling myself It will get better if I work for it but it has been years and nothing improves. Trying to help others or improving myself does nothing. I am numb from feelings and the one time in the last years I had a spark of feelings was shot down pretty quick.I do not even know why I am writing here. I just want to find hope in something I guess. I am lost and tired.,Suicidal
23843,Sorry for the alt but people that still care about me use reddit and I cannot let them find out. My entire life sucks and I cannot take it anymore. Whatever I do I fuck everything up. Everything I do goes wrong. If I breathe in some bad thing happens in my environment. Fuck that. My entire life is a failure and I cannot take it any longer. I do not care about anything anymore so I will just leave a note why my entire life sucks. Doubt anyone will read anyway.I am ugly as fuck. I was born too early and I am extremely short. If I eat more than 1 meal a day I gain weight. that is why I am slowly becoming overweight. Even people who pass me on the street call me ugly. I am an adult and my body stopped aging around puberty. Guess how fucking miserable I look. I have not smiled for the last 15 years probably. Most of my friends abandoned me and if I want something from them it is always me to contact them. I do not have any special talents. Had to run away from home to be able to move out. Did wageslave jobs that resulted in permanent back pain and backbladder issues. Every minute on the toilet is painful as fuck. I spend the entire day in front of my pc and the back pain is so strong that I need extremely strong painkillers that are almost like drugs at this point. When I take them everything feels like I am on a drug trip and I start to enjoy it but I am useless for the rest of the day. Alcohol also makes me feel good but I cannot always afford it. I will never be able to have a relationship anymore because my first boyfriend abused me and locked me in his home my first girlfriend cheated on me with my ex boyfriend. I cannot even watch porn anymore because PTSD kicks in. Horrible right? And recently I realised that I am trapped in the wrong gender very likely. If I look in the reflection in the mirror I do not feel like it is me. I do not even know what I am at this point. I thought everything would be better if I join uni but I keep fucking up my minor. I am below average in my major and can pull through but my minor fucks me. I failed at least 2 classes each semester and if it would not be for covid I would have already been kicked out. I am now taking a minor class for the third time and I still got 0 points in the mock exam. I fucking suck. I hate myself for going this way. I feel like a fucking retard doing a class three times. And this is supposed to be a freshman class. It will only get harder. My uni however has finally given me the chance to escape this cruel world. I get to study abroad and they pay the tution fee. This is my chance. In 2 months I will fly to a different country quit all my insurances so you cannot take me back! I will probably cut my veins in a public toilet and die a miserable death. Nobody will find out if I have died because everyone excepts me to be gone for 6 months. My death will never be announced to them because I am in a different country. Because I will burn all my public documents nobody can identify me. I will be missing in action forever. it is only these 2 last months and after that I am finally free. I just need to pull it off. Just 2 more months and I can finally leave this world forever. do not mind my short rant.,Suicidal
11483,I went to a hospital in March after an attempt. Life has been a living hell then. I made a friend in there who became super attached to me fast only to ditch me in a few weeks and start dating someone with my same name. My dad has become so detached from me. He did not even come see me on my birthday. I lashed out at my best friend and lost her. My mom has become meaner. I keep trying to move out of here and failing. I just wish I died I wish I fucking died why did anyone stop me I hate my life so fucking much I hate all of this shit I want to fucking die I do not enjoy any of this and what is the point I am going to suffer and be alone forever I hate my life I wish someone could just kill me Life has been on a downward spiral ever since I was stopped from committing,Suicidal

17649,Its just been a rough 7 years of just being on the edge. At first it was easy I felt like the promises to my friends would be enough. then the thoughts kept coming and Id try to handle it. Each time it wore on me and I think along the way I just felt or feel broken. Toxic relationships to toxic people have been my teachings from my parents down to me. I know I should not ponder the past too much but fuck it sucks trying not to be something and just end up in that spot and ruin everything that could be my salvation. I have tried to kill myself a couple times coming close to too intoxicated or getting talked out of it. My biggest fear was getting forgotten. Currently though I feel the tether to these promises thinning. I am tired of fighting it I am exhausted. If there is a afterlife I hope its like floating in ocean null of emotion. Idek if these are valid thoughts because I held this in. I just want some peace Bad spot,Suicidal
21832,Being up north in a cabin in the woods snow and pines all around. Alone trees and mountains all around. Alone. Crossing the room the floorboards creaking under foot the weight of my footprints are one last mark alive on this earth. The cold wind hitting the walls of the outside. Pulling a handgun out from the drawer in the corner. Placing it in my mouth or on the side of my head? on my temple? whichever way it is with full intentions to pull the trigger. Am I really meant to stay alive? Was told to stay alive but for what? Only to create more misery? The ones who have said it disappeared in the wind. To stay alive to not exist? To live only to wish to end this misery wishing to end this thing called living? We all meet the earth in our deteriorating bones eventually. I have no legacy. I will be forgotten like the ones before me. I think these things as I am pressing the ball of the barrel to my temple. I think of him who first said to me to stay alive even though he disappeared and said to never call back. Why am I still here? I want to cry to scream to take this pain away. Am I really going to give in to living or just end it all? TAKE THIS PAIN AWAY! End MY MISERY! I lower the gun and fold into a ball. The gun lay at my head the gun laying in full sight. I stare at it conscious of the outside the wind shifting frame of this cabin. I close my eyes and pray I no longer want to be alive. To fall asleep. To wake up alive. I want to die! Am really meant to be alive? I have no interesting tile but I hope someone reads this relates to it. Maybe enjoys it.,Suicidal
24439,21MA couple weeks ago now was my latest attempt to end my own life. For years my mental health was stabilizing getting better each and every year. Then this year with the pandemic relapsing depression my girlfriend breaking up with and a new stressful job has led me down a very dark rabbit hole that has gotten out of control. Then I finally tried taking my life again. I was found by my parents hanging from a tree unconscious and losing my last bit of oxygen. I was taken to the hospital literally just in time where I got tested and treated for my injuries and then held for my own safety for a week. My life is back to normal now but...I want to try again.Last time I did not have a note prepared now I do. I bought a new rope And now I stare at the rope for tens of minutes before something else distracts me.I want to die so badly... and I do not know what I can do anymore.I do not have enough money or insurance for counseling or medications so I do not know what direction I should go towards. Also none of my 'friends' are serious enough people to where I can to them about what I'mIt feels like such a pressure on my chest that only death can get rid of.I am so sick of the typical it is selfish or people will miss you arguments since it is obvious at this point I do not give a fuck about that. I know it is bad to think that but it is REALLY bad right now.I feel so lost guys... I might just actually try to end my life again... I failed my attempt but I want to try again.,Suicidal

25133,Id be lying if I said I have not been thinking about suicide for a while now. Growing up black gay AND muslim my life has been beyond miserable in the sense everywhere I go have to worry about if people are going to be either racist homophobic islamphobic to me and my family being poor and extremely conservative demanding muslims does not help at all. It just feels like my lifes a constant struggle and having a traumatic childhood and highschool experience that made me lose a lot of self esteem and confidence really fucked me up. I always feel this looming pressure to be someone I am not and it just stresses me out. Why did I have to go through this life it feels like there is no going up from here and I am only 18. I cannot stand living on this earth any longer and my thoughts throughout the day just consist of trying to minimalise the importance of my existence so that it would be easier for me to leave this world. I have been having these thoughts for a while now and they just get stronger with time. Is there anything I should try doing before I completely end it all? Suicide feels like my only escape,Suicidal
26412,I cannot live any longer. Was planing to kill myself since last year. My plan is cutting my wrist. I saw on some movies maybe it is painless. I cannot find a gun hence i decited to do this way. Sory for bad English Does it hurt to cut your wrist?,Suicidal
25056,I would like to start by introducing myself my name is Zen. And I have dealt with suicidal thoughts my entire life as long as I could remember. In my earlier years I never really had a reason for them but I still had them. It was not until high school that I started understanding the thoughts I was having more. I was never able to get them to go away but when I would feel them I would feel like I had my own reason why behind it. It was not until after high school that the thoughts grew into more serious and detailed descriptions of acts that my brain would actively play for me as I would think about them. And it is not until now that I begin to truly ask myself the RIGHT question.Is it more important to live and percieve well OrIs it more important to HAVE lived and percieved well. Is it okay?,Suicidal
23127,I am new to Reddit. My eldest son was always sending me links to stuff on here that he would found interesting and Id end up in a Reddit rabbit hole every now and again but I have never posted anything. So 3 months since I found my eldest son. He had taken his own life. He was 22. Since then my world has pretty much fallen apart as you would expect. I have 2 younger children and a partner we were actually separated at the time my son took his own life but I have not been in a great place and hes stuck around. I always thought I was a good parent. My kids are smart funny well mannered all round balanced kids or so I thought. I have never been suicidal until after this. I am overcome by guilt for not being able to save my son. I attempted suicide after his funeral. I feel so bad for my younger children but this feels much bigger than the love I have for them. When my son was small I had a partner who lived with us he was a great guy and loved the kids but there was no spark for me. I was young myself and I asked my partner to leave. A few months before he died my son mentioned to me that he always blamed himself for my partner leaving because he saidhe had asked if he could call him dad and Id said he could. I told him I did not remember this but of course it was never his fault and I was sorry I did not make that clearer to him at the time he would have been 6. So over the years its mainly been me and the kids and I dated guys but it never amounted to anything. The kids never wanted for anything I went to uni and got a good job and we always had holidays to nice places etc. I was proud of my kids how Id managed to bring up such amazing kids on my own and I never really minded being on my own. So now after this I feel completely responsible. I did not realise my son was feeling this way. We worked different hours so usually communicated by text but this was every day. We had a lot in common and we got on well and had always had a good relationship. Since he died I have found out that he told an ex girlfriend he had suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts all through his teens I never knew this. I feel like I have completely failed my son and also his younger siblings. I feel like now if Id have stayed with my ex partner all those years ago the kids would have had a father figure and someone around who loved and cared for them I am addition to me. I am almost certain he would still be alive. I feel like my immature decisions when I was younger were selfish. It was not intentional but I feel that the fall out has been massive and now there is nothing I can do to fix this. I think about ending my life most days because I simply cannot live with guilt of what I have done. I was always a really positive person. I always thought no matter what went wrong in life I had my kids. Now I feel that I have completely ruined not only my life but theirs and in a way that cannot be fixed. Family and friends have not been in touch since the funeral and I do not really feel this is the kind of thing anyone could understand. I feel a weird kind of calm when I think of not being here any longer. I have completely ruined everything.,Suicidal

7353,I left my job recently where i found out my boss was seducing his teenage employees a couple years ago I dropped out of college because I was having severe mental issues like depression delusions hearing shit in my head bad relationships had quite a few shitty jobs that treated me like shit abandonment issues from friendships and family relationships through the years... idk it is all just coming forth in my mind all at onceI cannot get myself to see a therapist because I do not want to start another relationship with someone and try to dig into shit when I just want immediate solutions. I do not see a future for myself everyone fucking hates me and gives nothing in return... I ask for help... nothing. And now my career is fucking ruined from my last job... I cannot even work in the same field which is what I have been doing all my working life otherwise I have meltdowns just thinking about itI'm even engaged but I just feel like such a fucking burden.I think I am just ready. it is time to go. There are much better people out in the world that are more capable than me I am just another one to stop the chain of depressed alcoholic addicts in the food chain. Good riddance I have never actually committed to the idea of actually following through until earlier this week,Suicidal
7590,Today was the first time I really thought about suicide. I have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like i wish I was not alive to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years. But this was sort of a coping mechanism I think to deal with stress. I have been pretty successful in life and probably happy by a lot of people's standards. In general i have been pretty driven and interested. I was clinically depressed about 15 years ago but I have not had a similar episode since.However today I felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day. I did not just think I do not want to be alive I thought maybe I will not be soon. I thought of some familiar fantasy of dying but this this time it was real life. I thought about how I could enact that fantasy. Then I wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. I do not want to die painfully. And I do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. So I spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate making dinner talking to my spouse putting the kids to bed.I just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing I did to cope with how stressed I was feeling to this other oh I can do this feeling. It was so unexpected. It was just a normal day.I have never had these thoughts before and I just wanted to write it down somewhere. I found this subreddit in the course of the day and I have reddit so I thought it would be as good a place as any. July 28 2021 maybe a new era in my life started today for reasons I cannot really understand.Thanks for listening Today was the first time i really thought about suicide,Suicidal

17418,I catch myself thinking and considering suicide daily. I do not think I need a plan I could just walk to the river or take the pills from my cabinet. Sometimes I have almost done it but I never just go through it. Maybe I am a bit scared. I am also scared that I am just faking it since I do not cut or anything. Can I still be suicidal? Actually I do hit myself but i do not think that is self harm? Can I be suicidal without s3lfh4rm?,Suicidal

17195,My bf is in a terrible place. Rape victim extremely abusive family a college degree he was forced into but hates no hope about his future. Hes been having suicidal thoughts for a long time now. Hes gotten really close too. He stays because of me. Because he knows how much it would break me to lose him. But it also breaks me to see how much he is in pain. I want to help him but he will not let me. he is already seeing a psych and is taking medication. he is serious about ending it. I have put it off for as long as I could but hes only giving me 2 months left to be with him. I do not know how much longer I can help because I think I am starting to develop suicidal thoughts of my own. He wants me to just accept that he is ending it and let him go. I see how much pain he is in and how inescapable the situation he is in is. Should I just let him go? Is it ever okay to let someone commit suicide?,Suicidal
20707,For context due to trauma and mental illness I have been unable to work for about six months.I am these six months I have found society really does not give a fuck about your mental stability and comfort if you cannot work. Care is difficult to access you are constantly at risk of homelessness it is difficult to get on disability and you are discouraged to even do so for the fact the SSI system is clearly broken and pays so little.Every single thing I have used to bring myself comfort costs more money than I can currently comprehend having as I am facing years of therapy and little to no income.A non shattered phone screen from a phone I repeatedly drop due to anxiety shakes and dissociative episodes? cannot afford it.Open up your laptop to write up some of your thoughts just go get them out? Your Microsoft office subscription has expired because everything needs to be a continuing revenue stream to milk you dry.Want to watch Netflix? YouTube without ads that remind you about what you cannot afford and send you into a spiral? New shoes because you have one pair and it is been falling apart for the past year? Reup to your laser hair removal so you can look at yourself in the mirror crying. A new pair of underwear because you are somehow down to just three? Everything is too fucking expensive. And when you literally are taking no money in and facing not taking any money in for the foreseeable future every single purchase seems like too much. Some days I do not eat because my bank account is too low and I cannot stand thinking about how it is going to feel when I am really hungry.TLDR Money makes me anxious. Finances make me anxious. I want to fucking blow my brains out so I do not have to obsess over how fucking poor I am. Every time I see a news article about how rich Bezos is I want to puke. I just want to not cry about money while I am getting treatment. Everything has to cost money and everything keeps costing money.,Suicidal

10415,Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my wayout ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out hangout eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here I literally do not have anything back home. No friends no group no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life at 23 when I should be living my best years gain all these experiences and feel young I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up it is always the same pathetic record me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated highschool. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than filmmaking. Unfortunately in my homecountry there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my socalled professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs all the friends all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional maybe I have highfunctioning depression I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that. Anyhow thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated! I think I am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world,Suicidal
11048,My lifes only purpose seems to be to work to give into buying stupid pointless crap and giving away all my love to anyone?I feel so empty like what is the point I feel like no one wants to hear me anymore,Suicidal
22194,I do not know if anyone else feels this way but I thought I might share.I am an incel with literally no friends no money I have never had a job and I have crippling anxiety. I am convinced its almost impossible to make new friends if you do not already have any its not as simple as just meeting new people. If you do not have other friends already people sniff it out from a mile away and then keep their distance. And the same goes for relationships.I am far to anxious to get through a job interview I know if I try Ill just have a panic attack and make a fool of myself.The strange part is that at this point I am not even sure if I could consider myself depressed its just that I hate myself constantly.Despite what poor shape my life is in I know I am defiantly capable of turning it around. What I mean is I know its not statistically impossible for people like us to sort ourselves out even if the odds are harshly stacked against us. Incel no friends no money no purpose.,Suicidal
14975,When I was 11 I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety. As I got older my symptoms grew worse as I suffered under numerous traumas. Bereavement of a parent via murder. Emotional abuse by the other parent. Neglect. Rape seeing someone die right in front of me and being abandoned aged 15.I was highly traumatised by these events and was diagnosed with other mental disorders including complex PTSD. I went to a small school for children with mental and behavioural difficulties. Until I started college at 16 I had no education beyond primary school age. So I was 11yrs old when I stopped being educated.I was still put through for Maths and English GCSEs despite the lack of education. I got a C in English and an F in maths. I still do not know why the fuck I thought to do a mixed construction and engineering course at college just months after failing maths The sad truth was I was only picked to do that course because I was 1 of 4 women out of over a 100 boys in that department. Nobody else in my class had below a D in maths most had ACs.I did maths in my first year alongside my Level 2 course and failed. In my second year my now level 3 course with the help of a very kind teacher I managed to get a C in maths.During my actual course I struggled very hard. 4 non practical exams and a few practical ones. I was weak and I would never even held a drill in my life but I tried so hard to learn. I would cry before and after my practical day which was a Tuesday. My teachers did not know my full background obviously but I was severely scarred all over my body from obvious self harm and my uncle was my next of kin so it was obvious I had not had it easy. I would come in 2hrs early and I spent the summers working in the workshop to learn more. I barely passed in my first year. In my second year I did well. In my 3rd year I was in the top 3 of my class.In my second and third year I volunteered at a local charity shop every Saturday. I was helping with general stocking shelves and talking to customers but I was contributing to helping this private charity taking care of abused dogs. I felt confident enough to study a particular niche type of engineering it was a university course.I dropped out within 2 months because I could not cope. Different teachers much harder work different classemates. And the development of a very painful chronic pain condition.My life spiralled. I was running out of money and was too ashamed to go onto benefits so I attempted suicide.I went onto benefits eventually. I was finally diagnosed after months of going to the drs with pain and being told to just take ibuprofen. Eventually after moving to a different GP surgery I was referred to a specialist and given painkillers. it is been 3 years. I am on PIP and universal credit. it is took 3years of being under a psychiatrist and being given all kinds of antidepressants and an antipsychotic to actually be told I need therapy. Took 3years of begging before they referred me to a psychology service. I am starting EMDR next week. I am waiting for treatment after waiting years for the pain clinic to suggest a course of action.Yet I hate it. I judge myself and those around me judge me. I am a burden on society. I have never worked an actual job. My anxiety that I spent years working on is so bad I sometimes cannot even leave the house. My self harm started after I stopped for years. I am on so many medications that many drs have expressed concern. I am diabetic which they think is related to my untreated PCOS and that I spent years on a particular antipsychotic that can because it. I still do not know what type I am. I do not even care anymore. I pay pre payment card for my mountain of prescriptions because I feel too guilty and ashamed to tick the universal credit option.I hate how my life has turned out. And I am too sick too anxious too depressed and traumatised to change anything I am 23 and a burden to society,Suicidal
23010,I almost took my life not even 24 hours ago and no person in my life will know. I internalize my pain so much that I cannot do otherwise. I wrote my suicide note and it said Life is beautiful PEACE LOVE AND FREEDOM because to me that is just what matters in the end of the day and in the end of my life. I am only 20 and I am on my 5th suicide attempt. I have diagnosed CPTSD clinical depression with psychotic tendencies BPD and bipolar disorder and maybe I am schizoaffective but my doctor is trying to find a way to tell me about it in a way that will not make me panic or be sadder. I can tell in the way he asks me questions and the way he talks to my mother that he tries to find a way to let her know too without making her panic or be sad. I know I need to get hospitalized but I cannot. I will not tell anybody about why I believe so but I say so because I am in the verge of an actual serious mental breakdown not the one that people make memes about. I am close to going to my job and throw all of the high end luxury desserts that take hours to make on the floor and start screaming my lungs out of fucking nowhere and just run outside and start running I do not think I will because harm upon anyone but if I can even slightly feel that maybe I will then I absolutely WILL go to the hospital. I just want to be put on sedatives and sleep all day. I want to feel like I am dead. I want to feel as if I do not exist anymore. I want the feeling of no one remembering me or thinking about me. I just want to be no one I want to cease to exist. I want to cease feeling and hurting and mania and psychosis and crying loudly and panic attacks and anger and rage and sorrow and desperation I do not want to feel all those shitty feelings anymore. I do not want my memories anymore. I have CPTSD because I was raped three different times by different people. I have flashbacks sometimes not as frequently as I used to. But when I do I scream and cry and hit myself and I just cannot be reasoned with and calmed down without sedatives. I cannot have sex with my boyfriend. Everything reminds me of it. The third time it was very violent. I got beaten and bled out of my ear. And that is why I hate bathrooms with green tiles. My doc says we can try EMDR and we sure can. He says we can try the electricity therapy which the name of I do not know in English. We can try ketamine therapy and SSRI antidepressants and all those other new methods. Although I am done for. I do not think I can be saved. Keeping me from taking my own life is selfish at this point. I ache so badly I feel so fragile that I think if I walk out the wind will take me away and I will scatter like dust and sand. My body is so frail I slowly become weaker and weaker each day physically and feel like I need help with basic self care. I cannot eat food. I do not want it. I just cannot even swallow it. My body does not allow me to give energy to myself. Yet I wake up every day at 5 am after working for 17 hours the previous day to get shouted at and belittled. And I work for all these hours with no breaks and no complaining. Today I cried in front of everyone. I have a sort of intimidating appearance I have tattoos and my haircut is extreme and these people must have thought I am some badass but I am not. I cried today after attempting to take my own life a few hours before. They will never ever know. No one will. Soon I will die in my own terms. Because this life I just cannot take it in MY hands and do something. I am unable to because I am a weak little fucker. Thank you for reading. I hope your day is lovely. Idk,Suicidal

7889,I go to a clinic and get psych meds see a psychiatrist and a therapist. The therapist only does talk therapy and avoids major things that have impacted me like the sexual abuse I suffered as a child various other traumas the bullying. Just ask me about the week and never really offers anything helpful. This has been every therapist I have went to that Medicare covers. what is the point of more therapy and what is the point of this hellish existence. I ready to move on now. I no longer care. Real therapy cost money I do not have? what is the point?,Suicidal

17628,Iam a 57 year old male race does not matter. For many many years I have been a big advocate of NONSUICIDE. I would see someone on the news somewhere in the world had committed suicide and I would always say what could possibly gone so wrong in your life that would make you want to kill yourself ? Well my question was answered on june 2 2020 when my wife of 25 years died. then i fully understood why you would want to end your own life. She was my purpose in life and after she died I had no purpose anymore why even get out of bed ? Then about a week or so after her death a new purpose to live found me. It was about 700 am and the dog which never jumps up on the bed jumped up on the bed and just stated licking my face like no tomorrow at that moment I knew what my purpose was. It was to give my dog the best dog life ever. She only eats organic Turkey she only drinks either VOSS or EVAIN water. I take her for a walk or we go to the dog park at least once a day. No matter how tired in the evening I am I always have time for her she is spoiled rotten. I think we need each other.. One last thing she sleeps in the bed every night now. and I do not have thoughts of killing myself anymore. ADVOCATE OF NONSUICIDE,Suicidal
24370,I have a way to kill myself. I have plenty of reasons to. The only reason I have not is because I am scared. But I really just want to die. I keep trying to find reasons to keep going but none ever work. My friends leave me my passions fizzle away and life just keeps getting worse. The world we live in is going to shit and I do not think I can live in it anymore. Sorry for chatting here just needed to vent somewhere. I need a reason to keep going.,Suicidal

7309,I live with my dad and he does not love me hes been threatening to kick me out since i was 12. I am still under 18 for a few years so i cannot even move out yet. I told my mom I am angry at her for leaving me with him and for even giving birth to me and she compared me to my dad. my siblings all moved out a long time ago and barely talk to me. Noone ever helps me. I am tired of being told to stick around for a while and it will get better. I am tired. I have been looking for ways of painless suicide and the only thing i can find is locking myself in my running car in the garage or finding a big cliff somewhere and jumping I regret being born,Suicidal
18327,Why do people care so much that I stay alive? I do not want people to care I just want to die. I do not have the strength to commit suicide but I so desperately want to. What the fuck is life? Why cannot I take it? What is existence?,Suicidal
8166,What else to add? I did not chose to become pregnant and a single mother. There is more story to this but I do not want to write too much right now as it is really traumatic for meMy parents basically pressured me into keeping the child. But tbh I do not know if I would have been able to get a abortion mentally if they were not involved.I love my little one. I really do. Now it is too late anyway. I will do my best to care for my baby but I am suffering. I would honestly kill myself if I were not pregnanta parent to a child who needs me. How can I manage the pain for at least 18 years from now on? I am only 20 yo and have no friends. I just have my close family stepfather mother younger brother and it is currently very stressful at home. They fight a lot and I feel like a burden to them but I have no alternative nowhere else to go.They told me that I and their future grandchild can stay with them and they will support me. I would leave and make it easier for them but I obviously cannot make this decision bc of my LO.I have no other option than staying with them. I am financially unstable and basically a failed human being not able to care for myself and my child. I am in a very bad mental state right now and I do not know how to manage anymore professional helphospital is no option. I do not have that much money and cannot expect my parents to pay. I already was diagnosed in the past but my parents basically undiagnosed me as they know better than all of the mental health professionals I have seen in the past. I feel so bad for even having this kind of thoughts but I kind of wish I will die due to birth complications. Nobody would consider blaming me.I am such an asshole for even thinking that I know.I am so sorry my little one. Mummy is trying very hard to stay safe for you. do not worry guys. I would never do intentional harm to myself as long as baby is inside of me. I love him so much and he is the only reason I am still alive. I sadly cannot talk to anyone about this. I am so lonely.Thanks for reading. I want to stop existing but I am 33 weeks pregnant so I cannot do anything but suffer for the next at least 18 years,Suicidal

8053,Final answer to constant discomfort. After a Trauma head is all fkd up. Headaches that go from basic to piercing. They just will not quit. Just here to torture me. Lots of Therapy and they say its all up to me. Be positive. Yeah right. Nice touch to flip the game against the client. How the hell can I do that? If I could do that why would I see a therapist? To tell me I have to fix myself? A bum on the street can tell me that for free . No appointment needed. No violent methods here. Have it set up to go in my sleep. Peaceful. I was holding out to spare those around me that may be affected but at the end of the day its just you all alone and your own decision path. going to END IT. GET DAILY HEADACHES,Suicidal

22496,my town is depressing as fuck like insane levels of boring and my parents did not have a lot of money so i did not get cars and the other fun stuff out here. i ended up losing all my friends and was just depressed sitting around all day. everyone here is really really cold and mean its not like everyone says about small towns.i had a few fun years where i had friends and we hung out every day doing fun stuff but still never invited to anything and most people hated me but my parents were poor so i was not going on vacations or anything it was just us hanging out in this boring town. i came back home and it was just a culture shock from hell i walked outside today and it was friday night but everything was pitch black empty everything was closed even the bar and it was just totally dead and i could not even see. when i was in the city i could walk outside and just have crowds and trains that go to the beach and all over.i tried being as outgoing as possible since i got back. i messaged every single person i used to know off social media and everyone was just really cold either ignoring me same as always i walked around for hours and went places to eat and hung out there i tried going to the shitty bar but its all shut down for covid for some reason. i cannot even think of a single way to make friends out here i do not have a car and its just like one or two small shops and a small park.even when i lived in the big city i did not make any friends. people were friendlier but i just feel so defeated from living here for so long and i have no friends anywhere or anything I have just been doing stuff completely alone for years and i got so depressed i just did nothing but drink and smoke weed every day until i passed out and i can barely get out of bed. it feels impossible to do anything without friends and I am not social enough to be able to just walk up to strangers and became friends i just want like 23 friends.even when i had friends they were always better at meeting and talking to people and they always had more friends than me and i could get the vibe off them that they can tell I am a loser with barely any friends or does anything. i really do not think i can take anymore loneliness i get suicidal thoughts daily and i get random thoughts where it would just be so much easier to just take one step off a rooftop then just grow old be alone every day miserable having everyone know I am a loser. i already tried killing myself twice and i do tons of dumb shit hoping i diei could go on and on its so fucking bad i feel like i lost my life to my town and i have no friends and i want to kill myself,Suicidal

22673,Please for the love of god someone interact with this. I know it is not healthy but I really need it. I have been living and working these past few years in the Hopes that eventually things will be solved. What things you ask? Well I will list them off here really quickly.1. Hate my body everything about it from my face to my stomach to my dick. Everything is the exact opposite of everything I want it to be and it IS impossible to change.2. I am going to die someday and all I have ever done will be rendered meaningless.3. I do not love things like everyone else does. I do not love real people and the people I do love I cannot be with because they are not real.For years and years I have been living life off of the belief that these problems will have a solution. I have done the liberty of listing the solutions as well.1. Maybe far off in the future I will be able to switch bodies through brain transplant to something I want. Maybe I will be able to construct a robotic body of my own.2. Maybe someday they will make a way to become immortal or find a way to resurrect the long dead. And I will be able to continue enjoying the life I have loved so much.3. Maybe even further off in the future they will invent a way to travel through dimensions and I will be able to be with someone I really love.I have believed these things really I had hope. But I have had it thrown in my face. I have been told everything I have hoped for everything I ever wanted is impossible. I do not want my life to end I love it so much. But it is going to end and I cannot sleep knowing that it will. I cannot do anything knowing that everything I have ever wanted is impossible. I cannot live knowing this. Please I am begging whatever person is reading this anyone at all. I am trying anything to stay positive but I am going to die anyway,Suicidal
