34707,Trying to find a therapist! So researching online has gotten me so confused. I have health anxiety from my grandmothers passing and now every little ache or weird feeling is obviously me dying. So i need to find a therapist to help me through so I am not racking up ER bills. I see Marriage and Family Therapist and Counselors and Therapy Interns but I dont know which is right for my issues. Honestly its just the health anxiety Im looking to resolve other than that i have a pretty good support system. Any help or tips on my search?,Anxiety
34626,I think I'm losing my mind Hello guys long time lurker here. I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.It all started last summer when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test I was 20 at the time. I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. Fast forward to last week that pain came back exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days but today I saw in a stool some darkbrownish spots which I believed to be blood.This has gone too far. I have no idea what I should do but I want to get out from this dumb situation. I don't enjoy life the way I used to because of some stupid thoughts.,Anxiety
34078,just wanted to vent been having a stuffy nose and slight cough these past couple of days and just a couple hours ago I've been feeling weird with a headache and fatigue. I'm scared I'm going to get sick and throw up later and I was searching my symptoms up and diabetes is a possible condition which is something I've thought I had before. To make matters worse I ate some ice cream and nutella today when i say some i mean a lot lol rip. I'm also afraid I have heart disease or something because I have a sedentary lifestyle. I've been walking everyday for 30 minutes for the past couple of weeks but today I skipped because I wasn't feelin it. Just wanted to vent.,Anxiety

34075,Chest Pain Hello I have been experiencing this random chest pain on the left and it has been very concerning for me. It started back in June 2017 random pain that comes and goes and only last for like a few seconds or so. It happens sometimes near center of my chest to the left or upper left near shoulder. It also disappeared and stopped after a few months then came back again in October and disappeared again and came back again. I've been to the doctor and he said my heart beat was fine blood pressure was fine blood test turned out normal mostly just need a bit of exercise to lower fat. Doctor said it probably is muscle spasms but does it happen this often? It's getting really annoying and causes me to freak out sometimes.,Anxiety

35874,I hit my head on a wooden door should I see a doctor? Earlier today I hit my head on a wooden door and it hurt for a bit and got me a light bruise in that area. After like a minute or two the hurting stopped and I felt fine. After like 10min however my eyes started to feel weird like my perception has changed I'm still able to type and stuff and I'm not dizzy nor do I have a headache. I even went ahead and played a game to see if I could focus and I was fine. I took a nap to see if it would help I woke up an hour earlier and it still feels weird. I was just wondering is this something I shouldn't be so anxious about or should I go to the doctor? It might just be my anxiety playing tricks on me which has happened before but I'm not sure.,Anxiety
52662,Anxiety and Weed Hi looking for a bit of advice and experiences from ranxiety here.Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed but not excessively mostly once a week. After developing said disorder weed now increases my symptoms despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout I mainly suffered physical symptoms. In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results sometimes I get more anxious and panicky but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse depending on the day so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest I quit enjoyed being high so that would be quite the bummer but certainly not the end of the world.Thanks in advance!,Anxiety
34244,Swam at public pool with contacts I was fine swimming around but when I went home it occurred to me that swimming with contacts in for 2.5 hours in a crowded public pool is maybe a bad idea. Internet confirms this... I've been back for a couple of hours and scared I'll go blind or something now... I took my lenses out and rinsed my eyes out with tap water... How long until I know if I've got an infection?... Eh...,Anxiety

35460,Freaking Out and Anxious Please send good vibes I just turned 18 and so far this year has sucked. During my two month break from university I got heart palpitations for the first time in my life. That led to a google fest for me. I thought it was over the next day and was ready to just move on when I got really bad stomach aches and chest pain. I went to the ER and they said I was fine. I decided to take a break from school to talk with my GP and he said I just had anxiety. Its been 2 months since then and while the stomach problems have mostly dissipated I have started to notice random twitching all over my body along with headaches and some numbness in my middle finger. Today my left arm feels weak and sore. I am going to see my GP in a week but I am anxious. I feel like the boy who cried wolf at this point while I feel like something is wrong sometimes I feel unable to explain it properly. I'm trying not to actively thinking about these symptoms because I know anxiety has many effects but it I just can't rationalize that these symptoms are normal. I'm just holding on to the fact that there have been too many random symptoms within such a short amount of time for it too be some terrible illness.,Anxiety
34579,Anyone else have a fear of cancer? Not looking for reassurance because I know that's not going to help. I guess I need to ventA few years ago my friend died of ovarian cancer. Ever since I've had multiple phases where I've had an extreme fear of having some form of cancer.Lung. Colon. Throat. Liver. Stomach. Ovarian. Cervix. Uterine. Bladder. BreastIts like I jump from one to another. Right now I'm having a bad fear of uterine or cervical based on symptoms I had.This fear has caused me to have so many procedures done. Colonoscopy Xrays pap smear and breast exam granted those should be done on the regular breast ultrasound transvaginal ultrasound etc. It's so freaking draining. I'm so tired of feeling this way. I just needed to vent. Thanks for those who read this. Can anyone else relate?,Anxiety

35574,Worried about Smoke So I never smoked and always thought that was that but lately Ive been reading about the dangers of second hand smoke.Where I live EVERYONE smokes. Go for a coffee? Its in your face. Go to the bars? Clothes smell like smoke. Walk on the street? SMOKE!Im freaking out. I know its not as bad as me smoking and for years there were no smoking laws remember non smoking sections on airplanes? and most people were fine.But Im convinced Im doomed to COPD or lung cancer especially since I have asthma. Though my asthma is well contained.,Anxiety
52554,Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately Ive been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics. I wont eat something thats been already opened regardless of whether or not its mine which has led to me not only wasting food but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there and even then it takes quite a bit of effort. This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness and I cant quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.Ive only ever been technically drugged once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen twenty three now. Ive done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it its not something Im likely to do again and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink but I did do a lot of both for a few years. Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work hes unaware of this fear and threw it away despite it being completely full and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.Im iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons the main one being the irrationality of it all but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center again cant afford it as I was for depression as a minor. Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.,Anxiety
34382,I don't wanna jump to conclusions but I'm a little worried about diabetes Just recently I have started to have trouble sleeping. My schedule and everything has been a little messed up. I sleep for like 3 hours wake up and can't go back to bed for a couple of hours while I feel decently thirsty and hungry. Eventually I fall back asleep for another couple or hours and wake up not able to sleep until the next time. So after I have finnaly accumulated a normal amount of sleep I will eventually get up but I don't really feel that great but I don't necessarily feel that bad. For the past twothree days it seems to have been weird. The first day it was the same cycle except I woke feeling pretty aweful. Headache not well rested and tired. The second day I didn't really get a full 78 of rest so for most of the day I felt like I was on the verge of falling asleep if I had any downtime of not doing really anything. That night I decided I would get a full night's rest in one full go as usual. I fell asleep pretty easy but I woke up like 4 hours later having to pee pretty bad and feeling thirsty. I was able to immediately go back to bed though. I awoke 3 more hours later feeling as if I have to pee again not as bad this time BUT my thirst was pretty intense. I chugged some water went to the bathroom and gone back to bed. So I'm kind of afraid that this could be diabetes or something. I'm not overweight but I'm definitely not active. My eating habits aren't too great either. I eat good foods but most definitely eat a lot of bad foods.TLDR I'm not sleep well. Waking up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty and having to pee. Thirst exclusive to night. ,Anxiety

Then today I woke up feeling how you feel when you have the coldflu lots of fatigue body aches headache maybe slight fever not sure? Also my period started so Im feeling extra crappy. And to top it all off I failed my drivers test for the 2nd time. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I dont even know where to start. Or if I should just ask to be referred to a therapist.

34520,Fluttering Having an episode now and just need to vent. Open to advice or anything you have. A few months ago I started feeling a funny feeling in my chest. Specifically it seems to occur when I lay down after light exertion. Like walking up the stairs and plopping on the couch. My heart flutters like crazy. It will beat hard one time not beat for like two seconds and then beat really fast. I get this funny feeling in the back of my throat too. So I went to my PCP and she listened and said she heard a murmur AND a flutter. Great. So Im dying. Well she sends me to a cardiologist. I get an EKG and a halter monitor for 24 hours. Nothing shows. Cardio says its fine. Not a single thing to worry about. But I still get these things. It fucks with my head cuz I just keep thinking a healthy heart doesnt do this and I will probably die young because of this. I know these things are common but that serves little comfort when they are happening. I just worry that my heart is wearing out or something. Can anyone provide me with literature that goes into detail about how chronic palpitations are not associated with lower life expectancy? Or if they are hit me with that shit too. Im not afraid of the truth haha. I just get into this habit of checking my carotid pulse when it happens and being like ooohhh fuck youre surely gonna die this time... this is a bad one... ,Anxiety
51631,I am tired of having anxiety I am physically and mentally very exhausted right now and I tried to fall asleep but Im so nauseous from my anxiety that I really just couldnt and sometimes I just like want to feel normal so bad but I feel like I will never get there. My anxiety sucks so bad. I feel like most days it controls who i am and what i act like for that day. Today i went out with my friends and we had a good time but we ended up being outside a lot longer than we would and i got extremely cold and started panicking. We were far from everyones house and all i wanted was to go home. They came to my house afterwards and it was nice for a while but i was still feeling anxious. When they all left i felt immediately better like this huge weight on my chest being lifted off. its not that i dont like my friends but being around people is so exhausting. I hate that im like this i just wanna feel normal so bad. I get anxious so easily and it wont go away for hours. Then when im not feeling anxious i feel depressed. It constantly feels like a never ending storm or something. Like just when it starts to feel bright and the rain might stop it starts again and gets so dark. Im constantly fighting just to stay sane and its so hard. All i want is to feel normal and okay and maybe real because im constantly dissociating. I do have a therapist btw,Anxiety
51722,Just one of those days Im having anxiety at work i hate feeling this way. I took these gummies OLLY brand to help my anxiety I shouldnt have skipped them yesterday and decided to take them today. I also had a little bit of coffee to wake me up some which was not the best idea. My boss is making me do cakes which I hate being the cake decorator. I have expressed this 100 times but nothing. I have a lot to do. Its just not a good day. I guess the only good thing is I have stuff waiting for me at home retail therapy I hate days like this.,Anxiety
52605,People often say Really? when I tell them I have anxiety and I have mixed emotions about it. On the one hand its comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people dont even know I have anxiety. On the other hand it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle if that makes sense. This thing often consumes my life and its frustrating that no one knows how hard Im trying. They just think this is easy for me that I can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do. Thats not to say that I feel negatively toward the people who say this more that its just generally frustrating that people have no idea. Have yall thought about this too? Do you look at it a different way?,Anxiety
52634,I am feeling anxious about a new coworker. TW Past experience with a stalker briefly mentioned I'm sorry but this is a long one. It's a bit of a weird story but I'm hoping that someone might be able to give me advice on what to do. Just over a month ago I female cashier got a new coworker male bagger at the grocery store I work at. It took a while before we had a conversation together he was helping me and asked me what kind of music I like. I was honest and said that I like most genres and that I sometimes enjoyed listening to 20s and 30s jazz music. Then he just kept talking about old music at me for the next few days and seemed to always be distracted when it came to work. I don't like to talk much while I'm working because I feel like I mess up more when I do. So I began to feel anxious about being around him since I didn't know how to tell him I didn't want the conversation to continue every time we saw each other.Then a few days ago he randomly asked me for my number in front of a bunch of customers while we were supposed to be working. I had a bad experience the last time I gave my number out to someone the guy turned out to be a stalker who harassed me for weeks and told everyone that we were in a relationship when we weren't wouldn't stop calling me tried to turn me against my family etc. and I immediately felt freaked out about why this guy would want my number when we don't know each other at all. It felt really inappropriate and unprofessional to me. I told him that we were busy and shouldn't be having that conversation right then mainly because I didn't know how to say no in the moment and that we could talk when we were done helping customers. But he continued to ask me repeatedly for throughout the next hour or so. He ended up writing his number down at some point and gave it to me telling me when he was off that day and to immediately text him my number when he was off this is while I was talking to a customer. Once we were done with all of the customers I told him the truth that I didn't want to give him my number and how I had had bad experiences in the past that started with giving my number to a guy I barely knew. He seemed to understand and then avoided me the rest of the day. So I thought everything was going to be fine.However the next day I started noticing that he seemed to be getting more clingy with me. He wouldn't be focused on doing his job and would stick around me as much as possible. He has a habit of sticking to my register instead of helping other cashiers like he's supposed to he also seems to get bothered if another bagger is helping me and he tries to take over bagging for me immediately. I often notice him watching me from across the room. Every conversation we have is awkward. I don't initiate them because I want him to leave me alone so I can work. When he's not talking to me it seems like he isn't really talking to our other coworkers that much.But then the other day I had a bit of a scary experience. I was going on break and went to our break room. He was in there and had headphones in so I didn't think he saw me. After a few minutes I went to the bathroom across the hall. When I came out a few minutes later the room was empty. I suddenly hear loud footsteps running down the hall and he barges into the room halfyelling my name just to show me a song from the 1800s for some reason. I'm worried that he might have been waiting outside the bathroom for me which makes me kind of scared to be at work right now. I don't like being alone with him. Today I spent the majority of my breaks hiding in the bathroom worried he might bother me if I went anywhere else.I know that the anxiety I feel isn't healthy and I can't tell if I'm just paranoid from past experience or if there really could be a real issue here. I don't know if I should talk to him a manager or HR about this. I thought that maybe I should just say nothing and act less nice to him and see if he leaves me alone but I'm worried that it could just make things worse. I could really use some advice if anyone has some. Because I really can't tell if he's just trying to be friendly and doesn't realize he's making me uncomfortable or if there is something potentially more creepy going on.,Anxiety

35824,Please tell me if its something serious Two months ago I went through a bout of a bad common cold and it was gone late February. In March I was definitely fine. In April however I began to have runny nose coughing with phlegm on the first day but now its dry without a sore throat. It is really unusual for me to have a cold twice in two months and I think it might relate due to me having Rhabdomyolysis in 2017 and I think I might have either lung cancer throat cancer or leukemia... ,Anxiety
35773,Anxiety Brain Eating Amoeba Ive had health anxiety for about 8 months now Ive always wanted to post here but have always been too sacred. For me everything started with a scan my wife had and in the wait I started searching for possible causes and then started getting her symptoms. At first it was pancreatic cancer then lun cancer the stomach cancer etc. I have gotten help and have actually been partially hospitalized for my anxiety. For my regular health got an abdominal ultrasound and all clear. At about he 6 month mark I started eating persistent headaches and thats when thins got really bad. At that point I was convinced I was dying so I went to my Dr and told her about the headaches. Although I suffer from migraines and have had bouts of persistent headaches in the past she recommended a sinus x ray and a head mri just to be clear and so I could calm down. Although the mri is this coming Wednesday I have been relatively stable for about 3 weeks until yesterday that is. Yesterday I was cleaning out my lawnmower and accidentally got a little bit of carburetor cleaner in my forehead. In order to make the sting go away I went to the hose and but some water in my forehead however some water went into my nose and now I cant stop thinking about the brain eating amoeba. I live in PR so weather here is warm and I really cant function right now due to fear of the brain eating amoeba. Any advice would be appreciated. Tl DR Was doing good with nmy health anxiety until I accidentally got tap water up my nose. ,Anxiety
52485,Work and work emails Does anyone else feel overwhelming anxiety when it comes to responding to emails at work? I work in a large corporate environment and whenever I get emails directed at me or regarding tasks related to me especially direct asks my anxiety skyrockets. It normally becomes quite difficult then to respond in a timely manner that would be coherent so my responses become staggered over hours. Even then I end up rereading and rereading my responses before I send them.So my question is how do you cope with anxiety in the workplace? It has become quite overwhelming for me recently and I am unsure what to do to cope.,Anxiety

34058,My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello rHealthAnxiety!Allow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!The first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder which I thought was a tumor. Of course it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into fullblown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister's house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs embedded itself in the bowels of my sister's house and bit me on the ankle. Of course this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.My health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet again I did not die but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into fulltime paranoia that I would not escape until October.Except for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective but from a mental perspective if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication I was in rough shape. In midJuly I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now before you go into a google symptom allow me to explain what happened my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn't know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn't until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a followup with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1x2x3 sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weirdass belly button.In the meantime I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa which is now down which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.To err on the side of caution my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of and the only weird thing was my beta globulins ever so slightly out of range think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem. Wanting to be as thorough as possible the pathologist recommended a BenceJones Test for leukemias myelomas and preleukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness I stewed over it.And then something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don't want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric checkups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal only at appointments.My status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find wasElevated liver enzymes likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of testsMaybe some gallbladder sludgestoneWeirdass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on itAnd guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll take therapy different meds getting sick of tests or all three but you can get there. Don't give up.,Anxiety
33946,Distraction techniques? I suffer from extreme health anxiety my main fears being that I will spontaneously drop dead from a heart attack or stroke. If I feel my heart acting up from palpitations or if I feel like my face feels strange it will send me off the deep end. It's so frustrating that I fixate on this every single day. I would love to hear how everyone distracts themselves when they are at the peak of their anxiety. Sometimes watching a light hearted show like Family Guy helps me. A lot of times if I'm talking to a friend on the phone I won't even notice any of my symptoms which I take as a sign it's all in my head!. I feel like my health anxiety is the worst at night when I'm laying in bed and all I can do is hyper focus on my body sensations. So everyone Let's hear how you deal with it in the moment!,Anxiety

34530,Worried ive had cancer and its progressed too far now undiagnosed I apologize in advance for my sloppy writing. Im a 19 year old male and 18 last year when i started experiencing my symptoms. It was June or july 2017 and i had been starting to feel tired more often as my senior year ended. Nothing shocking since ive always been tired and i was losing sleep over stress of not knowing where i was gonna go for college or how i was gonna spend the summer. One day in the summer when i was hanging out with my cousin i became unbareably tired and felt like i was gonna pass out. Id describe it just as the feeling of having really low blood sugar. I layed in my bed and freaked out because i thought i had something terribly wrong with me my parents didnt take it seriously but instead talked very gently through it with me about how it was probably my anxiety and that did bring me back to feeling somewhat less fatigued after a rational conversation. I thought this feeling would go away during that week for sure but i felt fatigued the whole week through. Being alone bored fatigued and scared to death that whole week took such a toll on my anxiety and stress levels. After that week i started to attempt to move past it getting out and doing more physical things to try to shake it off and to also test that my physicallity wasnt degrading. Im not very fit and was never good at running but i wasnt physically diminished at all i could run for just as long and do just as many pushups despite feeling a vague fatigue. After that it was on and off but it always came back a sensation if vague fatigue and low blood pressure that would just strike me randomly. I went to the doctor a month later and all of my vitals were normal and he brushed it off as anxiety and stress related. I also wanted a blood test which returned as completely normal. So i was just living like this being constantly fatigued on and off. I eventually went back to him in august to try and get more answers but with good vitals yet again he wouldnt listen to my concerns and kept telling me it was psychological. I had another blood test which came back completely normal. Probably around september i started focusing on my bowel habits and noticed sometimes my food was indigested. So i thought hey either colorectal cancer or ibs is behind this. I got a stool test done which came back completely normal. Now comes the beginning of this year and im still feeling frustrated by my off and on fatigue without any answers so i try talking to a new gastro doctor because im still focused on having colorectal cancer. This doctor actually listens to everything i say and he suggests adding fiber to my diet. He asks me if i wanted a colonoscopy but i say no because im afraid to have one and we have poor insurance which is possibly the most annoying aspect of this whole thing because whenever i visit the doctor which yields nothing my moms stuck with a bill that almost always goes into collections anyway i voice the concern that i might have celiacs disease because i have many food allergies as it is. I get a blood test done in late january checking for sprue and some cancer markers because i voiced my concern. Still completely normal and its not celiacs. Here we are in march and my worries at an all time high. Its literally all i can think about. Made so much more troubling by the fact that over the past week ive been off balance on and off. This started last week after smoking marijuana right after waking up and having an anxiety attack im scheduled to go to a different doctor for a physical and guidance but the next available spot is fucking april 29th. Im so afraid i have some kind of abdominal cancer and its already too far. ,Anxiety

52671,Are my antidepressants not working? Ive 22F have been on antidepressants since I was 14 but Ive never felt 100 better. I switched from Zoloft to Celexa about 2 years ago and Im currently taking the max dose of Celexa but I still get pretty bad bouts of depression and anxiety at least a couple of times per week. Im in therapy so I know of a variety of coping measures that I can take such as exercise journaling spending time with friendsfamily and breathing techniques but none of those things seem to work. I dont have any major problems or stressors in my life either Im just depressed for no reason 25 days per week.Does this mean that my antidepressants arent working or do I just kinda need to suck it up? Im scared to try new antidepressants bc of the withdrawals and potential worsening of my depression so Im not sure what the best thing for me is to do.,Anxiety

35471,My dog got Lepto and now Im afraid I will have it. My dog contracted Lepto infection or Weils disease and Im so worried about my dog because its life threatening to him. The vet told me she has an obligation to tell me it could be transferred to humans. I looked up the symptoms and I dont have them but I am still nervous. Last time I had my blood checked I passed out and I am really nervous to do it again. I am pretty sure I dont have it because I dont have the symptoms which says a lot for someone who has health anxiety.,Anxiety
34805,I think my HA is back I was doing well with my HA for the past year.From my post history you can see I had a small episode in December I had a loss of feeling in my foot that lasted almost all month but I managed to stay chill my friends freaked out more than I did and that made me question if I am too chill but overall I had no panic attacks or sleepless nights or anything. I went to a doctor after it lasted over 10 days and was sure it's just my back. I was prescribed some medicine for two weeks and got better can feel my leg again. My doctor did schedule MRI for my back just to check why it happened and since I have a sedentary job and have had minor back pain here and there I was happy with that. MRI is next week. Now this will get graphic. What is freaking me out right now is my bowel movements. I noticed that my BMs are a bit weird in August I would get more constipated from time to time feeling an incomplete evacuation from time to time and I started to need to go more frequent sometimes up to 45 times per day usually I'd go 12 times per day. Since I was on my let's beat HA kick I wrote it off to probably not eating as well as I should or maybe it's stress. I had no pain or other issues and I had good BMs as well. Those symptoms did not go away I got used to needing to go more often got used to mild constipation mixed with occasional diarrhea but a month ago I noticed that I often would feel like I need to go but all that would come out would be a few thin pieces. And 1015 minutes later I would feel like I need to go again. Then every 34 days I will get one somewhat bigger normalish BM and would feel better empty for one day then the cycle starts again. So for the last few months and especially last month I've had the following symptoms Change in the character or frequency of bowel movements Thin ribbonlike stools A sensation of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement almost all the time now persistent urge to have a bowel movement also almost all the time Feeling back pain could be unrelated but it is low back pain Lately lots of mucus Lots of gas Occasional rectal pain Very occasional blood maybe once per two weeks or lessMy diet hasn't changed I eat plenty of fiber I don't eat meat or dairy. I know that as a 29yearold I should not be worried about colon cancer. I know my HA probably has made it something it's not. But I think what is freaking me out is not having a positive story for this. Like for my leg I could tell myself it might be sciatic nerve chill when my chest hurts I know it's probably GERD etc. But I don't have a nonthreatening explanation for these symptoms so I can feel my HA levels rising. Part of me is still clinging to this might be something else you're fine but part of is you know what these symptoms mean don't you. I know that these symptoms are enough to go to a doctor especially based on how long they have been there. Actually I might have been stupid by not going to a doctor sooner. But I already have back MRI scheduled and I've been through so many bouts of HA I know that as soon as my doctor will say something like let's get a colonoscopy I won't be able to sleep or eat at all. I don't really know what's the point of this post since nobody can tell me what's wrong or what this could be we're not doctors here and I should talk to mine. I guess I just needed to let it all out and know I am not alone and it fucking sucks to get HA back after a year of normal living. ampx200B,Anxiety

35114,Constant heart anxiety. Ive been lurking on this sub for about two weeks. It all started one morning after shoveling heaps of snow and ice off of my car for about 40 minutes. I got to work and felt a distinct fluttery feeling in my chest several times over the course of an hour or two. That has subsided but for the past two weeks Ive had what I can only describe as a discomfort in my upper left chest that comes and goes. Ive always been the person who googles every single symptom and constantly catastrophizes every situation. So after this incident Ive monitored every ache and pain every strange feeling every random heartbeat that seems too strong or out of place. I am 31f and I have many symptoms of acid reflux and also a great deal of general anxiety. It also doesnt help that I work on my feet moving and lifting things all day long so while I get in a healthy step count daily my arms shoulders back and legs are usually hurting one way or the other.I am scheduling an appointment with my GP but Im hoping to find some reprieve from the constant googling as well as the fueling of my anxiety caused by any minor unfamiliar twinge in my body. Any advice is greatly appreciated!,Anxiety

About 2 weeks ago I was walking home from the train station and suddenly felt like I wasnt real and that everything around me including the world was fake as in Im not alive or this isnt real life.

33964,Going to Battle HA? Hi AllFirst time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years with each year worse than the one before. For the last 6 months my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise I am thin and bruise like a peach or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I dont have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a wellrespected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. The problem? Im scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. Ive avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety. Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster? I just need to pickup the phone and make the call. Would love to make progress on this in 2018. Help?,Anxiety

35643,Terrified that I have Lung Cancer Hi all. 29 yo F. Never smoked a cigarette in my life but I have fully convinced myself that I have lung cancer and it has consumed me fully. I spend the entire day googling symptoms. I have had a weird on and off cough since September. It doesn't keep me up at night though. It is somewhat productive with clear mucus. My breathing also feels strange like I have to do a little cough when I exhale sometimes. I've recently noticed pain in my midupper back near my spine. ampx200BIn December I started having a bad pain below my shoulder blade. My PCP ordered a chest xray which came back normal. I had a CBC in December which was normal except for low B12 which I've been supplementing with B12 vitamins now.ampx200BDo you think it's worth me asking my PCP for a low dose ct scan?,Anxiety
35652,TSS Ive used super absorbent tampons over the course of the last few days. I may have left one in a tick more than 8 hours yesterday and now Ive convinced myself that my hands are redder than usual and that Im going to die. No fever chills vomiting or diarrhea. Some peeling on my feet pads of toes but that couldve been there for weeks because its been a bit since I got a pedicure. My hands and feet do feel a teeny tiny bit tingly but that very well could be because Im having a mini freak out. My understanding is that if I actually have TSS I would know that something is up relatively quickly. ,Anxiety
33983,Uneven pupils on Friday I was looking in the mirror and noticed that my left pupil is much larger than my right. The vision in that eye is also blurry. I visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right but he didn't know why. He assumed that its something I've always had but only noticed now but that's impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke hello health anxiety. a few days before the uneven pupils I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear usually pulsatile rushing noise. I'm afraid its either a carotid dissectionstroke or some sort of tumor. Maybe I had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue? Anyway I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had weird eye issues or fears. Its tough to have all these thoughts in my head without anyone listening or taking them seriously. ,Anxiety

I've always felt so embarrassed and ashamed of these fantasies and I've realized i probably bave these fantasies cause all I've ever wanted was someone to notice how much I'm struggling and actually comfort me and understand how hard everything is for me. but these fantasies just make me feel like a terrible person. I've never admitted this to anyone just cause of how awful it makes me feel when i think about the reality of my fantasies.,Anxiety

I've been googling non stop and I don't know what to do. I've been googling people who lost their hearing and are completely depressed and HIV related to sinus issues because I still have a runny nose all the time and maybe I'm undiagnosed for it.

I don't know what is normal because I've been on edge for years now and I'm scared.I don't know what to do. I go normal for a few days then in a state of panic for another month.

34802,Dealing with it I have been dealing with HA for the past 2years. It is nice to realize I am not alone in my struggles. Currently have a rough bout with getting over the thought that I may have lung cancer. I am a nonsmoker but I constantly am checking my phlegm to see if there is a little bit of blood. I do find very little bits some time but I am sure this is because of my obsessive checking. Been to doctor and had an xray but these always seem like bandaids as the feeling comes back after weeks. I have been to a therapist and tried doing CBT but I find that my HA can quickly snowball if I do not nip it in the bud early on. Kind of where I feel I am at right now. Its hard on my family and wife. She can tell when I am obsessing and if I talk to her she gets frustrated. Cant say I blame her I am pretty frustrated with myself. Dont know what I am expecting from this post but its nice to be able to just put down some thoughts some where and get them off my chest. I do wonder if my experience echos those of others here feel free to message me if you would like to chat. ,Anxiety
35348,I dont understand why my sickness wont go away. Im starting to think I might have neck or throat cancer. Two months ago I went to the doctor due to a cough and a caught up stuffy head Ive had for literally 23 months straight. The doctor gave me decongestants and antibiotics to tackle infections. 1 month later I still have the cough and I developed really bad mouth ulcers which made it extremely difficult to eat or even talk along with a lump developing under my jaw which was supposedly a swollen lymph node. I got a blood test taken. I also had constant tiredness. I got acid reflux then in between all of this which I also got medicine for. Its cured now.I got prescribed medicine again and I got rid of the ulcers and the soreness in my mouth. The lump under my jaw disappeared and my blood tests said I was perfectly fine but I still dont feel right. Another lump has just grown on the right side of my neck this time and my cough and stuffy head is STILL effecting me. Im really starting to worry that this might be something very serious. Why cant I just become fully healthy? Its been months almost 4 months now. Im going back to the doc again on Friday and this time Im going to tell her my concerns. ,Anxiety

35261,Doctors appointment soon. Lots of anxiety I've had a crazy Year. Last year I got a tumor benign removed and ever since that whole situation my health anxiety has done the opposite of going away. I got stomach pains maybe one or two weeks before my surgery and it's around my lower abdomen. It got to the point where I went to the ER and they couldn't figure it out even after doing some urine exams. After a bit it went away. Recently the pain has become chronic though for three weeks now and it feels like a stabbing pain in that area that'll come in waves and is paired with back pain. Cancer is the only thing on my mind especially now that I feel like I'm prone to tumors. I'm very scared. I feel like I'll die tomorrow and nobody would notice or care since they never ask if I'm doing okay even though I'm very obviously going through something and this includes the people closest to me. I can't think about anything else and I don't know what to do besides vent about it here. ,Anxiety

34817,Being persistent with doctors or accepting the 'health anxiety' label and just accepting it? Whats your opinion. So to start off i'm a binge drug user so i occasionally binge on most things meth cocaine heroin etc so i recently developed health anxietyapparently along with lots of pricks and pains in my hands feet eyes pretty much anywhere really nothing chronic but enough to make me panic so i'm wondering should i persist with doctors to fix this or just deal with it. I'm so fed up with being afraid once i sat in the hospital emergency room parking lot snorting cocaine waiting for my heart to mess up so they could figure out the problem and fix itI know that is dumb lol.

34033,Convinced I'm dying. First post in here very nervous so it'll be long winded.On Monday I had pain under my armpit and across my chest on the left side. I convinced myself I had everything from breast cancer to heart failure. Went to the doctor on Thursday and she diagnosed me with shingles. My rash is more like a cluster of spots and it's not itchy or have any of the other symptoms.Since then I've convinced myself my organs are failing and that I have a blood clot.The latest is breast cancer. Was in the shower and noticed a small about an inch long patch of skin that's red. No itch no rash spot or lumps. It's not hot to touch. It's just red skin. The thing that's throwing me is that it's on my right side whereas the shingles is on the left.I've alway suffered with anxiety but never health anxiety. I've just bought a house and I'm moving in on Friday I'm starting to think that because I'm not stressed about that I'm stressing about every single twinge in my body. For example I'm now extremely dizzy. It's a side effect of the anti vitals but I'm here writing a will.Somebody please tell me I'm not going crazy. ,Anxiety

34051,Chest Hey guys i hope everyone is well! This weekend i had slight chest pain and difficulty breathing aswell as a stuffy blocked nose. It was after hours so my local GP doctors surgery was closed meaning the next best thing was the ER..i heard about this deadly flu going around and got my ass straight to the ER as soon as i started feeling this. They did heart monitoring and blood sample as well as a chest x ray and said everything was clear and that it must just be an infection. I was prescribed amoxicillin 500mg 4 a day spread out evenly. I feel better in the sense that my chest isnt as breathless and my nose isnt as stuffy and im generally perkier but the chest pain is still there and im worried about it. What if its fluid in my lung or pneumonia? Its just bizarre that my flulike symptoms have essentially gone in the past 40 hours after 2 days on antibiotics yet i still feel this uncomfortable worrying chest! Any advice? ,Anxiety
34331,Scared of brain amoeba Exactly one year ago I was in New Zealand where they have these geothermal pools which have a brain eating amoeba in them which is why you shouldn't inhale that water. I didn't go into one of those but I did go into a normal hot tub and scraped my knee doing so. And I sat there for a minute before realising that it was actually bleeding so I went up and cleaned the wound and put a band aid on. Then I sat back in but didn't put my knee back in. Lately I have been freaking out over this because I have been thinking a lot about health related things.

For the first time in my life and only two days ago I realized that I can see the veinsartery in my neck visibly pulsate. I have had problems in the past with palpitations but now that I have noticed this I cant go in front of a mirror without freaking out about it.

There isnt much information about this online not that I want to search and freak out some more.What do you guys think is this normal male anatomy?,Anxiety

Its located right above my right testicle and it feels hard and doesn't move. its probably between 12cm and I can't tell if its a cyst as the hair there does look a little red by the root.

35216,Sternum Popping and Pain I'm a 31M. For the past 23 weeks my sternum has been audibly popping. Like my wife heard it the other night when we were eating dinner. At first there was no discomfort but over the past few days pressure builds in the center of my chest causing discomfort. Then my sternum pops and the pain goes away only to return minutes later.I went to the Dr yesterday and got an xray and and ECG which she said looked slightly abnormal compared to an ECG I had in 2014. She is sending me to a cardiologist. I don't know my xray results yet. My appointment with the cardiologist is Feb 25th. Seems so far away and I keep thinking what if I have a heart attack between now and then? I know it's not going to happen but the fear keeps trying to creep in. The pain isn't terrible or dibilitating but its enough to cause me anxiety. Im trying not to let it get the best of me but it's hard. Thanks for reading!,Anxiety

I did it and after about two weeks now I feel less frequent headaches but when I feel it it feels more intense I don't know if it was because of the exercises but I'm scared thinking this supposed aneurysm is getting larger and it's going to rupture Thanks.Everytime I go to the doctor my blood pressure is high because of tenseness I always think that these high blood pressure moments created an aneurysm ,Anxiety

Whats worrying me is that theyre putting me under and Ive had a problem with emergence delirium in one form or another with all of my previous surgeries. It ranges from crying to flailing and trying to tear out my IV. I know that I should tell the PACU team that it has happened before... I just dont want to. Im terrified of waking up in restraints for obvious reasons. I figure Im more likely to lose it if I wake up confused and then realize Im strapped in. Chemical restraints arent easing my anxiety either. So of course Im trying to put it out of my mind. That said my anxiety is so bad that my skin is tingling and Im nauseous. Ill decide what I want to do tomorrow. I just wish I didnt have to deal with it. What would yall do? Warn someone ahead of time and risk the restraints or roll the dice and see if the ED stays at a minimum? ,Bipolar

Anyway usually I enjoy watching movies or reading books and exercise. But I now I've found that I don't have any concentration to do anything except writing my friends letters through mail.

50447,What am I doing with my life. I guess you could say Ive done a lot in my lifetime but I feel like Ive just failed a lot. Before I was diagnosed I was on the fast track to be a lawyer at 22. That didnt happen and now I am divorced and jobless with a useless bachelors degree. I cant take classes at my community college because I cant afford them. I cant take university classes because Ive dropped classes so many times they wont give me financial aid. I have terrible credit and I am deep in credit card personal and student loan debt. I try getting jobs but dont stay at them for more than a few months. I just cant bring myself to do things I dont want to do. Even if its something I need to do to survive I will still just quit. Thats why Im in such a bad spot. I dont know what to do with my life. People say just get a flexible parttime job doing easy stuff but if I dont enjoy it I will literally quit two months in. My parents have been supporting me my entire life even when I was married my ex was a loser. I feel so bad for them to have this failure of a child. Im not eligible for disability because I havent worked enough hours and I'm not eligible for SSI because my parents provide me with everything. Not that I could live off of either of those anyways. Im so frustrated with myself. I'm not sure if I have any hopes or dreams left. I dont know if I need advice or just to vent but here I am.,Bipolar
46461,Pauses in symptoms during hypomania Is it possible to experience a break in symptoms during hypomania? For example I may feel very tired from the lack of sleep for a few hours during the day feel ashamed of hypersexual symptoms or just feel like I've snapped back to my true selfcalmed down only for this fleeting break to end and be brought back up. I'm new to all this and am not yet wellversed enough on the illness or my own individual symptoms to be able to differentiate between a genuinely high mood with the normal mood fluctuations all people experience or being hypomanic. I'm using either zopiclone or ambien regularly for sleep at the moment so I don't know if the drowsiness is perhaps just a hangover from those. I'm also starting abilify though at a very low 2mg so far so unsure if that's potentially causing certain symptoms I'm having as well. I appreciate any insight from you all.,Bipolar

Eleven years of med cocktails that never seemed to get it right you eventually just give up feeling and take your 20mg of Olanzapine every morning because it this point you'd be much sicker from the withdrawal than on the meds themselves. Over a dozen sessions of ECT no matter what memories stayed or are lost to time you'll never forget the first of numerous times you were told that you were going to have this illness they handed to you for the rest of your life.Thank you for reading.

Can if I want but most of the time I'm just a dude with a space suit and a beatup old ship exploring and getting by.In real life the most selfdestructive nonsense I've gotten into has been out of a sense of grandiosity.

Last night as I laid down to sleep and had my eyes closed I had something that felt like a dream but it was something that happened just before I feel asleep. I lucidly thinking about the experience as it was happening.Ill start off with what I think it was. I think it was a new kind of suicidal ideation.Im not religious at all but this dreamlike feeling was full of images that felt like a type of beautiful afterlife like a heaven or something. It was sweeping land and seascapes that looked like something off of an Asia album cover. Everything was iridescent. And I was flying high above it all loftily and effortlessly. It felt like the scenes from the Lost Boys when you see the vampires POV as they fly.It looked so real and so perfect and peaceful and I felt like it was calling me to it. I began to speak to it. I said please.. if this is it please take me. Please take me away from this.Usually if I have SI its miserable and darkly depressing.It felt like the SI was being cunning and alluring this time.,Bipolar

For now he gave me some pills for my insomnia he said that it could just be caused by the lack of sleep. A part of me wishes it does but deep down I know its more than that.

I thought it was just severe suicidal depression but recently within the past year i have been experiencing these nights or grouping of nights where I would stay up and do a ton of random projects and crazy work ideas. Nothing ever got done but after not sleeping and all I would crash. I would hit a depressing suicidal low and not know when it's going to end. Currently this is the longest depressive episode at almost 3 weeks. It's to the point where my grades went from A's to F's and my parents think it's anxiety. I go to a therapist but she doesn't know the full story. I also am being evaluated but that takes months.

47017,How do you live with yourself? A'ight the title is a bit harsh but it's a question I've been asking myself that for the last month or two. I'm 23 and got diagnosed January 2018 and that's when I started on my medication.I got the diagnosis after a massive manic episode and in that manic state I actually thought I had finally found joy in life and an end to my depression for good. A conclusion to my struggles ect ect. But that conclusion was ripped apart as I got the diagnosis. My so called happiness was taken away from me. but being manic was of course very bad for my health since I hardly ever ate and I did reckless shit. You know classic mania 101When I started on the meds I kept telling myself that one day I'll be stable and then I will find a new and better conclusionhappiness. But it's been a year and I'm loosing my patience because I simply don't feel better than what I did before my manic episode before the aggressive depression that lasted a year even before there even was a buildup to that depression.I'm starting to tear up as I write thisI can't live with my own thoughts. They always focus on the pessimistic side of things. And even in bright times they seem to spiral down into some negative memory that involves either depression or mania. all my memories of the mania has turned negative because it's now clear to me how much of an asshole I was and all the badirresponsible shit I did that had consequences on behalf of my friends and people I knew. And these spiraling thoughts always come out of nowhere. Whenever I take my meds I get reminded of the fact that I will be taking them for the rest of my life. That I'll never be Normal and that I might not get to a state where I can call myself happy. ... Yeah back to the question... How do you guys live with this? How do you cope with the fact that we're not normal? Just... How?,Bipolar
46236,On Therapy My therapist is very talented. In fact she was booked for the entire month of December and for all but the last week of this month. That means it'll be almost two months between appointments when I'm used to seeing her twice a month. This has never happened in our quite lengthy time together and I'm scheduled through March from here on out.Therapy is an interesting thing for me. Because I come from a very traumatic background therapy has been a godsend for PTSDrelated issues. What I'd never noticed before though is how much it helps me regulate my mood in between sessions. Knowing I'll have someone to help me sort through random thoughts and make sense of any major shifts or psychotic issues allows me to keep the jumble in the background. It's like static I can tolerate the static when I know there will eventually be someone who can help me understand how the radio works. bad example but best I can do.My therapist pdoc and I constantly assess whether therapy is beneficial to me because it has been ongoing for quite some time. We were all of the understanding that yes in fact I get a great deal of benefit from therapy. Now I'm one month into not having therapy and things are falling absolutely apart. Suspicion confirmed.I will go on through this month doing the best I can and I will try not to break any more aspects of life. Then I will spend a couple of sessions picking up the pieces and hoping this sort of break in our therapy journey does not happen again anytime soon.,Bipolar

46363,I feel like bipolar is ignored. Anyone know any good mental health nonprofits that actually support bipolar? I've liked TWLOHA since I was in high school because of their dedication to preventing suicide and they were really connected to the music scene I was into but now as I'm older and diagnosed I'll listen to their podcasts and watch their social media and there's nothing that ever acknowledges bipolar. Just depression and anxiety. I feel like most organizations are this way. They support anxiety and depression because they're the trendy things to support while things like bipolar borderline and schizophrenia are still too scary and inappropriate to mention. I'd really like to see an organization that recognizes bipolar and supports more mental illnesses than just depression and anxiety. Anyone know of any good ones? In the US so ones available in the US preferred.,Bipolar

I by no means ever want to force someone into it if they don't want to but I find myself becoming extremely frustrated when I'm giving some pretty clear hints without being forceful and he just isn't getting it. I'm not sure if it's the combination of sexual frustration and rejection or what but I become unreasonably angry. I don't say anything because I don't want to sound like an asshole but it's very frustrating. We only have sex once a week sometimes not yet we spend the whole weekend together almost every weekend.

46287,A minor adjustment to my meds. So Ive been really lucky with meds and lifestyle changes being really successful for me. I have bipolar 2 and anxiety Ive been pretty much stable with little dips into mild depression for awhile. I was only taking gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. Gabapentin was the first mood stabilizer I ever tried and its always kept my hypomania at bay and my anxiety dialed down a little. Hydroxyzine comes in for sleep and breakthrough anxiety. It works. Im productive and mostly good. But the little dips into mild depression started to string together and I feared I might go into a deep depressive episode so I just told my doctor I want to add an SSRI. Were trying Celexa right now. So I took it last night she said some people prefer night some morning for the first time and couldnt sleep very well. So Im definitely going to switch to the morning from now on. I had a little stomach upset but not too bad. I slept less than I need to but I feel really good this morning. Im still on my gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. And will go back to take just the hydroxyzines at night so I go back to sleeping normally. BUT I dont know if its too soon to tell obviously its been like 12 hours but this morning I got up feeling really optimistic and happy to start my day. Maybe this is placebo effect although Im usually skeptical that things will work or maybe Im just super lucky with things working on the first try. I dont know. Just letting yall know that Im feeling optimistic and happy. I felt pretty good before but let my doctor know even though I was stable I was still struggling a little with depression and Im hopefully this addition works out. ,Bipolar

50078,On Moods and Mania I have been thinking a lot about this today and I just want to share some thoughts with you guys. It has been 18 years since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That I live with this is no surprise to anybody who knows me. This disease is so much more nuanced than the typical extreme ups and downs description it usually receives. I have survived two absolutely devastating depressions and approximately twenty manic episodes. Attempting to describe what mania is like is the worst frustration. It happens gradually and then comes upon me like a brick to the face. First I stop sleeping then the creativity comes. The blank page beckons to me the way freshly baked bread might entice the starving. It is soft at first subtle even but the persistent pentopage prevails and soon I am unable to make sense of or even put into context the hasty and paranoid puzzle of words. Grandiosity accompanies the writing then the delusions come and I believe that this puzzle of words is worthy of a Pulitzer. Other things happen too reckless driving substance use rage impulsivity irrationality.... Ultimately I surrender to complete psychosis. Saying it is a lot is an understatement. I have destroyed and lost relationships with family members and friends because of this illness. I have said and done unforgivable things. But it is my deepest wish that people understand that becoming manic is not a choice it has happened to me whilst on medication and off alike. I would never choose it. I'm simply reflecting on all of this today because earlier I read this Bipolar disorder results in 9.2 years reduction in expected life span and as many as one in five patients with bipolar disorder completes suicide. National Institute of Mental Health.That's the reality. It's my reality. I do not want to ever become a statistic and I want to live as full a life as possible.Here is what I'm grateful for I have an incredible support network. I have doctors and therapy. I have the most loving and supportive family and friends ones who are able to look beyond my illness and recognize that I am not me in those manic moments. And I am grateful for the ability to empathize with all those who struggle. We can do together what we could never do alone.,Bipolar

My feelings it feels impossible to have an angry outburst now and I know that is not healthy. I feel so dumb but is it because of just smoking weed? I feel like THCCBD stabilizes my moods in a much better way. No matter what happens in the day or morning I feel ungodly restless until I smoke.I know it is entirely my fault for being like this a NEET but I don't know why I find it so damn hard now. Essential tasks feel so hard to do and I've felt dissociated for so long but I also feel like it might really the blurriness from Lamictal poor eyesight. I feel like what is up with me is more than BPII or anxiety. I genuinely feel that I may have aspergers or something. I don't know. Really I want to go back to myself a nice shy person who at least has a wave of motivation to chase my dreams. I want MOTIVATION and the ability TO DO.I dream of being an artist but now I feel such little emotion to express and really I don't care I just want to be able to MAKE STUFF.

45447,Is it a trick of depression to not care about getting better? I just dont care. I used to want to get better but right now I dont care. I could just eat and sleep and drink beer and read books and thats it. Go on forever never seeing friends never accomplishing anything.Is this a trick or am I just fucked up and weird?,Bipolar
50271,Recently diagnosed 24yoF. I was recently diagnosed this past December. Bipolar and other mental illnesses runs genetically on my mothers side of the family i didnt get to know my mom she died her sister is bipolar but she is a very heavy meth addict so i dont really go to her for advice or support. My dad is one of those people that dont believe in a mental illness. My doctor has given me a low dose Seroquelcymbalta combo and it does help 75 of the time. I also started a new job i used to be a medical assistant but i honestly think it made my condition so much worse. I think i always showed signs of being bipolar but never recognized them. But when i was a medical assistant i think it made me so much worse. Im here because is anyone elses mania miserable? When Im manic its like Im so overwhelmed with adrenaline. I cant sleep extreme irritationrage and horrible anxiety. How have you learned to tell the difference between how you actually truly feel and when your being irrational? Is it possible to have a successfulstable relationship when your bipolar? Sometimes i just feel like when my feelings are so strong and intense i am such a toxic person and its gross and i want to fix it.,Bipolar
45925,Is this bipolar? Im 30 yo and i just went to a psychiatrist for the first time. I have been wanting to go for years but felt like ive never had the time. There has been a lot of drastic change in my life for the past few years most of it for the better i think but lately its just getting harder to deal with all the emotions at once. What prompted me to finally make the appointment was that i had 3 one night stands in one week. Whenever i tell a friend this it seems like im bragging they say they dont see the problem. But the problem is i didnt feel like i could control my urges and i actually got seriously physically hurt because of it. I actually forgot to mention this episode to the doctor during the session. Still she prescribed me 25mg of Zoloft which im starting next week... i did some research and i think i may be mildly bipolar. But is to possible to get to 30 before needing to be diagnosed? Im starting medication next week. Not sure what to expect. ,Bipolar

50292,I don't know how to be present in the moment and time slips away I feel restless from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed i am an artist for a living and i use to enjoy making art. Let alone self care like long showers and making a nice meal. Everything feels rushed like time is running out. I'm never fully present when doing things and i always find my mind wandering and not focusing on the task at hand. Mentally i'm scattered with just about everything and executive function is non existent. I want my life back and I want to feel like I have time. Even if I tell myself I have time I can't just sit down and have my mind stop too. My mind never stops even if my body can't keep going,Bipolar
50167,How do you cope with the brain fog? I've been diagnosed for 4 years and on latuda just as long and I'm really struggling with the brain fog way more than I used to. I used to take modafinil for fatigue and I felt like a person again but I can't take it anymore due to circumstances out of my control and I'm wondering what people do to regain function. It doesn't feel like the depression fog all that much it feels like my brain simply does not work. I notice how I'm unable to understand even the simplest of things no matter how hard I try even things I used to be able to do without difficulty. I'm considering dropping out of college because I simply can't work fast enough to keep up with the load and I can't stay awake long enough to work on things.I'm taking caffeine pills and drinking absurd amounts of coffee to try and keep myself awake long enough to do anything but I don't think this is sustainable.Does anyone have advice that isn't go talk to your psychiatrist because I am but I'm turning to the community to see what's helped other people.Thank you 3,Bipolar
49902,Going on a long vacation 21 days with a big time change. Time change and taking meds question. So I have all my meds filled and enough for the trip afterwards. I typically take my meds at 8pm every night and right before bed. Im very good at taking my meds on time I really dont miss them so I just want to be safe when it comes to being in a different time zone. Do I take them at the same in the other country or do I take them at the same time I would while there? And any tips from you guys about traveling.

50490,In a deep depression My fianc left me on Monday and Im in a deep depression. She gave no sign that she was unhappy or anything and just left. Im suffering badly and dont want to be here right now. I dont know what to do Ive tried talking to her but she wants nothing to do to with me. We had so many plans and dreams with each other. Last week we were looking at places to get married. Im fucking miserable and dont know what to do.I called my provider but earliest she can see me is the 10th. My anxiety and paranoia are extremely high and I just want my brain to shut off. It doesnt help that its possible Im schizoaffective disorder and not bipolar. I just want her back and to hear her laugh again.,Bipolar
49490,How do you deal with your past? I dated an undiagnosed bipolar 1 while I was an undiagnosed bipolar 2. We met on a mania in our early 20s. Im sure many of you can imagine the drugs and fun we had on our high. I ended up pregnant. He came down hard and I started having suicidal thoughts from all the drama being bipolar entails. I had an abortion. It was the abortion or drive off a bridge. Even his catholic family had choice words for me that made me feel all the more trapped.I cleaned up and went back to college and started traveling more. He went to rehab 2ce. I wrote him while in rehab the 2nd time. He was kicked out of rehab for acting on his hypersexuality. Him and the lady became a couple and had a daughter. I leave him alone because now hes diagnosed and I took a few college courses to educate myself on mental illness. I knew he wasnt in full control. He would call me from fake numbers in the middle of the night and wed talk never meeting up. His lady caught on and would call and confront me. I sent her receipts that its him after me. Eventually he stopped contacting me knowing Id snitch.Its been 8 years and Im now diagnosed and medicated myself. I recently had my own daughter. Ive been thinking about him and looked him up. He reached out to me 2 years ago right before I was diagnosed and I responded with his arrest record.As Im looking into him I find out he was in a coma from going in to cardiac arrest. Hes learning to walk talk and move his hands again. It looks like he lost a finger. His family hasnt posted any information about how or why. Also my daughter has the same name as his mom totally forgot his moms name and my spouse picked the name.Im in this fog of wanting to reach out but also why? We are living separate lives. Its been almost a decade! I questioned if it was real love or the mania for so long..My spouse and father of my daughter is a good guy. Hes stable and loving. He isnt jealous and we have talked about the ex in the past. We have agreed that we chose each other and not the exs. However he will never understand what not being in full control is like.Its how I ended up on this sub. Looking to see if I was as crazy as I felt. Looking for similar experiences and stories and boy did I find my community. Just looking to get this off my chest and for yalls 2 cents and experiences.,Bipolar

The OCD type of if I don't worry about this enough do this ask this something horrible will happen. Some of my worries are valid but the people in my life assure me it will be manageable if they even happen. I don't see it that way for me it's my fault if I don't worry enough or fix it. I feel responsible for everything in everyone's life. I don't want anything bad to happen to the ones I love I can not handle that.

I recently switched docs and this one prescribed generic Latuda which I've been on for a little over a week now. Everything just feels so hopeless and I'm scared that I'll never feel happy again. All I do is work I hate my job and sleep. I used to enjoy reading and playing video games but nothing sounds fun anymore. I'm in a constant state of exhaustion even after sleeping for 1112 hours at a time. My apartment looks like a bomb went off in it but I just don't have the energy to care or do anything about it.

Im in a depressive state and havent had a manic episode in over two years now. Some hypomania but nothing too concerning.Ive been having a hard time with work recently. After finding this community Ive discovered that Im not the only one with trouble holding down a job. I have a relatively high paying job for my area that allows me to live at least paycheck to paycheck with one pay period worth in my savings. I guess I dont really know where to start but I just cant work my job anymore. I have this horrible depression and the job itself is very difficult. I have FMLA for my mental health and can take up to 2 days off per week and also have time off for appointments. Im finding myself needing more and more time off unpaid and I dont know what to do.I applied for a much lower paying job but I feel like it will be much better for my mental health.Im just so upset and defeated I dont know if Ill start this new job in a good mental state if I even get it.Ive considered short term disability because I just feel like I cant stand a single more day working my current job. I just want to cry the whole time. I feel like such a failure.Im looking into doing a year longDBT program. It was recommended by both my therapist and psychiatrist.Im just having such a hard time making decisions. I know I need to leave this job. I feel like my body and mind is screaming out for help.

Its a type of loneliness Ive never felt before its so bad it physically hurts. I cant find the words to explain the intensity of it. It hurts so bad. I can genuinely say I have only one friend and she lives halfway across the world. I live with my parents while I attend college. I have to take online classes so the only time I really leave my house is to go to a coffeeshop a couple days a week. I dont have a drivers license due to crippling anxiety Im working on getting it so even if I did have friends I wouldnt be able to see them often. So I have no one. No one to talk to besides my parents and thats just mostly superficial stuff.Im sorry if this is all over the place.

46962,Recent experience with lamictal amp painkillers Hello friends.I've been on lamictal for about 8 months. It was a godsend to me. Starting from a very low dose it helped me feel more content and atease and I went from having panic attacks every time I left the house to being able to go about and live my life.Here's the wrinkle I initially spiraled into crippling depression and anxiety last year after tapering off of the opiate pain medication oxycodone. I was on on oxycodone after undergoing a surgical procedure to stabilize much of my cervical spine which had become unstable as a result of a genetic condition I have. I was in a horrible place and Lamictal is what finally got me out of it.I was about 9 months postop last year and doing really well feeling really great about my health and future when a bunch of my preoperative symptoms suddenly returned. Scans confirmed that my surgery had failed and I had to go through a revision procedure a more complex procedure than I had before earlier this year. Currently I am a bit more than 2 months postop from the revision surgery. I was hoping to keep my pain meds low and get off of them quickly this time around but the surgery was predictably much more painful and I also developed an infection shortly after surgery that sent my pain levels skyhigh unlike anything I had experienced before. So while I wanted to limit my use of oxycodone I ended up on double the dose I took last year 60 mg total per day vs. 30 mg total per day last year.I have spent the last month carefully tapering off of oxycodone. I am now down to 25 of what I was initially taking after surgery i.e. I'm now down to 15 mg total per day which is 50 of what I was taking last year. Everything seemed to be going smoothly which I attributed in part to being on lamictal this time. Then about a week ago just before the stepdown to my current oxycodone dose I started to feel the depression creep back in. Hoping to get ahead of it I called my pdoc and we decided to increase my dose of lamictal a bit from 125 mg to 150 mg. But instead of protecting me from decline I feel like the increased dose accelerated the onset of symptoms. I am significantly more depressed and irritable and I have started to become anxious and a bit agoraphobic again. Making matters much worse some physical symptoms have flared up this week including a very alarming sharp pain right at the base of where my surgery was performed. While these symptoms may be a normal part of the long healing process after a major surgical procedure I am terrified that something got screwed up again. I took a little extra oxycodone this morning and it has helped the pain somewhat but this is obviously not the direction I want to go in for the sake of my mental health.I guess I'm posting here because I feel frightened and a bit trapped. Last year lamictal was like a miracle for me. I felt relief at a very low dose and I continued to experience improvement as I increased the dose. I was hoping for the same result when I increased the dose last week but I am only feeling more depressed and anxious. That said there are a ton of other factors in play here including my oxycodone taper continued recovery from surgery 2 months ago a flareup of physical symptoms fear about the state of my surgery and recovery normal psychological distress resulting from my current ordeal feeling isolatedcooped up losing autonomy feeling uncertain about my future etc. fear of the fear I experienced last year when things went south etc. etc.Typing this out it seems unreasonable to expect anything from a small increase in my lamictal dose one way or the other or at the very least it seems impossible to parse out what is a result of lamictal versus the many other things going on. But I guess I'll still throw my inquires out thereHas anyone experienced a marked increase in depression or anxiety upon increasing their lamictal dose and if so did things even out with time or further dosage increases?Does anyone have experience with oxycodone other opiate painkillers that impacted your mental health or interacted with your psych meds?For what it's worth I also take Effexor XR 75 mg daily Dexedrine SR 5 mg 2xday and Klonopin 0.5 mg at night to sleep.,Bipolar

46896,Gotta keep occupied Ugh. I've been unemployed and out of school for two weeks now. I finished my masters program on the 17th and my last day of work was the 15th. I'm applying to a million jobs right now. But I have always done so much better with structure and routine. It's only been two weeks and I already feel myself slipping into a depressed episode. I realized today I hasn't gotten dressed or left my house in 5 days. I went for a 2 mile walk today just to get dressed and out of the house. My sister who I live with even commented on the fact that I was dressed today. I can feel myself slipping but not sure what to do about it. I dont have any income so I cant go out and do much right now nothing that costs money at least. And I dont have a car either to really go anywhere. I just dont want to get stuck in a depression right now when so much of my life needs to be changing. Any suggestions on creating some sort of structure and routine when I have no job no classes and no money? I'm thinking about trying to go walking everyday just to get out of the house. And also getting up and getting dressed even if I have nowhere to go. I want this mini vacation to be over already and back to an 85 job where things are predictable. I hate not having anything to do. ,Bipolar
45474,Latuda Dose Increase? I've been taking 20mg of latuda since october 2016 with 1500mg of lithium.. the latuda definitely gave me the moodfunctioning boost i didn't even realize i needed and i feel like i'm back headed towards the rut where my medication could be more on point but nonetheless its working. my pdoc suggested i go from 20mg latuda to 40mg. i'm thinking about agreeing to it and increasing before i have an episode that forces me to switch up my meds.. i just have a few concerns about increasing... i haven't experienced any side effects from latuda. what are some of the things to be aware of that you guys have experienced when you started taking it or when you increased your dose? next do i need to eat even more before i take it? that may be a dumb question but the nausea is excruciating when not eating enough even after 20mg. and last did you guys like have any side effects after increasing? maybe being overtired or a major mood shift? idk i'll stop rambling just looking to hear some peoples thoughtsadviceexperience with increasing their dose.

I'm still questioning if I actually have bipolar though because anxiety is my main problem. I haven't really experienced full on maniaatleast I don't think I only get very irritable and talk fast randomly for a short period of time. I get depressed for about a month then I'm fine. I can see some small signs but nothing that jumps out as being apart of bipolar. I guess I just don't understand yet. I don't know.

46891,just ask for help isn't working I am curse word struggling. ampx200BBackground I have been diagnosed by a PCP since 2012 with MDD GAD. In 2016 I started seeing a male PCP in the south who told me he would handle my diagnosis unless he felt I needed to see a specialist. He changed me from Celexa to a high dose of Prozac increased my Seroquel put me on upto 9 Xanax a day as well as Klonpin. Diagnosed me with ADHD and started adderall. He changed my meds a few times saying I did not need to wean off or on as they were in the same family....I ended up in ER twice. Had several Manic breakdownshysterical fits i didn't consider bipolar at the time lost time....then over christmas he left and the other dr refused to process my xanax refill and I went through 2 weeks of withdrawal. When he returned he apologized and said I'm surprised you're here most people don't make it through that alive without hospitalization....I stopped going outside of needed refills. In 2018 I had no insurance and my partner and I decided I would probably be okay going off meds for a bit and use cannabis legal here as the previous Dr had suggested. ampx200BThat is when things got bad. My symptoms blew up and I started changing I also turned 25. I've never been an angry person not even when I should be. All of a sudeen I couldn't make it through work. I couldnt think. My moods were changing and I would have a week or two and then literally not be able to do ANYTHING for weeks. The house started getting messier I wasn't cooking or eating canceling shifts left and right couldn't think or read through anything....My partner started expressing conern over my need to at least get back on seroquel and adderall. In august our dog died traumatically. PTSD symptoms fllared. My partner has BPD anxiety and depression that is not medicated. His anxiety sending me into full panic attacks and anger. ampx200BI got insurance this year and January I requested an appointment with a PCP. She immeadiately referred me to a Psychiatrist and Psychologist. First available appointment for therapy is March 25. Med appointment with Psych not available until April 9. Doctor calls and asks for urgent appointments. psych calls and says they can make an exception and get me in on April 7 I decline as 2 days isn't enough to move my off request from work. PCP has me come in to address medicine and for safety checks mentioning inpatient options. I can't do that. It is not an option. I have laid out my sypmtoms and cited that my sister and father have Bipolar disorder. My chart says Bipolar 2 suspected but not formally diagnosed depression anxiety adhd nos.ampx200BToday I went in telling her it seems my depression has improved marginally but my anxiety has been horrible and constant. shaking constanty not sleeping headaches and picking my skin on my face and arms worse than I have in a year i skin pick with anxiety. She ups the limotrigene literally making me take more in the office ultimate goal of upping to 200 mg in two weeks. She puts me back on Seroquel and then tells me she would like to take me off the adderall and wished she had not started it as she attended a conference for patient's in crisis and they expressed the need to treat Bipolar or other disorders before ADHD and adderall. Says it may be part of the anxiety. I tell her I think it is a bad idea as it is the only improvement I have had to mood ability to get out of bed and work and it seems to sometimes help the anxiety probably because I can think somewhat clearly. She then tells me to come in next week and that the psych doc may completely change my meds in two weeks and he or she may still take me off of Adderall. Hopes the seroquel will aid in sleep picking and anxiety as well as upping the limotrigine. Perscribes me nothing for the panic constant anxiety not even refilling the 5 mg of Lorazepam she previously would give me 510 at a time. To be fair I told her it wasn't doing much of anything and I did not ask for a refill today thinking she would perscribe SOMETHING to help me.ampx200BI am completely overwhelmed. I have been screaming for help for months and all I have been able to get from it has been constant med changes which I know is a thing but.... wants to take me off the only thing that is helping and just basically having them hope I'll make it through until the med appointment and checking weekly to see if I have killed myself or been admitted yet. The idea of going off the adderall literally crushed me. The mention of starting completely over was too much. I was literally crying and shaking the entire time I was in the appointment. I didn't ask for this. I am barely holding on. My social life is gone I can't make any commitment by the time it comes up either from anxiety depression or complete exhaustion. I didn't ask for this. I can't enjoy things. I can't breathe or stop shaking. My mouth is twiching from constantly holding it in a weird position to prevent my chin from shaking. I'm falling apart and everyone see's it but there is nothing they can do? How am I supposed to do this? Killing myself wouldn't even matter. It would make everything worse for the people already suffering from me I'd just be another number on a statistic sheet and other people would still go through this. I have lost 13 friends 10 to suicide. One was a fucking psychologist.ampx200BTLDR this process of waiting and changing meds while waiting for 3 months for psych is too much. Any help appreciated. Even just empathy or your experience. Thanks lt3,Bipolar

46194,Disgust with partner during depressive episode We all know the pattern infatuation with new s.o. Then a few months later when depression kicks in they become the most annoying disgusting person. I'm aware it's the illness and it will pass but once those thoughts are formed the magic of the relationship is gone and I'm back to believing that I'm better off alone. It's too much work to push through the depressive period trying to make myself feel better and get out of the mood but also to convince my partner that it's all ok and I still like them. I simply want to be alone when I am depressed and it's annoying and a huge turn off to have to validate a partner when I am fighting tooth and nail not to jump off a bridge from the depression. Please talk some sense into me or tell me how you cope when this happens! ,Bipolar
49551,Im bipolar type 1 but getting a real wake up call on why I should stay on my meds bc of someone I care about. Someone I really care about is tackling bipolar disorder without medication due to the expense of a psychiatrist. Hes finally in a place where he can get one but with a long waitlist in his area its difficult. Its so hard to watch. Its like Im looking in a mirror and just seeing myself 3 years ago when I was at the height of my illness. The lashing out volatile nature hopelessness he feels hurts me horribly because I know from experience there is nothing I can do. Hes either ignoring me or cant leave me alone and I dont blame that on him whatsoever. Every time he hurts my feelings rn I have to remind myself that 3 years ago I was the same way. It just sucks so much to watch someone you care about go through something like this knowing there is so little in support you can offer. Him and I are so desperate for him to see a psychiatrist and get stable and are waiting anxiously for next week when its finally happening but even then I know it takes a while for the meds to help. It just hurts so badly to see someone go through that and knowing exactly the type of pain and anger they are feeling and the helplessness of it.,Bipolar
45533,Meds or anxiety?? SOS Hi friends. Ive been experiencing muscle tension and spazzing in my legs that shoots throughout my whole body over and over again. It gets stronger as the attack goes on for sometimes hours and then just disappears out of no where. Im wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what it may be from? Im prescribed Latuda benztropine trazodone and propanoral spelling may not be right in some of those Please help! These attacks make me feel like I could murder myself and everyone around me. They make me feel like theres no reason to live like this. Im not sure if the episodes are anxiety inflicted or a horrible side effect from the meds. ,Bipolar
50197,Do we have any other bipolar nurses here? I notice myself switching jobs quite often.... I just applied for an inpatient psych unit hoping to God that I get in. I need more money. But this disability makes it so fucking hard. I work in case management currently mostly doing education for patients in the clinic. It's a low profile job and it doesn't pay that great for what I need. I'm afraid one day we won't be able to pay for the essentials...I've worked the floor rehab research home health and now my current job. I've hated everything. I keep getting depressed. Then I want to change jobs again. I can only hope that my current application will go through....I need more money. And I need those students loan repayments that they offer. I have great health insurance through where I work currently but again it just simply does not pay enough for me. Can anyone else relate to this? I really hate my life right now...,Bipolar
45949,Obnoxious people in group therapy Im doing an 8 week bipolarstress management program. Its the first group Ive ever attended despite having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 78 years now. Im getting a lot out of it and I mostly enjoy the group format... except for that. One. Fucking. Guy.Hes racist hes obnoxious he overshares he tries to work in how much money he has into every conversation and he just wont shut the fuck up. Tonight he shared his biggest trigger which was having so much money he has to talk to the bank a lot and he hates it when he has to speak to stupid people in call centers he cant understand. He has to talk to the bank all the time because he has sooooo much money like SEVEN FIGURES and its soooooooo hard. He doesnt attend every group but hes irritated me since the first time I met him Im legitimately pleased when hes not in the group! Tonight I wanted to walk out!Theres a diverse mix of people at various stages of illness that attend and I get along with them just fine I just cant stand this asshole.

50274,Is it possible to turn your life around if you hate every waking moment of it. After finally coming to terms with the fact that mania has ruined everything good Ive worked so hard for in my life Im recommitted to bettering myself. Only issue is I keep comparing my current situation to the past when tunings were good. I really want to graduate college. I do. I went for three years. However now I cry after every class and have panic attacks at the thought of having to do the work andor study to get through it. Not to mention that my program of study is going to take 2.5 years to complete and I have no motivation. I dont know what to do anymore. Im miserable if I just sit home and do nothing and Im miserable when I go out and actually try something. Advice?? ,Bipolar
49741,Wondering if I was misdiagnosed no Im not taking myself off of my meds. Ive been struggling a bit recently. 33F diagnosed bipolar type unspecified 4 years ago.I have a clear history of depression going back to high school that I dont dispute. I was diagnosed ADHD as an elementary schooler and again in high school good student but disruptive in class incessant talker impulse control issues highly unmotivated unless Im interested in the subject object permanence issues that persist today medicated for it on and off was prescribed a variety of medications and responded best to Adderall but I also have a touch of anxiety so dosing was finicky. Treating the ADHD diagnosis yielded some progress but never addressed all of my issues. I was medicated for depression at various times with similar results but notably was never treated for both diagnoses at the same time. Edited a typo.Four years ago I was unmedicated and my depression was the worst it had ever been. I started seeing a new psychiatrist pried a bit into my family medical history both ADHD and bipolar appear and got a bipolar diagnosis. Ive been on Trileptal and Wellbutrin since then and like before I feel a little better than I did before the meds but the issues arent addressed. My symptoms are mixed and I feel some degree of symptomatic obviously good days and bad ones every single day. My manic symptoms consistently spike in conjunction with anxiety flare ups which are always traceable to a trigger.My sister 28F is diagnosed with depression and ADHD and when she describes how the combination affects her it matches up to my constant mixed symptoms to a T. Ive started to wonder if I havent been going at my mental health the wrong way and Im extremely anxious about bringing it up to my doctor for fear of sounding manic. I dont think that Im healed or no longer in need of meds and I dont plan on taking myself off of them. I also dont plan on asking for stimulants Im open to any treatment plan deemed a fit. But I have a lot of concern that I wont be taken seriously.Has anyone been through anything like this? To be clear Im not asking for commentary on a diagnosis! Just seeking advice for broaching this subject with my doctor. Part of me wonders if I might be best off trying to connect with a new one Ive raised concerns about my meds not being effective numerous times in the past and havent really felt heard. But then I worry about the appearance of doctor shopping and again Im not actively seeking stimulants. Anyway any wisdom would be appreciated!,Bipolar

I then switched my job again to accommodate his hours didnt see each other often and I wasnt going to bed until 12 am when I got off work at 1130pm. JulyDecember I was out of my mind.

46981,Are we allowed to drink in moderate doses? Hello allI am wondering if we are allowed to drink. My doctor told me that I may use from time to time but he didn't tell a definitite amount.

Is it okay to drink one or two glasses of wine or beer once in a while e.g one or two days a week?,Bipolar
46560,I feel like things are catching up to me and I am tired I spent the last two years telling myself to not be sad or angry and telling myself that depressive issues were simply unacceptable and disregarding the patterns because I managed symptoms so well for four years. Got into my dream school after five years no selfconfidence not solod on resources too much pressure depressive cycling poor performance got kicked out. Took time off made a bunch of promises. Three months back in the school everyone was so happy and I was kicked out again. The depressive episodes and ensuing nastiness fed feed off of my extreme guilt and fear from a lack of support structure and having ruined my opportunities already at this age and crashed my big dream.I was discouraged from working so I could not always comfortably cover psych and meds. All I wanted was to be free. Any money I receive came with strings attached with the subtext that I would do what 'normal people' do get a degree to be a valid person with a future like your sibling narrative. So I lied about school lied about my health trying the same things over because I wanted the help I recieved to be valid and prove myself as not problematic. Then I hid the drop out. I am terrified of the person of influence who I lied to the most. I wrote a letter clearly explaining that I am not better than other people with mental illnesses and need to reevaluate my choices because continuing to try when I just keep cycling is stupid. I did not receive a good response. To me admitting my fear of failure shame and poor mental health a sentence and 50. No contact for a month. So I know what to expect. I hurt them by lying since they put in alot of time and money to help me get this far. But they were really calculated and nasty in the past and I don't know if the rug will get pulled from under me by coming clean.Now I sitting in this place I won't have the money for soon on a phone that will get shut off havent seen my psych in two months trying to imagine a future different from the only one I ever imagined or not being homeless. I want to freak out scream and walk off but I need to get a job move and think about a new future. All the food I ate didn't make me feel better and frankly I'm more likely to get employed if I look decent so I should cool it thereHe even sent me a Valentines Day card before I sent that fucking awful letter. I feel like a piece of shit. I ruined myself,Bipolar
45743,Unsure if I'm bipolarborderlineneither... I know no one can make a diagnosis except a doctor but I was just wondering what others experiences are. I have been on mood stabilizers for about 2 months now. They have really seemed to help me and I have been practicing meditationDBTmindfulnesswhich goes along with the DBT.I was diagnosed as bipolar in December when I was baker acted in late November because I was contemplating suicide. Okay I've been missing my medications and I've been contemplating going out and doing drugs and having sex I'm also extremely irritable and I just want to push people out of my life. I can't stop thinking about these two guys I have a crush on and I almost want them to stop talking to me by messaging them to delete me from their phones off their messaging apps etc. I've done this kind of stuff all my life well since I was a teenager I'm 25 now... I'd just randomly push people awaymostly guys I'd have a crush on... It's like I was upset with myself for thinking about them so much and I figured the only way to make it stop was to push them away but I'd almost regret it afterwards. When it came to female friends I'd just disappear on them for months at a time. Also I'd have impulse control issues during these phases but it would only come on randomly like spending money overeating sex drugs drinking etc. It's weird because in daily life most people would never guess I have these issues since I'm really nice and I try to keep these problems to myself and my mom and my therapist. Right now though I'm feeling all the urges associated with my manic episodes and I'm not sure what to do. I started taking my medicine tonight so I'm hoping it will help. I'm on Lamictal and Trileptal if anyone is interested... Does this sound familiar to anyone else? I know all experiences are different but I've asked other friends and family members before if they ever have these type of experiences and they just look at me like I'm crazy. ,Bipolar

46274,Psychosis or just anxiety? Recently I've been having this strong feeling that people around me can tell what I'm thinking tell that I'm constantly thinking about killing myself. I feel like people are always looking at me with this mix of pity and disgust because they can tell I'm suicidal. It makes me feel really anxious about being out in public. I know it's not possible for people to hear my thoughts but I can't shake the feeling that they can.This started happening a couple days ago after I quit all my meds cold turkey about two weeks ago I know not smart.Could this be psychosis or am I just anxious?,Bipolar
50272,What kind of therapy do you do? I haven't had a therapist for a while because I felt like it wasn't working for me. I am very self aware which just seems to make it difficult. I can describe my feelings and thoughts well so they don't understand why I'm struggling. It's like just because I can articulate it or locate the source of the problem doesn't mean I'm actually working through it. Does anyone else have this problem?

46191,Happy New Year! Here's my Resolution I want to notice the times when I am alright. Really notice them stop to think hey my mood is okay right now I'm not anxious and I'm safe. Taking a moment to just feel my body and appreciate my surroundings. This has been so helpful to me lately. I'm climbing out of a small depression caused by a medication problem lithium level got a bit low while tapering off another med. I'm also kind of stressed out by some life stuff outside of my control it's not terrible more just annoying but I don't like it. I kind of have to realize something always comes up. There are no perfect stretches of time where work isn't stressful a social situation isn't stressful etc. But I have a roof over my head food in my pantry and love ones around me. I want to notice that it's okay right now.There are three times when a potentially bad thing can hurt you. You can get anxious before it happens if it happens. You can have it happen. And then you can ruminate and dwell on it. I know I can't always control what happens to me but I do want to get better at reducing anxiety and rumination. When I think back on events I want to tell myself a story that is neutral not one that makes it worse. I don't want to invent problems or spin existing problems out of control. It's hard but these two things are my mental health resolutions for 2019. I want to appreciate the good moments and I want to do my best to ensure that bad ones only hurt me once.Disclaimer I'm talking about my own anxiety and rumination over small problems this isn't meant to dismiss traumatic events that you will naturally feel a lot of anxiety around and ruminate about. Terrible and traumatic things happen. This is more about not spending the entire day worrying about something inconsequential. ,Bipolar

I am finally cured of all my anxieties and feel silly for worrying about them in the first place. I spent money on hobbies I've given up on because I know I'll suddenly get good at it this time. Oh and no I don't need to see my therapist again or take my meds because I'm cured finally!But of course this lasts for maybe a week until I hit reality hard and everything takes over.

50204,I was diagnosed with Bipolar II yesterday. I guess it's my life now. Hey everyone I 18M have had a mental illness all my life. That being ADHD. I was on Medication for it for about eight years until last year when I began to feel... different.My ADHD used to consist of hyperfixation hyperactivity and inability to concentrate so normal ADHD stuff but last year before I graduated high school in May I noticed something was changing. I assumed it was my ADHD just evolving with new symptoms as I got older but towards Graduation time and shortly thereafter I realized I was wrong. It began to get worse with huge depressive episodes I would cry or feeling like crying some days and be fine the next. And I would feel worthless like I didn't mean or contribute anything and then have confidence that soared through the roof. I started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. The anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. I work retail and I've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment and then I'm super happy and energetic the next second. Even outside of work I snap at my parents my best friend and have constant negative emotions. I have started talking supersuper fast without realizing and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. MY Psych mentioned this to me yesterday. One of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. One thing I lack is impulse control I know something is wrong but I still choose to do it anyway. This has affected me with porn gaming too much and most importantly spending. I have credit cards and I paid them off a month ago and once again I have a huge balance on both because I know I shouldnt be spending money but in the moment it feels like I should. Also the lack of motivation issue is huge. I want to go to the gym I want to go out and do things but I just can't no matter how hard I force myself to try.After an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong I came clean and told her that I've been keeping how I've been feeling from her my dad sisters and my psychiatrist and therapist. I was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. My psych told me that sometimes ADHD can evolve or even be mistaken for Bipolar since the two share similar symptoms. I was put on Latuda yesterday and I feel no difference yet since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so but I'm hopeful. And hopefully I can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.,Bipolar
50377,The Daunting Task of Living Trigger warning so much sad shit mention of suicideThis last two ish years have been the worst of my life starting may 2021 my father committed suicide followed by two weeks later my 21 year old cousin this is the third family suicide. Flash forward to May 2022 I drove myself to the hospital fearing Id be alone and unable to be safe on the anniversary of his death. This is the occasion where I actually learned im bipolar and have been on the wrong meds for 12 years. Im a 34f I have lots of beautiful things about my life a husband a dog a ridiculous garden. But man I dont know how to not feel completely daunted looking both forward and back and having one really solid year of stability in my brain with various other degrees of stability but lots of struggle just to float.

49891,Changing diagnosis? No longer bipolar? HiI was first diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2019. I quickly got stable with medication until I was pregnant in 2021 and my meds were changed. It set me spiralling and I saw a new psychiatrist who again diagnosed bipolar type 2. I came off my meds for 6 months last year and stayed pretty stable other than depression. Then around Christmas time hit a manic period and saw a new psychiatrist. This time they said they weren't sure bipolar was the right diagnosis but put me on lamotrigine anyway. I've been really good on lamotrigine for a couple months but my husband spoke to my psych nurse today about maybe having some counselling and she said I don't have a diagnosis of bipolar anymore and they're treating my autism and depression. I don't know why I feel so panicked and upset by it. I think it's come out of the blue. The fact nobody has told me and they've now told my husband without even speaking to me about it. It feels like they've been sort of talking behind my back and think I'm lying or something? I don't understand how to different psychs said I'm bipolar and this new one has seen me once and changed my diagnosis.,Bipolar

I feel like I'm experiencing an completely different type of mania that is like no other... it's not super intense or anything but my risk taking behaviors are like whoa right now and I don't want to stop. It all started this weekend when I was partying which I almost never do either... drank way more than usual all weekend. Ended up experimenting with recreational drugs that I always swore I would never try. And I liked it! I also went crazy sexually and did some things I'm not very proud of but still want to do it again and the opportunity is 100 being presented to me on a gold platter.

So we had sex last night and afterwards when we were cuddling in bed he kissed me and said Im so glad youre back. I missed you. We chatted a bit more and he said hes been dodging my sexual advances because I wasnt feeling like myself and he felt wrong about pursuing anything sexual when I wasnt my exact self.

45631,Anyone else have trouble consistently taking their meds? Just last year while in jail actually after coming down from a manic episode and then spiraling further into the latter I was finally confronted again with my type 1 bipolar diagnosis. I was lit back on my meds depakote ER trazadone gabapentin and prasosin and stayed on them until being transferred to a rehab facility as a result of trauma undiagnosedmisdiagnosed bipolar I developed a really shitty and extreme addiction issues where they were hostilic and took me off my meds. One manic episode in and they made a exception for that rule quickly....lol. after that and making a timeline of my relapses and it being made clear as day that taking my meds for me is a matter of life and death because of my addiction I stayed on them and stable for a few months. I had a slip where I stopped taking my meds went manic after a week relapsed but was able to catch myself before everything went to shit...but again a few months later the same thing happened I wasn't so lucky and have been stuck in another relapse for a few months and self medicating.I now find myself very aware I need my meds. J talked to my therapist today who essentially told me that I need to accept my diagnosis and that I need to take my meds if I want to succeed based on all the past times I've tried anything otherwise. I've had intentions of calling my psych doctor I plan to but I'll pick up the phone and put it down. Or procrastinate it. When manic I'll say that it will keep me from fulfilling my purpose or take away my ability to feel fully and see the future. I KNOW I need to. I plan on calling first thing tomorrow for the first possible appointment. I want to get better. But I won't stop fucking myself over.Does anyone else have this issue? Or can relate? I'm just now starting to realize I'm not crazy or alone and it's in fact my bipolar that's effecting my life like this. And I would appreciate anyone who has similar issue's input on this.

45984,Advice The Dead Sea saltiest place on Earth second to her. New Relationship and best described as dating a pretzel... Twisted salty and I can't get enough! I'm a 22 yo Maori male and have been seeing this choice as lady for a coupley months she's 30 and deals with type 1. We just started living together and she has 2 awesome young girls who also seem to posses the ability of growing horns on command. I don't know how to explain that I enjoy playing with fire aware of getting burned. The unpredictable is such a turn on from good vibes present to more energy than a lightning storm. I haven't known her personally for long but majority of her previous relationships with family and partners has been a path of hardship through physical mental and spiritual violence... Due to their lack of understandingempathy. I'm fortunate to have personal stability and have so much stength to support this beautiful lady plenty of time for her daughters as want to provide them with the guidance and opportunities that I took for granted in whatever they wish to pursue. It's still early days and she's a really independent lady a survivor not a victim so there aren't labels yet as such as she struggles with romantic feelings as much as guys. She doesn't take meds but from previous experience they bring about a numbness. I strongly identify with spiritnatrual alternatives as a Maori not just crazy if anyone has any suggestions? At times she goes really queit and you can feel the static in the room I just haven't grasped how to bring her out of this headspace as she is so independent and hasn't had a partner that can support and just listen without anger or wanting to fix everything she keeps quiet. Her thought manifests in the environment and is like static electricity. she seems to resolve issues like a male through self reflection rather than a verbal release. Laughter seems to help so I try change her pattern of thought with humour but the downside being i dont know what's appropriate at times. Last thing I want is to come across as her mother especially since early days but I'm all about the family values and just here for support. To listen rather than reply these ears aren't painted on. If anyone has any advise on this situation dealing with my lady who could make even the devil breakdown on Jeremy Kyle. Would be much appreciated. She's so worth it without darkness we'd never appreciate how good the light is. Nothing worse than a basic btch like a challenge.,Bipolar

A reminder of how the world keeps going an example of how I need to keep continue moving forward. The world is beautiful giving me the strength to be inspired to keep flowing as the river and growth of the world. Giving myself the opportunity to watch the banana trees grow and allow myself to grow with them. The path is wet but continuing my journey because not everything is perfect. To allow myself to accept the imperfect things around me. My shoes are wet from the path but I continue anyways. Absorbing the beauty of my journey with and pushing through anyways. It will be worth it when I reach my destination. Understanding not everything cannot be perfect at all times and accepting things will be ok. Refocusing my mind on the beauty instead of complaining of the walk or my soggy shoes. Focusing on the beauty of the walk of life and connecting to the earth of my ancestors. Being able to focus on the positivity and not the negativity. Remembering not all walks of life will seem to be perfect. But focusing on the things that will bring me up. Looking at the trees and being thankful I have had the opportunity to enjoy my surroundings. Remembering to be thankful for what I have been able to experience instead of focusing on the little things that would make me uncomfortable. Thank you for letting me change my outlook. Thank you for allowing me to enjoy the peace. Thank you to my ancestors for bringing me back to peace. Thank you for allowing me to understand this is not the end.,Bipolar
46625,My Diagnosis is the worst thing to happen to me I was diagnosed a month ago after going in for a TMShttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiTranscranialmagneticstimulation consultation for what I thought was my life long clinical depression. The psychiatrist told me I was not a candidate because I was not depressed but had bipolar type 2. I got a second opinion and he also confirmed bipolar type 2. ampx200BEver since I got my diagnosis I've kinda gone off the deep end. On one side I got an answer to my problem and a potential solution. But on the other side I am now unable to see any part of me with any normalcy. Everything about me is now seen with discernment and that is causing me to lose my mind so to speak. I don't want to call it a mental health crisis but that's what it feels like.ampx200BI'm 27 and have obviously lived with this most of my life but I always just thought I had depression that I was able to come in and out of depending on my lifestyle choices and I was probably a bit ADHD loud laughed too much etc... But now when I'm in a good mood I just think I'm hypomanic.ampx200BThe doctor gave me a mood stabilizer that caused extremely vivid hallucinations and I was scared to sleep... I would stay up all night just because I knew I would wake up with crazy hallucinations I saw my girlfriend turn into a wearwolf and bite my neck. CRAZY things like that...ampx200BSo now I'm depressed and it's hard for me to work I keep having meltdowns and I don't know what to do... I'm fearing that this will ruin my career and even though I'm optimistic that I'll eventually find a drug that helps me I don't know how much time I have to get stable. Why is this happening to me just because I got a diagnosis?ampx200BI talk to my therapist and I try to go to support groups as often as possible but I don't know who else to ask... any insight would be helpful... ,Bipolar
50099,Bipolar and ADHD Im curious as to how many people have both Bipolar and ADHD do they go hand and hand?When I found out I had bipolar I soon after ended up in the hospital I was taken off of Adderall claiming its not for people with bipolar. Well its been months now on my bipolar meds and Im still struggling to focus on anything. The other day I took Adderall from my backup stash and its the first time in months I had hope. So last night I spoke to my new psych about it and shes putting me on something else cant remember the name but not Adderall. Heres hoping it works. If you take Adderall how does it make you feel? If you take something else for your ADHD please tell me more.,Bipolar
45859,My brother is manic how do I help Hi guys using a throwaway. Recently my brother got into a fight with his girlfriend and I feel like he's super manic right now. He just bought a 20000 BMW after trading in his volkswagon bought 1000 of gucci stuff traded in his phone for an iPhone X and is just acting strangely. He's being rude to my mom saying really hurtful things for no reason to her I just want to see how I can help get him back to baseline. He planned a trip with his gf to leave to Florida which had been planned back before he started acting like this and my mom and I feel nervous about him going. It's not like we can force him to stay because he's 21 he's an adult but still. All of this is really stressful for everyone involved so I wanted to see how some of you have coped with this in the past or if anyone has advice for how to help him through this. Thanks,Bipolar

12575,Just being real here. I think its really taboo to admit that COVID has had such an impact on your lives and even more taboo to put the blame where it belongs.COVID lockdowns and culture brought mine from a mild manageable depression to a pretty serious depression. I also had health conditions along with it but I think Cuomo and his lockdowns contributed massively to it. I am not sure if I will ever forgive Cuomo for this. Unfortunately I lived in New York during this time no it was the worst state in the USA to live in. I know the EU Canada and Australia have it worse and if you live in those nations I am sorry. Do you think COVID culture worsened your depression?,Depression
13437,i stared at this post for a while not typing anything. i have so much to say yet nothing to say. this is last ditch effort to see if anyone out there feels the same. I got a new job during covid i had my doubts actually everything told me not to take it felt wrong but pay was good and i was working 247 w my old job. well 4 months in i hate it i want to quit i dread the day to day. i never want to go back to the office working from home at least allows me to cry in peace. I have had anxiety but this is the first time I am saying I am depressed i want to quit. so badly i just want to quit with nothing lined up and take the time for myself to heal. but that also scares me. idk what i want anymore. i never want to go back to the office. i feel lost. and the crazy thing is i have a lot to offer i know i do but i just feel in a hamster wheel. Work is killing me,Depression

20437,Hey guys! Not sure if this is the best place for this but I am hoping to speak to a doctoral student in clinical psych. I would love to seek some professional help but cannot afford it at the moment and I definitely need to talk to somebody. A referral would be appreciated as well if you guys know anyone. Thanks guys! Looking to speak with a doctoral student,Depression
15296,I just want to make it suffer or cry. I want to hurt someone or something,Depression
17348,I have so many issues everything is a series of hoops and I am tired. When does it get better. Will I ever feel okay. I just want to be okay I just want to make them happy. They deserve the best and I am not that person right now. I fucking suck. I want to be better for my kids but it feels impossible.,Depression
20623,I am 41. Not sure exactly how I got here but I honestly feel cursed by god or the universe or whatever forces are at work. I have felt depressed for about 25 years now. And before that as a child I felt different weird isolated and alienated. I was 18 before seeking real help when someone at my university asked me Have you ever considered killing yourself? and it occurred to me that that was not normal. I have been on most of the major antidepressants. I have been hospitalized twice. I have seen countless doctors therapists psychiatrists psychologists and still I am in the same place. I have reached out to TMS and Ketamine places but have not gotten anywhere. I have tinnitus and have taken a number of blows to the head throughout my life but never been sure if its related to the depression. I have a supportive family and even a great wife and I feel terrible for relying on them so much financially and emotionally while not being able to make progress. My main problem seems to be that I do not feel like I am a part of anything that is going on. I do not understand what is going on. I do not know what I am supposed to be doing. Everything seems wrong and all I see is chaos and confusion. I am honestly trying my best to survive and thrive but it just keeps getting worse. I went to college because I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. Now I barely even enjoy films or it feels like every idea has been done. I knew I could not network or assemble a crew or any of the necessary things I would have to do. The most I was ever able to do was to make wedding videos.and hire maybe 1 other person. I decided to stop doing that got a job editing short promos for TV shows which gave me a portfolio no one seems to care about. Worked for local government creating media before getting fired for voicing concerns about noise in the office because I am so sensitive. Then with no one hiring me I had to go back to driving which I have done ever since I was able to work. I used to think driving made me feel free and I could be alone with music podcasts and my thoughts but now I do not want to be alone with my thoughts because all I think about is killing myself all day. For two years I transported dead bodies which was super depressing. Now I work for FedEx and its hot noisy and extremely strenuous. Every time someone tries to help me with a job prospect it leads nowhere to the point where I do not even want to accept the help. I have been rejected from so many places that it seems I would be qualified for. I look for jobs all the time and they all look really bad or do not pay much. And the process takes so much time only to be rejected at the end. I want to quit my job but only have spotty gig work to fall back on. I feel like a failure and that I cannot contribute financially.I do feel gratitude for the things I have. I have tried journaling meditation yoga exercise and plenty of the other things people suggest you do. But my mind stays locked on past mistakes and cringey moments. I beat the shit out of myself all day everyday and cannot stop. I compare myself to others get jealous and get angry that I cannot be normal or successful. And it feels like I am getting dumber more forgetful and harder of hearing when I need to have all my faculties working as well as possible. It just seems I am getting older and my life gets more sad and embarrassing. I barely want to leave the house because I am sensitive to the horrible things I see or situations I might end up in.I do not know what to do anymore. I am scared of getting older and how it could possibly get even worse. I need help but I cannot seem to get it. Everything is out of reach. Everything seems impossible. I have tumbled down for a long time and see no way back up,Depression
47322,solutions So when I have my real bad downs there isn't any way to just pull me out of there. I usually just sit through it. It's not nice but I can't do anything about it. Why is it that other people keep suggesting find a way out of it? It's not like I haven't tried. I get to hear that everytime I open up a bit about that topic. Then I regret doing so It feels like I'm failing at everything when they mention stuff like that. Like I'm too stupid to find a way out. How do you deal with such stuff? Do you deal with it in the first place?,Depression
38166,it wa in hope someone would come over she ghosted 0 minute after telling me she wa on her way to hang out it s been maybe hour i wa going to shrug it off but it only added to my low mood the last couple day i don t even know why i keep my hope up anymore,Depression
18436,I experience almost constant sadness and every time I try to think of or do something that makes me happy it is only temporary and all of the sad feelings and thoughts come back. I feel as if I never will be good enough for anyone or to do anything of importance. I do not have a job I stay at home and I am alone most of the time and I have no friends. I just feel so stupid and I think everyone else in my life feels the same way about me. It hurts so bad to not have any confidence in myself and to feel like I am literally worthless. I try to talk to my family but nobody understands and my husband just gets angry and frustrated with me when I try to tell him what is going on and he makes me feel like I am exaggerating or being dramatic. I am having trouble getting pregnant too and I am so scared that its all my fault and that is just another thing to add to why I feel useless as a person. I already feel like a shitty wife and if I cannot have a baby that makes me feel even worse. I hate the way I look and I even just hate my personality in general I feel like I annoy everyone I talk to and they cannot wait until I shut up and go away. I have been suicidal and self harmed but it does not make a difference. I cannot sleep I am starving myself bc I am overweight and I cry almost daily. I feel so alone. I wish somebody could understand,Depression
38344,he always seemed happy we always fucked around and had a good time we always talked about thing that bothered u but he never showed any sign that he wa upset or depressed i still sit around thinking why and can never draw any conclusion that would make sense i m slowly coming out of the mental ditch but i handled it by stuffing a much alcohol in me a possible i m coming out if that ditch but it still bum me out i completely stopped taking care of myself and the house so i decided to clean up today because i just felt happier here is what a month of cope look like http imgur com a ce x there way more trash and beer can but i wa honestly too embarrassed to even show the rest glad to finally slowly be getting better,Depression
9061,So I am not exactly suicidal but I just do not feel like being alive. I am only 18 and this is my 2nd time going through some serious trama a few years ago my best friend took her own life and I got help for that but now I got this other type of trama that most do not even consider trama. it is called betral trama it happens when someone your super close to does something that is unforgivable to you but unlike normal PTSD you have this need to be around them. And it can come from a parent or a relationship mine is from a relationship. I used to be able to meditate and when I meditate I sometimes go into sleep paralysis so... Not the best time to have flashbacks everytime. But I am in this pretty constant state of hopelessness to where I am constantly wishing I was not alive but I do not really want to die and I do not want my ex back but also do even tho I know how toxic and inconsiderate she was. But I am just wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can do to get rid of these feelings because I cannot keep living like this it is been a month and I still have no clue what to do. Idk what to do,Depression

14216,At the end of every day I try look back to see what I achieved that day. I do not have a job I am completely broke. I do not have any friends anymore. At the end of most days I have done nothing made no memories. Even when I get a few things done on learn a thing or two I still feel worthless. Nothing I do matters. I will always end up putting effort into unproductive things. I suffer excruciating loneliness severe lack of self esteem. I feel like I have completely missed out on everything. Honestly wish I would somehow just not exist anymore. I hate how I am living,Depression
23548,Nobody responded to my earlier post so I am going to shorten it. In the last few years I lost my house that I owned my beloved cats through tragedy my job and my health.

I Lost Everything I Had,Depression

14550,Please let me preface this by saying I am not trying to insult anyone or flex or brag and I am very aware a lot of people are less fortunate than me. I work 3 jobs 7 days a week 60 or so hours a week. I pull in. 2400 a month sometimes up to 3000 and have done so for the last year. My monthly expenses come to about 1700 a month and yet I never have more that 300 or so in my account unless I plan on buying something big. Last year it was 1200 on flight sim controls I think I have used like 10 times since I bought them. I have slowly added more pieces to a drum kit I can hardly play I just rebuilt a new computer two months ago and last week I bought a 3D printer to make DnD minis. It was not until two days ago when I started looking for a bigger new computer case for my just built rig that I realized that I am just spending money to buy stuff I do not need.I think I am doing this because I constantly feel lonely. No significant other and I do not really socialize outside of work. Does anyone else spend money on expensive things like this? Again sorry if it sounds like I am bragging. Spending money to fill the hole??,Depression
8232,Hey guys for a long time now I have been feeling really bad about myself after a lot of negativity I have 0 self confidence and its always such an effort having a decent conversation with someone I always worry about if I am too awkward or stupid and just end up a mess in the process. When it comes to relationships none have ever worked out they were always pretty awkward and never lasted long I blame myself for it to be honest. Even after 10 months of gym and people telling me I look great I never feel good enough and I doubt I ever will. All in all I just feel terrible about myself. I have school in less than a month and I am turning 14 pretty soon its sad that life goes so fast I miss being happy and not caring about every tiny thing I do. I have not really talked about this kind of stuff ever so that is why I am saying it here. Hopefully someone understands me I am going to go sleep soon since its pretty late goodnight God bless. Low self esteem sucks ,Depression
39873,i m a frequent poster here i ve struggled all my life with these feeling thing seemed like they were getting better i wa genuinely happy and then it got taken away again i live in shitty section housing i wa kicked out several year ago and i ve been struggling to stay afloat since my mother and i recently discussed me moving back home which wa le than ideal she bought a condo and offered it to me she even suggested i get a roommate i wa overjoyed my so could move in my best friend could move it it seemed wonderful and then once i already signed the paper to move out in two month my mother told me to stop looking for a roommate she ha been considering moving into the larger bedroom and taking my kid sister with her leaving me alone in the smaller bedroom with no support and i have no place to argue against this she bought me a new car a an early birthday gift she s paying for me to go through school i m currently struggling to keep my grade up and she s rightfully angry about it my apartment is messy and she s mad about that too rightfully so i am going to lose my privacy and be stuck in the tiny condo with her without support from my so and my best friend my mother is very controlling so i know i won t be able to play video game or talk to my friend in peace it ll just be lecturing do your homework look for a better job etc etc i don t have the motivation for either i barely have motivation to go to my current job she doesn t get that i m so incredibly depressed and suicidal every single fucking day i just got rejected for a better job and now on top of all that i ll be stuck in a confined space with her with no freedom again and i ll probably become babysitter again for the child i pretty much raised for her it s not fair,Depression
21792,How are you guys and gals getting hooked up with people? Maybe I am socially retarded but I have never had a girl ask me out and I do not know how to ask one out. I do not bother because I do not have a job and quite honestly I just get the feeling that everyone would be better without me. Even though I feel this way it saddens me that I am alone. MDD makes it incredibly difficult to see what makes me happy. I have spent my entire adult life in my room I am not kidding like never going outside getting a job cleaning nothing. I am just here there is nothing that drives me so I do not bother trying. I want to do stuff but I feel everything is too slow and that I have to try and catch up for all the time I have wasted being an idiot. I am not very attractive when I think I am a stupid worthless sorry excuse for a human being. I feel like a parasite. My personality is being depressed and addicted to videogames like who would want to offer this person a job or go out with them? What the hell do I do? I do not know where to start the hole I have dug is so deep that I cannot even fathom reaching the top. Money is an issue and I feel it is the root of most of my problems.Aw man reading this back just makes me realize how undesirable I must appear to people my inner thoughts speak the truth and I hate it. What could I possibly do to turn this around? What do I do?,Depression

47762,Back in this stupid lonely hole with no one to share my thoughts with Sorry In advanced for the rant of anyone even reads this lol 19m I used to use this app a lot to talk people out of hurting themselves or give people a chance to vent when I was really depressed as a coping mechanism I guess. I started feeling better as I graduated high school with honors and began moving towards an exciting and new time in my life. There were ups and downs sure but I was probably happier than Ive been in years since entering college. I found new hobbies met amazing friends worked out etc I even finished the semester with all As. Thats why it hurts even more to still be in this place. Nearly all of my online friends ditched me like they always do half of my real life friends just stopped showing any interest In me I cant find a reason to give af about school and Ive stopped all but one of my hobbies piano. Its like once I get a taste of feeling okay everything falls apart and I know what I need to do to fix it but I just feel so alone and I need so badly to share my thoughts with someone but despite being in a school of ten thousand plus people theres not one person I feel okay turning to for help. I just want it to end it never gets better and it hurts so much because I have a lot of love for other people and I just never seem to have that love reciprocated. I never leave anyone but people always get bored of me and move on to the next. I just want someone to love me man,Depression

8578,Hi everyone this is my first post here and I am just feeling so tired and unmotivated. I do not even feel like going to my therapist anymore. I feel pathetic saying its too much effort because its literally over zoom but its just too much. I do not feel like talking about my problems anymore. I just feel like forgetting about them. she is a lovely therapist but I just do not want to deal with this anymore. I just feel so sad lately its almost becoming to the point of numbness. Luckily I do not live with my parents anymore so they do not physically notice. I barely shower anymore unless I have to. I hate brushing my teeth my room and bathroom are disgusting I cannot even find the motivation to make myself food anymore. I am in so much debt right now and my boss was talking to me about getting a promotion at work and then she just went over and handed it to someone else. I just want to disappear. Not even necessarily wanting to die but I just want to be gone and not have to deal with my life anymore. Just so tired,Depression
24449,it is completely out of the blue now...usually I am reminded of something or I will see something random and I will just start to tear up in front of people for absolutely no reason. I am usually very tethered but lately I am just so tired...I am so tired of living and I would never have the guts to kill myself...but every morning I wake up with such incredible sadness amp I wish I would never been born in the first place. It just seems like nothing ever goes my way and it is getting worse. It feels like I have never been really happy and usually I will drown it out with friends but now even that does not work. I cannot afford therapy and I do not know what to do. I just wish I could not feel anything again. I have began to publically cry,Depression

20768,As a brief background I know I have had depression for many years I am 21 now but the last year or so has been constant. I also self hrm quite regularly not really badly tho. I know many people suffer worse than me but I feel like I have gotten to the point that I would consider doing something about it to stop it getting really bad. But that terrifies me.I have terrible social anxiety and cannot even tell my mum she is involved in stuff so it would be hard to discuss things too. But I really want to tell my best friend I have had since primary school. We do not see much of each other anymore since she went to university but she is back home for the summer and I have invited her to a concert and to sleep over at my house after. I think it will be good for me to have some company for once. I trust her 100 and know she would be sympathetic and maybe she is even had depression too. I just find it so hard to bring things up when I know it could make them feel awkward and I do not want to put a downer on the weekend. But I know if I do not say something now I will never tell anyone. I was thinking of telling her after the concert when we are chatting before going to sleep as you always do on a sleepover. I just do not know how to bring it up or what to say. I do not want it to sound attention seeking either. I am not expecting her to do anything I just want someone to know. Advice needed about opening up,Depression

I was doing terrible but slowly and steadily getting out of this episode until yesterday and today and I am back to feeling like shit. Yesterday I ate my first meal in 6 days and today I just cannot bring myself to eat. I cannot look in a mirror. I am thinking about leaving all my groupchats with my friends. I cannot drink anything. Getting out of bed is a difficult. I have been playing sims and watching tv shows I like like Key and Peele and The Boondocks but I am starting to lose motivation for that too. I am so tired. Everything hurts and I am just tired. All I have the will power to do right now is play the sims turn on the tv cry and occasionally use the bathroom.

18178,I do not know if people could understand me but while people are busy with their life trying to reach their dreams learning improving and spend their time having friends and love ones. I was focus in trying to find ways to end my life I did not try to remember peoples names or to try to make a lot of friends to study hard to compete or to have fun with friends. I could not remember my teachers name even the places I have been the people I have met I did not bother to remember them because I was thinking that it would be useless because I wanted to die anyways.. and now that I am on my twenties and there are times when I feel better and wanted to go forward.. I cannot because i did not know how to live like a normal human being.. I feel like I did not know anything and wasted years in my life not learning about life.. and now that I wanted to live sometimes.. I cannot and I do not know how. I feel like an alien seeing other people and try mimicking how they do things even though I cannot fully understand..I am different because my sole purpose was to die while everyone else wants to live How to live,Depression

25554,Hello to whoever's reading this. Just a little something about meHI I am Noah I am 15 years old. I live in a place outside of a city called Manchester in the NorthWest of England. I do not have any hobbies I just sit in my bedroom all day. Bored wondering if this life is even worth living anymore. Where I live is dull and depressing. I live in a small box house shit weather nearly all year round it is not particularly clean. People do not seem to have a smile on their faces at all. My parents are both clueless and do not understand how I feel when I gain the courage to come out to them about my emotions. The old activities I used to do no longer interest me. Gaming photography going to watch a Football team called Manchester City play going on walks. I sometimes drink or cut to relive some of the pain but everything just seems black and white. Everyone else's life seems so much better than mine. Everyone seems to have hobbies success wealth loving and understanding parents family very rare occasions where they are in a bad mood.My girlfriend Farrah has helped me through my depressive episodes.Just a little about her she is 15 years old. She lives in the US Tennessee. In a huge house with a large loving supportive family. Her and her family is full of success. She has hobbies like basketball and softball she is very sociable and understanding she is going to the best high school in her state. she is very lucky to live the life she has but I think she just takes it for granted. She is so precious and beautiful. she is perfect to me. She is the reason I am still alive today. Sometimes possibly due to my depression at an instant I can just Turn off even at little triggers or at random sometimes. I feel my emotions can sometimes hurt her due to her living such a perfect ideal lifestyle. She already had a car by the time she was 14 so I guess that puts it into perspective how amazing her life is. We both live in completely different areas we are opposites in personality so I just sometimes think she does not understand what its like to be me. When I cut myself. it hurts her. When I drink. It hurts her. When I talk to her about my emotions she says it does not hurt her but deep down I feel it does I do not want to be the one ruining her mood or life when it is absolutely perfect to me. I do not want to spoil that for her. I just really need help. I cannot stop worrying about how I am possibly affecting her. I need to find ways to stop making shit so boring I just need help because I do not see myself living any longer with these kinds of emotions affecting me. I need a way to find the colour in life.Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Sorry if this did not make sense or if it sounded rushed. I just wanted to get it out there and for someone to listen to. Thank you. Why is everything so boring dull and meaningless?,Depression

11265,I am Mnearly 22 because I am born December 1999 also I am ashamed of my depression because it is unmanly0 I have been living with depression since 2012 where it got worse every year until 2015 where I had multiple failed suicide attempts not really manly I know. After that it now comes in episodes. Sometimes these episodes are extreme like right now because I have lost a family people on tumblr spread false information about me witch hunt me I am all alone and I am getting doxxed medium or mild. Also there is my dysphoria and paranoia mixed up in this as well. Before I tell you my whole life story I keep it short Yes I have been to a psychologist but it is not possible due to Covid at the moment. And I never had any friends in my life as people rather liked to bully me and physically hurt me that is why I am glad I am out of school for so many years now and almost got me killed once by throwing me in front of a bus. Anyways I noticed that my eyesight got worse and worse over the years. Can it be because of depression or because I stay up all night I am very nocturnal for years now? I had a sharp crisp eyesight a few years ago where I couldf see details 10m away but now I cannot even Identify faces anymore from one meters. sorry for using the metric system I am not american I am scared to go blind. Additonal Note My hearing is actually my greatest strenght and the only sense left that is close to superhuman as proven by multiple tests in the past that I took. I do not like to mention it because it is considered cringe and unnormal and I am very ashamed of it but the hearing thing might be because of my autism.

17365,I have been suffering from depression nearly my whole life with many ups and downs throughout the years but I have found myself in a down time lately. I am having a hard time showering cleaning cooking basically all self care. I also have adhd so my executive dysfunction makes it hard to start tasks even with medication. Does anyone have any goto meals something that I could assemble in the fewest possible steps that would provide adequate nutrition? I know not getting enough healthy food and water only contributes to how awful I feel but my normal goto's are not working very well for me. I have been ordering delivery way too often and it is always sugary things. I need to care for my physical health more as I am sure it is contributing to my exhaustion but my appetite is so low due to my medication I have been eating way too many sugary things and my face is breaking out which is bad for my skinpicking compulsions. there is a lot of issues all piling on me at once in addition to a major life change so I am just trying to get through this as painlessly as possible any help or just ideas or anything you have to contribute would be great. thanks Help eating decent meals,Depression

Then to top it off she experienced everything that I do feeling restless little to no sleep and always nervous. Then she had the nerve to complain to me about it and get back with him not even a month later. For ten years that man scared me to the point where I did not want to be in the same room as him and when I finally felt free from worrying about being yelled at or having to hear the dogs get beaten she pulls him right back into our life telling me one day I am going to understand. a bunch of other stupid stuff.

All my friends and family say it is going to be fine but my depressed brain does not believe them. To make matters worse I already quit my other job once I got this job because they needed me to start in August. If I do not get this job I do not know what I am going to do. I literally just laid in bed all day today. I was so looking forward to having a break but now I do not even know if I will be getting the new job. All I wanted was a month off to do what I wanted knowing I would be okay but now I cannot even enjoy the time because I am so worried about not getting the job because of this dumb fucking background check typo.

20485,I am 23 and I have been battling with depression since 20089 but was not officially diagnosed until 2018 when I decided to finally get help. For the longest time I was terrified because of the stigma behind mental illness. I did not want to be seen as less than just because of my depression. There is so much that has contributed to my depression that I do not know what it is anymore. Between being bullied in school and at home to growing up in a violent household to being sexually assaulted at 17 to the loads of bullshit my father put me through then leaving and not having anything to do with me and so much more its all been bottled up so much. All I want to do is isolate away from family and friends. I do not want anything to do with anyone anymore and its hard for me to hold a conversation. I am surprised I have been making straight As in college I am working on my second college degree and a 4.0 GPA with all of this going on but to me that does not help or validate me in any way. I feel so lost and I feel like suicide is my only way out but I cannot do that. I have a 2 year old daughter who needs me to stick around and the ONLY reason I have not attempted to take my life in the last two years I have had failed attempts is because of her and only her. I just do not know what to do anymore.. I am losing..,Depression
23268,I do not want to bother normal people anymore I just cannot think of positivity i know existing and hardship are somehow a twin majestic disaster but everything is overwhelming. Everything is a great regret the things that I wanted turns out to drain out of me and the dreams that only keeps me alive has vanished to the unknown. I wanted to feel every second like before appreciate the air that I breath but at the same time I just want to suffocate myself and cease my existence. Where did I go wrong? Or was I in the wrong side all through out? Have I been forcing myself too much or this is just normal? I do not know anymore. I am at 20's but it turns out that I stare into someone I do not know. Running in circles,Depression
11799,I am a disappointment to so many people. My life is shit and I am shit and always will be. Eventually depression will win and that will be it forever. So tired of being in pain all the time and living in this hate filled world. Every second of every day I just want to cry but have no one safe to turn to I will not matter,Depression
10047,I feel like I have been on the edge for several weeks now. Stress at work has been mounting up and unfortunately my brain is wired so that if I do one thing wrong then that must mean I cannot do anything right. I always thought its weird that I can look at those thoughts and realize they are false but I cannot ever shake them. The lack of any friends or support group just means I have been internalizing and ruminating on all my negative emotions again and for the past few weeks I have felt like I could break out in tears at any second. The loneliness I have in life is near crippling but I do not want to complain any more about it on this board than I already have.Anyways today I started playing an old game that I used to watch my parents play as a little kid Tomb Raider II if anyone is curious just for the nostalgia value and something about it just hit me really hard. Just all these feelings came flooding back memories of pure contentment and not having to worry about anything. Being surrounded by people that love me and not having to be concerned about going to work tomorrow or paying bills or trying to save more money. I realized today that those days and feelings are gone and they will not be coming back. I guess realizing that was my tipping point because I have been crying off and on all day now. I am just so exhausted. I want to give up so badly but it would devastate my parents if I was gone. Can someone please just tell me things will be okay? Life is so awful right now and I am trying to be strong but it feels like I am fighting a losing battle..Sorry if this is disjointed or all over the place. I am so overwhelmed and I am not good at putting what I am feeling into words sometimes. Just had my first breakdown in awhile. I am so tired I want this all to be over.,Depression

10832,Growing up my brother was insecure about being inferior to me and hated me. He made our parents believe that I was bullying him which is far from the truth I have always loved my bro but he could not help himself. I was constantly berated and no one listened to me when I had problems. I did poorly in school starting out and my mom often said that I would be out on the streets if I kept it up.I was a pretty weird kid entering school. I eventually figured out if I was funny people would tend to like me but that is really as deep as my connections ever went. I was molested by a school friend's older brother which is something I have never told another soul. It seems like I have a pattern of people making fun of me and trying to take advantage of me. I am not perfect but I try my best to be kind and accepting of people.That being said I do not have much trust in confiding in or forming new connections. Luckily I have always been pretty resilient. Though I have struggled with substance abuse in the past I am in a pretty good spot now concerning my career and physical health. I even managed to still have a few friends that I occasionally do things with but I still have trouble forming deeper connections.My family life has improved as everyone matured. But there is loneliness and I cannot get over the wall I have set up to really go about fixing that. I have been really focusing on myself for the past 5 years or so and while it has done me a lot of good I feel extremely alone with it all. I find it really hard to trust other people,Depression
24005,Started a 95 a few days ago that is an engineering placement for my university degree. The only thing is I have quickly realised that I cannot sit at a desk for 8 hours a day and actually just want to cry whenever I get home thinking I have got to go back there the next day. The work environment is really quiet so there is not really much interaction with others and I have just been sat at a desk for 8 hours everyday with my thoughts.I cannot cope with thinking this is my life for the next year waking up at 630am getting ready going to work for 8 hours which is boring and soul sucking then going home and not being able to do anythingenjoy anything because I am dreading coming to work the next day. Its only been three days but I cannot wait for this year to end. I may have the option to stop the placement but that will not stand good with the company or university I feel that working 8 hours a day is wasting my life and thinking I am going to be doing this for the rest of my life makes me just fall down this hole of thinking I have made the wrong choices in life in terms of career path. Started a 95 I cannot cope,Depression
18169,As the title says I am looking for a job and the jobs that provide some semblance of a work life balance and are actually in my field do not care. Sales and manager jobs are there but they expect you to pretty much give up your entire life and that makes me feel suicidal and unhappy. Help! Overwhelmed and Depressed Over Job Market,Depression
38976,nothing freak me out more then when i get that stabbing pain in my chest i m it s my anxiety all my test are good i am healthy dr said many i have inflammation in my chest but reading in here that other people get chest pain to helped me pea together that it s my anxiety i ve had anxiety my whole like started getting medicine for it year ago med work at first then stop i just took a fast acting pill bc the anxiety wa so bad it s hard to focus but i try and distracted myself by reading i just want a normal day,Depression
17560,I tried contacting my local hospital's mental health services I called the secretary and she tell me to fuck off and put the phone down already a great start for somebody with depression and issues with self harm.After a lengthy call with the public relations office I manage to get thru to the nurses at the mental health department.They tell me that they are still going through appointments from November 2020 so it is going to be fun to wait and see everything going down the shitter even more... One step forward 2 steps back,Depression
25940,I wanted to get this off my chest. I am so tired. I am tired of trying so hard and feeling like its not going anywhere. Today my professor accused me of cheating I am a pre nursing major. And if that goes on my permanent record then I will never get into nursing school. And no i did not cheat. I spend 40 plus hours on this class every week. I am so done with the education system. Its so wack. I cannot even fight my case. This sent me spiraling today. My immediate thought was well this is it. Just like that my career is over before even starting it. School was my last glimmer of hope for my future. This was the only thing keeping me going. I do not know what do now. I keep thinking of ways to end it now. And i do not see a way out of this. I do not want to exist anymore. I just lost everything. I have no way to prove anything. I am tired i was 3 classes away from completing my pre reqs. I am an A student. And just like that its all gone. All of my hard work is gone. I hate you Dr. B. This was my last thing. This was it for me. This is all i had left. And its gone. I love school. I really wanted to be a nurse. But it just got taken from me. And I did not do anything wrong. Fuck the education system. I paid for it out of pocket. I worked my ass off to be here. Goodbye. I do not want to exist anymore. I am tired,Depression
38276,sometimes my life seems great and i tend to blow off my emotion to make myself feel better about my current situation right after graduating college with honor i suddenly wa hit the truth about adulthood expectation weren t suddenly brought up to my face and if i wanted to improve it wa completely up to myself if i wanted to reach it yet i wa complacent i started drinking heavily since i couldn t depend on weed anymore due to my job search which lead to me getting arrested for a dwi which resulted in me getting fired from my job 000 dollar later i met a woman that made me happy with who i wa and what i stood for and i m about to start a job at a national bank more recently we ve started getting into fight and she want me to get mad at her but i start falling in a self pity party and instead of getting mad at her i tell myself i deserve every bit of anger coming out of her i cower and just want thing to start getting better emotionally and don t know how to get there,Depression
23141,I get so angry and sad all of the time to the point where it does not even feel like I am me. I think about ending it sometimes just because I do not want to bring this on my friends and family. it is not me. But it is becoming me. I have had a migraine for 12hrs and I cannot sleep. It just fucking sucks. I just want to be healthy. I feel like I have a corrupted mind,Depression
20928,I am extremely ugly and have basically no self confidence. I rarely talk to girls I am in my early 20s and male and honestly wish I just had a friend that was a girl or a girlfriend. I just want a hug I do not even care about anything besides that. I just want to hug a girl,Depression
7129,2 years ago I was at least semihappy playing one of my favourite games but now the game went to shit and I do not have anything else. Wish I could just go backIm also scared about failing college I do not feel ready for the real world at all yet. Nothing makes me happy anymore,Depression
37746,my depression ha been at it worst this year after suffering some significant loss i m going to college in the fall and i want to look forward to it but i cant i chose a state school so i wouldnt have debt and figured i d find a way to pay for it easily all my plan fell through and i only have a couple thousand in scholarship nowhere near enough to cover it i missed so many deadline and screwed up so much because i have no one to help me in my life no reliable adult or friend one of my best friend wa awarded a full tuition scholarship and i want to be overjoyed for her but i just feel so horrible about myself i tried so hard in high school with my grade and music and it amounted to nothing thousand dollar in scholarship is all i have to show for it i cant get any help from fafsa and i have a job but working is horrible when i can barely get out of bed how do i keep going when i have no one to support me and nothing to keep going for,Depression
20308,I hate it when a person finally has the courage to open up about how their feeling and someone will say remember someone always has it worse than you making them feel that their issues are invalid so they burry it back in the dark corner of their brain instead of talking about it. The first person I opened up about cutting used the famous phrase. It made me feel like an annoying complainer. So I continued cutting and it was not until almost a year later I regained the confidence to talk to someone else who helped me greatly. So if you use the phrase even though your intentions are to do good. Please stop. The phrase someone always has it worse than you annoys me so much.,Depression
15765,Almost all throughout life any major and even plenty of minor decisions about education careers relationships family substance use even what to eat when to show up and when to sleep. I always pick the worst decisions that because the most pain and misery. And it is never a surprise I make these choices constantly knowing full well it is the worst path. I feel like I am playing a game and my character is bugged to take bad traits and debuffs and speech options. Yet still I will do it again and again and again throwing away anything good or chances at being happy. I know what is good for me and I avoid or self destruct it. The relationships that were good for me whether family friends intimatesexual girlfriends I destroy and the ones that are toxic and bad I tend to. There have been plenty of good and loving caring people that a few still try to help me and yet I push them away. I have hurt people on deep levels and yet they forgive and I disappoint. I just feel broken and hopeless.Sorry if it is all over the place I needed to say something is for myself. Why do I always make the worst choices,Depression
40502,literally and the depression that come before,Depression
18180,I am sure at least some of you might have experienced this in the past or currently. I feel emotionally numb to the point where i feel like my family would be better off without me. As many of you have already expressed i do not want to kill myself but would not mind at all being dead. Yes i have thought about maybe doing it myself before but currently I am not in that phase. I just started meds a little over a week ago so hopefully this gets better but it is rough to be with your awesome family and feel nothing at all. Like i know i love them but cannot show it and when i try to show it i feel like it is looks forced. Does this go away with meds? Does it get better? Anything that helped you? Thank you in advance. Hope your day is a wonderful one. Emotionally Numb,Depression
25579,Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Everywhere I turn I get burned. I hate myself I hate fucking people. I hate all the bitches who thought I was too unstable to be with them when their love would have made me stable. Fuck myself for never being able to do anything. Fuck my grandparents for not letting me use drugs. Fuck regular jobs. Fuck covid. Fuck Dora the explorer. Fuck everything. Fuck my inability to find what I love and the drive to pursue it. Fuck my mum for being a drug addict and getting deported when I was 2. Fuck my dad for not letting me live with him because he cannot handle his marriage. Fuck my first ex for not taking me back. Fuck the government for not making all drugs free. Fuck my brain for not being happy. Fuck all the cunts who dipped on me. Fuck all the boring basic cunts out there. Fuck people who cannot think you can achieve great things. Fuckkk,Depression
39841,it s that bad,Depression
23116,I think I may be depressed. I just cannot get out of bed I have nothing to do outside of it. I have been isolated from friends for almost 4 years I have only internet friends now. I do not have a job since I am underage I do not have friends to go out with and I do not have pets to walk. I have been having thoughts about not existing and how that would be better than living life and dealing with responsibilities or people not suicide just disappearing. I cannot get up to exercise to go out and I will always postpone everything the hardest I can I have not cut my hair in 2 years which I have never done before and if I have the option to stay home instead of going out I will stay home. Also sometimes I feel like I am just a spectator and not the protagonist of my life. I feel so indifferent about some things and sometimes it seems like I am just watching a movie or playing a game. here is the catch I am not sad. I do not experience long periods of sadness I do not cry at night I do not even feel down I am either happy or neutral happy most of the time and sometimes only the thought of living fills me with joy. I have never seen it as depression and thought it was a phase but not getting out of bed for a week straight does not seem normal for a healthy 17yo. Does someone relate? Have you seen this? Am I not depressed and making this up? Maybe I am just super lazy? What the fuck is wrong with me??? Depression without sadness?,Depression

51563,How to cope with shame Hello I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame shame of what I did in a specific moment shame of how I reacted what I've said shame on how I was dressed the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things because anything material has more value than me . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things. ampx200BHow do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life? When I remember one time I start remembering the others they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence that they already happened that there is no way I could live with those things that happened. I feel shame from myself all the time but when those memories come to me I want to snap out of existence. I don't know how to deal with that. Thank you.,Personality-disorder
51572,Societal Standards Not sure if this is just me but the more I self reflect the more i realize that im unhealthily antisocial but ok with that until i feel societal pressure to be different. Ive always been a loner and i can be like that ALL the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who arent like that and find it weird. Its almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because thats what you need for a happy life apparently but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure theres literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess Im deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and cant relate to others and feel insecure about it like I wish I could be in the standard of whats normal but Im also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy its hard to put into words how I feel but its like Im so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people dont live their lives like that. I dont want to miss out but find it hard to change. I guess my behavior isnt normal but trying to fit in just makes my anxiety so bad. Hopefully somebody understands what I mean.

51218,does anybody else get overly hurt and offended when somebody comments about how quiet you are? Ive been the quiet girl my entire life and I cannot tell you how many times during school and now work Ive heard people tell me how quiet I am. One of my teachers once called me the quietest girl theyd ever known and I would always get called a mute or asked if I ever talked. And I cant explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it I have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off. I dont even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse. I would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me theres something wrong with me over and over and its all I can think about. I hate it. I know Im not normal I know Im quiet I know I dont talk much so why does it hurt so much when someone tells me that?,Personality-disorder

50551,how to get over fear of therapygetting help i'm 18 and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but i'm so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as 'what if i misinterpret a question and answer wrong' or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful. i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist. i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it. i want help and i don't want things to get worse but i don't know how to go about it. any advice on how to overcome this fear or services available that i should start with?i'm from the uk btw,Personality-disorder
51374,Get angry because of noisy people do you guys feel that? My cousins 1416y often come to my house they are pretty noisy at night and i like to go to bed early so it bothers me. I tell them to be quiet but soon they are making a lot of noise again. Sometimes i went up to them and scold them sometimes even calling them names such was the anger. My mother says that I am not very understanding and very hard on them. I feel like I got a little bit of the avoidant trait from her personality.I'm not diagnosed with AvPD but i'm pretty sure that i have it.

51030,Speaking my mind when talking to my therapist I have no problem with being open and honest with my therapist. But no matter what I say I never feel like anything I ever say is true. I can talk about how sad I feel or what it feels like to have a conversation but somehow my brain always wants me to think that Im making stuff up or something. I have so many conversations in my head where I feel like Im able to express myself fully. But once Im talking to my therapist or anyone else for that matter its all just nonsense. It just makes me feel so god damn lonely and stupid.So I told my therapist about this and she suggested I make a recording or write whatever I want to say down so that I can express myself more fully.

51311,Trouble saying I love you Just curious about this. I've noticed in myself that while I can say it to my family members I have trouble saying it to anyone else. I have a few close friends in particular who say it a lot to me and to one another and I just can't say it back for some reason. And it's not that I don't care about my friends it's just some mental block in my head I guess. Saying it to parents or siblings feels more automatic in a way I guess and is therefore less uncomfortable. Such as ending a phone call with love you bye love you too bye.

51394,Does anyone else here want a loving caring close relationship but at the same time just cant get comfortable with the idea of being with someone else? Im 28 and soon to be 29. Due to childhood trauma abuse and neglect I grew very up lonely and to this day have never been in a relationship. I tried online dating and met a few people. Unfortunately no one panned out. While Ill admit I wasnt interested in any of them I also just find myself feeling uncomfortable being with someone who knows your close personal life. Ive never really had a close relationship with anyone my whole life. Ive always been a loner and its been my comfort zone. I fantasize and would just love to have a partner who I can spend time with. But I have so little confidence and so worried about being judged that I just cant put in the effort to start a serious relationship. Im a weird loser with no friends and no hobbies even if I have a good career and ok life otherwise. Being close with someone else makes me feel so uncomfortable. I also get exhausted by look at what it takes to maintain a relationship. Im hoping I can get over this one day. Anyone else feel the same way?,Personality-disorder
51483,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned in a western country and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling...

51109,Rising anxiety I don't know why I'm writing this Im just feel so anxious rn. I'm worrying about everything. I don't think any of this ends well for me. It's not getting better it's just getting worse everyday. During the day I'm ok but at night when I'm alone and have no distractions I feel scared and anxious. I realize I'm alone and I'll most likely always be alone. I can't be around people when I'm like this I self isolate even harder when I'm hurting. There's a really bad feeling in my stomach rn I feel so strange. I think there's something wrong with me. I'm not good enough in anything. I'm legitimately the worst human being to exist. Why tf am I still here none of this ends well. I'm just so tired n even when I sleep I wake up tired. I wanna escape this but I don't know how. I can't do this. I'm not worthy of existing. Fuckin hell I think about dying most days but I don't want to. I really wanna live a happy life with people in it. But there's so much I can't control. My brain is always trying to fuck me over.

Maybe you can relate.I quit my job and my appartment. I left my cozy first world country with a one way ticket to India. Currently I am touring Rajestan on a motorcycle. The only contact to my old life is my family. Even though I would like to cut contact I can't bring myself to do it. It would break my mothers heart.I eat way too much seriously the food is amazing and get stared and begged at alot because i am a western guy. Some days I don't leave my hotel room. Other days I drive 300km on busy roads. You probably know this feeling. The ambivalence is killing me. I love being alone but at the same time I miss not being alone. And often I think doing this was a big mistake. The whole experience is.. meh.. And because I dont know where to go or what to do planning anything is impossible. Right now I have 50k in savings.

But when I'm suppised to be part of a group I start to feel inferior to others and that I don't belong. Everyone else is interacting with each other but somehow I am left outside the group. The school and Uni were propably the worst because you are alone amongst everybody else everyday. In my current work everything is okay because I work from home and I don't see the others interacting all the time. I just pretend that everyone else is doing their work alone same as me. But. Now we have this group work at my work and now I feel alone again. We should be interacting with each other but I'm not interacting with anyone.

50531,Storytime... Hey so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there most of us are still there let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. Alright so I was showering thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!So basically I'm part of a church group and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't liketrust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. Though I don't share everything these people are genuine and kind and they always make me feel safe. It's just that I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me. So as part of going on the trip I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team 9 people including me. I trust love and feel safe with everyone on this team and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. Anyways the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small mostly funny slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles my past my family all of it. And these are my friends they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though the medicine is kind of iffy really. Anyways I'm super anxious about it especially since I did something similar last year but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year I was so empty and emotionless. But of course nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. But it's not like that that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy. I'm much better now but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay but as soon as I was behind closed doors I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though everyone of us is sharing our testimony no matter how much it hurts we're going to be here for each other.If you've actually read this far I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.,Personality-disorder
51304,Is anyone else ashamed of their face? I hate my face and the fact that people can see me Ive been told I have a decent looking face and good features but it doesnt matter my own mental image of myself is still awful I think of myself like im deformed or have severe facial scarring or something. Its like an inherent and irrational feeling of shame and guilt a constant voice in my head telling me to hide my face that other people will judge me or laugh at me for how bad i lookWhen everybody had to wear face masks I felt great. I was a little more confident going into public spaces and talking to people because I knew they couldnt see my face and what I looked like it felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders now nobody wears them though so I generally wear a hood or hat whenever I leave the house it just makes me feel much more comfortable. I think thats also why eye contact is so difficult because when theyre staring into your eyes it feels like theyre looking right at you judging you theyre able to see your whole faceIdk why I even wrote this just wondered if anyone else feels the same even though its totally irrational and theres no reason to I just cant get rid of the feeling of hating everything about myself feeling ashamed of it all though mainly my face,Personality-disorder
51468,Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I selfdiagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic paranoid insecure and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my trauma is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did but they felt really sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself and nobody did for me.This person lashed out at me calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and honestly that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.This person wasn't wrong but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back it felt nasty and unwarranted.Still though it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends a few years since those bad exchanges occured and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my selfesteem and it still does.When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like I wanna die to myself like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more normal again though.Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered offtopic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.,Personality-disorder

51517,Lack of opinion and interest in things Anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? New show comes out new game comes out new trend im always late to it all. I always find myself saying the phrase thats a thing? when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else hasI seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is I hate it and 10 is I love this and will skip sleep to do it the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I love. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times Im just not that into it as the people around me. One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea but like this happens with everything I tryOr when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just heard was a highly paid major without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking what jobs it would train me for hell whether or not I even liked it. It was just ok sounds good. One of the most important decisions of my life made in 10 minutes. And now senior year I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.Makes me think about how many opportunities Ive missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life. IdkI'm asking on this sub mostly because I'm curious if this is related to avpd or not. Or if its more a personality thing,Personality-disorder
50951,A quote from another sub... gtMy therapist taught me how to talk to people and also told me what other people usually thought compared to what I believed they were thinking. I viewed people just as evil as my inner self hate talk and they arent that judgmental. They care more about how they come off than how you are. gt gtWe just created this super judgmental mindset and we think everyone is just as judgmental as we are to ourselves. gt gtYou have to also train your brain to be nicer to yourself and not blame yourself when you feel down about something.,Personality-disorder

50651,Feeling like I don't do enough I'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not if it's imposter syndrome if it's from old Christian mantras of put others before yourself being baked into my psyche since childhood or if it's a combination of all three but I often feel like I don't do enough for other people in my life. Whether it's with other family members close friends or coworkers I often get this sense. I work from home. And I've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. But now that we're sitting near the finish line almost ready to golive with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover I can't help but feel some kind of guilt like I'm not doing enough. Even though I helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. With friends or family it often comes in the form of should I be there? or I know I be there be present but I really don't want to and then I just feel like a POS terrible friendsiblingsonetc. for not doing it. For example a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. Naturally I didn't go. I'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. Nonetheless I still felt like an asshole for skipping. Especially later when I talked to my dad and asked how it went I asked who was there? and he said Just about everyone. Except for you. I don't think he intended to make me feel guilty but it kind of did. My mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it but nonetheless I felt like I didn't do enough. Even though again this relative having the child and I don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. Another example is a friend a close friend who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. They'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants and 9 times out of 10 I don't go. Part of me appreciates the hell out of that because I need it and it's nice to be includedwanted. Another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone because I don't think I'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. Then I start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. Wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder or if it's something else.

50653,Devastated after finding out my little sister has a secret boyfriend Not sure if this belongs here but I'm so upset about this that I haven't slept all night. My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts interests and even my mental health struggles. I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything. Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities. I knew this day would come my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone abandoned and betrayed. She never mentioned that guy to me and my father I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything. Of course I want her to be happy but now all I'm left to do is wait for her to get married move to a different country and forget about me leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone.,Personality-disorder

Rent is coming out and there is ONLY enough in there for the payment. Unfortunately you have gone through the remainder of the borrowed money from the loans I took out. And you didnt get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late. You will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account.Im backed so far into a corner. I am just defeated. I have no food left I have no money and I cant bear the judgement. It feels like Ive already lost everything now theyve even taken my food? I cant do anything about it in this mental state. They dont even know Ive already failed out of my semester and cant leave my apartment. And my parents are insane. Legitimately delusional and abusive human beings. I mean Im crazy but these folks? Who starves their mentally ill son because theres not enough money and then flies to Vegas for the weekend for a vacation? I hate myself but even I dont deserve this. The isolation judgement and control I live under is unimaginable. Theres nothing metaphorical about it it is torture.Edit Im doing alright got some help from a friend for this week. Looking into my options.,Personality-disorder

51267,cant stand people with the same interests anybody else? i find i get very jealous when others share my same interests yea. i know it sounds like im an asshole. this feeling has been stuck with me since i was little. like when someone mentions they have the same interest i immediately feel worthless. its like wow okay. who needs me? nobody. i dont stand a chance. or someone posts about it and a bunch of other people are also into it. i feel so bland and competitive and ready to give up. they know more than me theyre better than me im not cool or special they will succeed and i wont. the other day i saw a post which mentioned my future career idea which was somewhat uncommon. 20k likes. i felt like giving up because i just feel so small and useless now? i dont know how to describe it really. i know this probably sounds like im looking too far into it..edit thank u for the comments. glad to know im not alone in this feeling and thank u for the advice some of u gave. ,Personality-disorder
50818,Emotions are determined by the reactions of others I've lost myself to the point where I feel like there's no meaning to being a part of society. Throughout history human beings have been motivated by goals and aspirations but I feel like I can no longer endure this way of living. The loss of my sense of self has left me feeling adrift and without any direction or purpose.,Personality-disorder
51330,Disillusioned by therapy Maybe I'm being too critical but I feel like therapy has not been helpful to me. I had finally reached out for help just before the pandemic and was seeing a therapist. She was extremely nice and it did help finally having someone to talk to. When everything switched to remote sessions during the pandemic it seemed like she rushed through our sessions and sometimes they would be over in 15 minutes. I didn't confront her about this. I ended up just ghosting. I'm not happy with myself for doing that but it's part of this illness I guess. I then went through my local university because I had read they had a good social anxiety program and saw a few a student therapists again all very nice people but I still felt stuck. About a year after seeing a few student therapists I was informed my current student therapist was finishing their program and that I would need to find a new therapist outside of their program. They offered to show me how to find one on Psychology Today. I was already well aware of how to do this and was a bit surprised with how it seemed like they were just dumping me off.I'm 31 years old. It took me decades to finally ask for help. I'm not blaming anyone and I need to put in the work to succeed but I have to say I was a bit disillusioned by the whole therapy experience. Just being honest.,Personality-disorder
50995,Update to 'Oh god I have a date' My old posthttpswww.reddit.comrAvPDcommentszwc806ohgodihaveadateHi everyone!Since you all were so kind I wanted to share my experience. The date went okay but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards shorter answers not really engaging in text chats. It felt like she had no interest so I stopped texting her. Last Wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. I chatted with her and some other people. It was quite nice. Afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking. She talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it therapy and so on. She was quite open and frank. Later when I was at home I thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. My picture of her had changed a bit. Previously I would have said she was quite the confident woman I still think she is though but afterwards I saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities. So I today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee. She texted me back that she thinks I'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me but her life is too full right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. She'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. She is sorry that's probably not the answer I was hoping for but she is just trying to being honest. I wrote back that it wasn't the answer I hoped for but I thought I would get. I thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome so I had to write her. So that's it. I'm a bit sad now although I knew this would be coming. Still it's better to be in the clear. I've given up some hope to find a partner. It's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated live through the frustration and get out of it on top. My few relationships began during those very rare moments in my life where I was truly happy. A condition that feels unreachable at the moment. This makes it feel impossible to find love. I try to be the best person I can be but it never feels enough.,Personality-disorder
50721,Why am I such a loser I take online classes and only leave my house for therapy or medical appointments. I am usually too afraid to talk to people online even in anonymous online spaces. I've always been a loner but for about a year it's been worse than ever. Literally zero friends. The severe isolation has caused me to forget how to socialize and behave around other people. I get so awkward and nervous and don't know how to carry on normal conversations. Even the dialogue in my writing is unnatural and weird. I see people online and even in this sub who aren't total loners and have friends or even partners. How? Why is everything so hard for me? Why can't I just be normal and function like everyone else?,Personality-disorder
51273,My first day at the job It was awful I hated it and I am so afraid of going in there again.. I don't want to go much into details but the whole day I kept forgetting every fucking thing I was told. I kept zoning out asking a lot of questions a lot of times the same kind of questions again and again being slow because how much I was overwhelmed. I kept telling myself that I am giving it my best it's my first day and no one should expect me being immediately perfect in this but it didn't really help. I needed to do a lot of multitasking to keep my eye on multiple things but it seemed that I just couldn't focus. In the end I felt extremely inferior to all my coworkers. Whenever some of them would remind me that I was forgetting somethingdoing something wrongetc I felt so attacked crushed judged...At some point I even nearly cried but I could suppress it. God I hate this shit. I am aware that 99 of those thoughts I have are completely inadequate and irrational I am certain that they were just trying to help and guide me since I am new in there. But why doesn't it help with feeling less worthless..,Personality-disorder
51197,Felt Not Good Enough I was going to go to a meet up group that eats different food around the city and then I canceled. I was so excited and hopeful about making friends but then I realized how since I got divorced I look so much older and so much chubbier.... I felt I would be able to sense by their reaction to me that I am not good enough and I don't belong. So I canceled. I feel sad about it. Also I never have money and I had a little extra cash so this is one of the few times I was going to be able to afford this group. I just don't have anyone to talk to about this and I feel sad and silly.,Personality-disorder
50681,did a bunch of dxm yesterday and I realized that the reason I'm like this is that I've viewed other people as threats my whole life. Ever since I was little I've implicitly assumed that other people want to hurt me until and unless I have incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. I have no idea why I'm like this. It sounds like something someone who was abused would write but I wasn't. My parents were nice and caring. I just came out wrong somehow lmao. I had nothing to be afraid of and yet I was terrified of everything ,Personality-disorder
50915,Imagine having avpd in like 1960 Theres not much to be thankful for regarding avpd but if Im going to have avpd Im at least glad I have it in the modern day. Imagine how hard it wouldve been in the past nobody would understand you wouldnt be able to get a proper diagnosis or explanation for your mental health issues and youd be totally isolated seeing as there would be no technology and none of the escapism it provides. Id be bored as fuck if I didnt have video games and drugs I ordered online to cope with this shit. You probably wouldve been ostracised from your community and branded a freak maybe even lobotomised or some shit if ur really unlucky. Im so thankful I have tech and modern day understanding i would be so fucked without it,Personality-disorder

50530,Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. Even then the relationships I do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.,Personality-disorder
51425,I'm screwed maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.The average person is socially active whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.I'm incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career life experiences life skills energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,Personality-disorder

51001,I know this probably isn't AVPD but sometimes I suspect I have a bit of it due to symptoms but that doesn't mean anything School sucks. All I do is hide the bathroom every break time to avoid social interactions because I also know there isn't anywhere to go or sit. If there is a place in the library I hope that nobody sits next to me or looks at me. I think people stare at me but when I look up they're not. I wish school days went faster and feel like I get anxiety attacks.I avoid making friends at school because I feel inferior to people. Like I don't deserve them and they're much better having someone else as a friend than me because I have 0 social skills and stress to maintain friendships. I try to seem mildly interesting by having hobbies but i know it isn't enough. I sometimes feel severely lonely and depressed at school and at home but try to distract myself from that. I don't speak a word at school. Somedays I dissociate and everything feels like this isn't my home or I'm dreaming.I think this is just general social anxiety but do any of you relate? BTW I'm not trying to self diagnose. I just need some help...,Personality-disorder
50503,Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives listening indirectly to their conversations while in public being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost in a way that no one could see me nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.Some of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life just some sort of play or movie.These days I been having the classic I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog idea and daydreams and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature never having to deal with socialization again only brief interactions for let's say buy necessary stuff from other people which I don't mind. I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.I guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection where I could be myself openly and comfortably but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry.

50840,I saw someone I barely know sneakily taking a pic of me while in auditorium I'm currently in uni not doing well and today I decided to show up to a lecture a girl from my dorm who takes the same classes as me sat in front of me. I saw her subtly taking a pic where I was in the background and circle my face out on it to put the attention on me in Snapchat. I have been avoiding all dorm activities and I know everyone else have become a tight group of friends while I have been too scared to go out there and get out of my dorm room to interact with anyone for the entire semester. When I think about it it makes perfect sense that people find me weird and make fun of me. It's being the odd one out the asocial guy who doesn't show his face. I mean I don't even know the names of the people in my hallway. I can understand why they would talk about my strangness or see me as weird even be kind of disgusted by me. I am extremely akward I lack social skills I am anxious and get panic attacks emotional flashbacks when around people. I have no healthy boundaries and do not know who I am as a person have no consistent sense of self. To cope with all this I avoid all situations in which people could reject me or shame me for my insecurities lack of social skills etc. By avoiding situations I am trying to avoid getting rejected or ridiculed and deep down I know it's only normal to be frowned upon for being different or weird think about the fact that you can't help but look at someone who walks weird because of arthritis or when you come accros a homeless man lying on the side of the street. Your attention either gets caught or you try to consciously ignore it.Somehow I was still somewhat believing that I could fool the people in my dorm and hope they won't think of me as flawed insecure weird antisocial a loner etc. After seeing that I am indeed most likely a subject of ridicule mockery disgust etc to the people in my dorm I can fully drop my delusion.I have CPTSD and I developped my avoidance because of childhood emotional neglectabandonment and abuse by my narc mother. My brain is wired differently than the average person with healthy and good enough parents. I didn't have secure attachments in childhood and I am for that reason developmentally arrested. The people in my dorm don't know me and don't know about my trauma or CPTSD. They are doing what humans do pointing out the weirdness the odd one out the undesirable. It triggers people when they are confronted by something they don't understand or find weird it's normal they have their own insecurities and issues and can project all of that on the black sheep on the odd one out. If I had healthy parents good enough social skills and a fully developped and trauma free brain I would probably do the same when I encountered a weird person heck I even have judged many people for being strange undesirable or weird myself and thought I was superior to them.,Personality-disorder

And then suddenly her very friendly behavior changed to mad behavior and she started avoiding me.This is one of the things I am really good at other than that I am bad pretty much at anything.,Personality-disorder

50998,Might i have avpd? Alright before i start i want to say that im 16. Ive been showing some symptoms as long as i can remember but i hate self diagnosis so i want some help. Because i dont want to have a pdobviously Ive been extremely shy and untrusting of others ever since i was a small child. Im often rude and cold to people bc im extremely afraid of someone talking to me and try to make them think im not talking to them bc im arrogant and not a loser whos afraid of everyone. But im more like the second. Ive always been insecure also i had a history of self harm. But i did that because i feel like im not enough and dont deserve to even breath the same air as most people not because im suicidal. I had suicidal thoughts a lot but i never considered doing it because im too much of a coward for it. I also project my insecurities on people a lot and try to find someone inferior to me to communicate. Ive felt inferior for so long that i want to be superior to someone so i project my insecurities and drag them down. Im not jelaous by any means i just want someone inferior to me. I dont think i even need to mention i have no friends and push anyone that tries to talk to me bc i suspect theyre bullying me. But i have good relations with my family even though they also make me a little anxious. And i have a diagnosis of gad,Personality-disorder

50584,AvPD diagnosed recently Hey all I was diagnosed with AvPD quite recently and finally I guess after all those years spent in confusion what is wrong with me. I finally got an appointment at psychologist we were doing for the first few hours screening process turned out I do have AvPD and I met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with BPD. Also he mentioned that I do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. But after I read his diagnosis this evening he wrote that I have Other personality disorder. Which idk how I feel about that. Like I do not belong to anything even in this. And when I started to talk to him about feeling really depressed and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today he just said that we will talk about it next time in a two weeks. And I am so confused about this like no one really care especially with the suicidal thoughts. And feeling I do have no one to talk. Or maybe I dont want to? I dont know. But this is making me super super lonely and more depressed. No one really cares..,Personality-disorder

51556,Quality over quantity Friendships I know people with AvPD struggle to maintain friendships and I do too. For me I think it's the daily or at least frequent messaging to stay in touch that I struggle with. I will get tired and ignore messages just because I don't have the capacity to engage with a subject that I frankly probably don't care much about or I'm just worn out by the constant interaction. The messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me. if it's a friend that lived far away then I'd rather not speak for 6 months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and fortunately I do have a couple that are like that. Anyone relate?,Personality-disorder
50798,It's easy to say that everyone has worth. If I say that I am a worthless subhuman most people will react by saying something like everyone has intrinsic value and that you don't need society or other people to validate your existence. And while it may be theoretically true it's also easy and generic.What is difficult is to feel that you actually have value when such a big part of your life has passed without anyone seeing that value in you. I'm not a bad person but frankly I'm barely a person. I'm unable to do the majority of things most people do. I lack any semblance of personality. People forget about me and that's totally reasonable. Everyone likes me but not really. No one cares about me or is really interested in me.I have acquired major schizoid traits throughout the years to the point that sometimes I'm not sure if I need human connection anymore. But I find myself craving external validation. If there's no one there to believe that you matter do you really? The obvious answer is yes but I'm not so sure anymore.,Personality-disorder
50570,All I am is a useless burden I volunteer at a place that I like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because I like helping people plus Itll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days I didnt show up due to sickness. Now im supposed to text them when I dont show up my manager? boss? made that very clear. She even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that I absolutely couldnt take phone calls due to anxiety. Now I may or may not have just skipped that part as Id hate to bother them with a text plus its embarrassing. So basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that I cant keep not notifying them when I cant go and I have one last chance or shed rather have me not help out at all. This of course I soooo badly wanna say traumatized because it feels that way but ive experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasnt actually traumatic really hurt me. All I wanted to do was help. I just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all I did was end up being a burden. I hate myself for this im scared to even go in again. If I cant even hold a volenteer position im sure as hell arent ever going to be able to get a real job when I get older. I fucking hate this disease its taking my life away.,Personality-disorder

She suggested we meet up and considering how much I've progressed recently I figured I wouldn't give myself enough time to reconsiderdoubt myself and just said yes.I was pretty chill for the most part but my nerves got the best of me once there were only two hours left before the date but it still wasn't nearly as bad as it would've been before.The date went pretty well. I was pretty nervous but nothing that was overwhelming. We walked and talked a bunch went to a small art exhibition grabbed some ice cream and then I had to leave.Overall a very pleasant experience despite the nervousness. I would have neeever in my life had thought that I'd be able to go on a tinder date fully sober. In the past I had to get blackout drunk other drugs to even text people on Tinder so I'm very very very glad I had the power in me to not cancel or chicken out and actually go through with this even if nothing might come of it. I'll definitely have more confidence moving forward thanks to this experience.Good luck out there!,Personality-disorder
50939,Being avoidant and the pandemic I dont know what it was about the pandemic that hit me but it hit me hard and I still find myself stuck in so many ways. I was never so scared in my life.I became agoraphobic and couldnt leave my house. I became obsessed with the news and the statistics. For someone who has been suicidal practically my whole life I was truly afraid of dying.Did anyone else find yourself getting worse through this and what did you do to get past it? When I go to doctors appts they still make us wear masks and that scares me a bit still. Like what do they know that we dont?Im sure Im overthinking things like I do with everything else. My daughter is anti vaxx and it worries me too Ive had them all as a precaution since my health isnt the best now.

I struggle to maintain friendships because I always push them away out of fear they will see the real me and I think Im an empty person with no personality. I never developed my own personality. I always mirrored people to fit in.I have an intake tomorrow for a rehab clinic. Im addicted to Xanax. I think the addiction is just a result of my mental problems that are really complicated and go far back into the past. After the rehab I will go to Portugal for an intense treatment for 2 months all by my own. No phones allowed. I think itll do me really good and Im glad I have this opportunity. I know they arent going to fix my problems and I need to do it myself but it is a big step for me to travel alone. To really work on myself. Its a step forward.

51482,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling...

I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising I can't seem to use social media well too afraid that my relatives will find it andor hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange? I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long I want to express myself and find a space for my art craft and ideas that accepts me for me.And I'm sure in order to be independent I need to also be comfortable with myself.But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down.

50695,What I see on Instagram IS real and it's killing me inside A selfpitying post for your viewing pleasure Stop self harming by stalking people yada yada yada I know!!!! I know I know better!BUT.I'm sick of being told they only show the happy moments. No shit. But they have happy moments. They have adventures with friends that they post every other week or even just every month and some of them even post every week or more. I'm in my early 20s and so many people I went to high school with are traveling the world before they're tied down with more responsibilities and their bodies fall apart mine already is.... Not because they're rich but because they're simply financially comfortable and have connections with people social skills. And because they're not afraid to take risks. And because they've built a life for themselves an identity since early on in high school maybe even earlier which makes doing all of this feel normal to them makes it all so much easier for them.And if they're not traveling they're still going on smaller adventures with friends and gfsbfs. Or they're performing in a band at local venues and they're actually good now. Or they're about to graduate college. Envy kills me.I'm so fucked up I took a gap year to figure out what I want to do with my life only to drop out of an overpriced community college this year because I still feel too directionless.And I know I could have at least a small chance at what these people have if only I would get off my ass instead of sulking. I actually just checked more like stalked because I'm not following any of these people Instagram for the first time in months. Hurt even more than it did the last time. And in those months where I stopped looking at their lives did mine improve? Did pretending they aren't living happy fulfilling lives by avoiding their social media posts altogether make my life any better? Contrary to what every mentalhealthgurugenius on Reddit claims no it didn't make my life any better. I'm still stuck. I try my hardest every day and I'm still stuck.Sure. I've finally had a job at this point in my life retail but I snapped and quit. I can drive now though I hate it. I can go by the mall by myself and do some shopping not that I have money to spend. And yet it's nothing. It means nothing because it's not enough. Not enough for society and not enough to make me feel fulfilled because it means nothing without other people.,Personality-disorder
50715,Do therapists even understand AVPD? I generally like my therapist. I think he's the best one I've found so far. But today's session just proved that he doesn't understand. And I admit that my inability to open up is a barrier to make much progress. But I heard the same generic advice....go out. Meet people. Do something fun. And that's not BAD advice. Probably should do that. But the problem is every time I go out I feel anxious selfconscious and ashamed. I don't even think I have social anxiety. Shy but not on that level. I can handle BRIEF infrequent surface level conversations. Anything more than that is a nogo. So I seem more outgoing than I am. And it's like he focuses on my lack of relationships so that's what I bring up. I think it's because he's a solutionfocused therapist and he doesn't seem too concerned about the pastunderstanding one's self. Just do it pretty much. CBT. Opposite of feeling action. Which is all true. But honestly I isolate because I'm depressed. Which is why I don't maintain relationships or want to put myself out there. So I don't know what to do. I don't know what my problem is. I'm just over it. Older seasoned avpders if that's a thing any advice for me? Should I stick therapy out or just forget it?

50605,I recovered from AvPD. What will help others? I dont believe in matters of mental health ever truly being 100 cured.Even though I still have some AvPD traits that Im still working on my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.Ive gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.All through school people called me socially retarded and my mom thought I was autistic.To now being a very socially skilled confident outgoing person who makes friends easily.Im curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how Ive recovered from my AvPD what helped me how long it can take etc?I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible and spreading that false message. It is possible! Its just really hard uncomfortable takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? Im also open to suggestions of what else could help.P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry skeptical reaction or think Im being narcissistic.

Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me an email to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure tall douchey rich guy in contrast to me 5'8 not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career. Anyway these pieces of information that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.,Stress

HiIm a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home I found the job to be manageable albeit stressful for the first 89 months.However after a year I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout feeling completely drained unmotivated and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less the results are still expected.I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand the benefits of international experience such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives are invaluable. On the other hand the stress is taking its toll and I'm not sure if it's worth it.I would appreciate any advice from those who have been in similar situations or know someone who has.

The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. My stress levels are currently through the roof about this as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers who even though treated as adults at University still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is even though not permanent the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an old person is living with basically a teenager although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom so maybe not so bad. Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this but already having experienced this with not much success I am now stressing immensely.

Checking my records of doctor visits I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life.

I went to see a counselor in college and he thought if I got more of a routine going I would be fine he also was extremely judgemental and scolded me for not coming into college regularly he didn't believe me things I told him so I left. I did go to a counselor about 12 times after the abusive relationship ended I still felt vulnerable and scared leaving it that place and told her I don't feel ready to stop this.

I have a job that I hate its my first job its a 95 in a high pace high stress environment and when I make a mistake it has an effect and of course I do make mistakes. My coworker also treats me like a personal assistant and delegates all of her last minute jobs to do immediately without thanks which is so stressful as I can never complete a project on time because of it. Enough backstory though this isnt a life advice sub I just need to rant about the things I think are caused by stress?Ive always looked young for my age I take good care of my skin using retinol and SPF 50 every day yet my skin is ageing I turned 20 a month ago so this is weird. I look heavier than I am I get a lot of exercise 10K steps minimum daily plus cardio focussed gym 25 times a week depending how tired i am and do not over eat if anything tw I probably under eat by a long way because I lose my appetite and forget to eat. Its just bizarre to me and its not that I want to be thinner but I know that with my lifestyle I ought to be a lot thinner than I am so Ive no clue what the reasoning for that is. My psoriasis is getting worse. It used to be a small patch on my leg but now Ive got it on my lips cheeks back and its spreading down my arm. I was researching self soothing and I do that obsessively I bite my lips to oblivion and crack my knuckles to the point where they hurt. I am ALWAYS tired even if I get 14 hours of sleep luckily my insomnia has gone away for the time being but that used to be really bad too. I also get migraines the second I begin to relax. If its not pretty obvious ill just throw in that I have been diagnosed with anxiety. My doctor doesnt want to help and theres no free therapy in my area as theres massive wait lists for everything. So Im on here hoping to find someone who might relate. Can this all be due to stress? Do you have any advice?

I'm a 22 female and my job is reporting and introducing new stores and foods on TV. It's creative and fun but because of the unstable income my mother doesn't support me.I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there. I don't let that get in the way with work though.Anyway. Today this random stranger during my break time came up to me and looked directly into my eyes and said You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.She kept holding my shoulders and gently rubbing them and I have no clue if this is hypnosis I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good peopleAnd little by little the weight in my shoulders started to get lighter. And it felt fuzzy. I had this feeling why does she know my family? Can she read me? Am I readable? Is my aura out? I'm about to panic! Then I just burst into tears and had to control myself to do the next reporting.It was such a confusing experience because she was smiley nice in her 50s lady. Can someone tell me if she was a hypnotist or if she can see my soul or some angels or if she was just an empath that knew I was extremely stressed and wanted to let me know I was stressed. Because later She was motioning to her friend her shoulders like letting her know my shoulders were super tight or scrunched up.I don't know... It was such a coincidence. And a strange encounter that I had to write about this experience as my first post.,Stress
48362,I can't stop thinking and I need to vent!! Hi Reddit I'm here to vent about my stress and honestly I have no one to talk to. I am F 23 and last year I started my first big girl job as a copywriter in marketing. I originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer anything to get me to be on set. My love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. I enjoy talking to the cast getting behind the camera and being transported to a different unique world. So why was my first big job in marketing? During the pandemic my concern was how to get myself out there when I was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing and I took it honestly anything to make my portfolio and resume look good. Not going to lie the internship was fun and exciting so when they offered me an entrylevel position in marketing I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now having been here for a year I've built up an extreme amount of stress.Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed anxious and depressed. I'm always messing up and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. I am struggling with my grammar not being strong enough when it comes to presenting and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result I received a PIP and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat don't feel like getting out of bed can't breathe can't sleep and can't think clearly.Additionally I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months yes you read that right. My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.The whole experience is making me feel like a failure like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school debt help my parents pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet and help my grandma in Mexico and more bills?My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. They say I should still be proud because I tried something new created a new set of skills and toughened up. I don't know if that's true.,Stress

Things were not perfect and there was still a lot of things that needed to change in order for me to progress.,Stress

48639,I got extremely stressed in workplace and home. To speak I live in South East Asia where work is long hours and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.I have been managing my stress with family issues too so everything is a bit of a mishmash as I am angrily typing this down. And autism doesn't help with my stress management either.I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 34 months with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 45 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring selling board gamesblind boxes and even large figurine tradings throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 1112 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.Then a few days ago when I got home from work around 11pm almost midnight my dad called me in to have a talk with him then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.Sorry it's more of a rant post but I do need help managing my own stress and it just came up almost everyday. How do I do it?

I'm already struggling mentally which is why my friends so adamant on getting me out of my situation. So im absolutely going insane right now. I can't breathe. Can barely think. I start to think about getting the rental and I feel like I want to collapse.,Stress

I don't even know I'm sorry I wish I had something concrete to say but I don't think I could even type it out. The problem is I've recently moved to Japan on my own and have no one to talk to here.

I eat maybe a few bites of food most days rarely eating a proper meal. I'm not even doing my usual stress binge eating nor are my chocolate cravings there. I just feel full or sick every time I try eat. I'm losing weight rapidly that I can't afford to lose I'm very short and already had a small frame so even just 3kg is a huge loss for me anymore and I'll look like a ghostMost of my stressors will leave me when the move itself happens and I'm seeing a new therapist as well then one better equipped to help me.I just need help with eating in the meantime. I can barely stomach anything when I do try eat a meal I'm done after a few bites. I have very little control at the moment and I want to do right to my body to reduce the impact of this stress. All I can really control are food making sure I take my medication and get some extra sleep. I just need help or advice with the food part. Again it's just until I move and I have a support network and control over my life again.,Stress

48831,How do I get better? I am 18 from Brazil currently doing architecture. I have depression and anxiety probably ADHD too but still need to do the tests again. I was taking medication since mamy years ago. Got discharged at the begging of the year before starting college had to get back at it again after starting the course. I took the same meds as before which I used for years but my body didn't understand that I have already took then before and had some side effects that scared me and I stopped taking one of the meds. Then after the end of my 1st semester I was looking worse with my depression so my psychiatrist decided to give me adult depression meds... safe to say it backfire extraordinarily I just turned 18 barely a month ago. Went to other doctors and and the 1st side effect went away but the adult medication gave me more and worse side effects so again me psychiatrist suggested changing meds. My mom already had some bad impressions on the doctor so after they tried to change again with no wait to see if I'd get better she told me to stop taking any meds altogether.I get why my appetite is lower than usual and I am super sensible to climate and temperature my intestines are hurting and my head aches everyday. So I am currently on the process of adapting. And a new college period stared when I was told to change meds for the 2nd time... I am barely keeping up again with whats being teached and although I got the handle of how college works I am suffering. Stuff that usually don't bother me or gove me so much work are really demanding me. I am not taking notes as I'd like or being able to concentrate in almost any task that is mildly difficult. Am currently procrastinating the 36 pages and topics that range from a to z of architecture topics that I have to summarise and another 17 pages that I also will summarise all for today untill 1159 PM currently the hour is 1907...,Stress

48833,Does anyone else get stressed out over School even though theyve been doing it their whole lives? I start my first year of college and Im super stressed out and even though Ive been taking College classes through my high school Im still stressed out about it. Ive been stressed about school my whole life despite having all As and being in the top 10 of my grade. I really dont understand how people can just have a calm attitude when it comes to things like school and work because the mere thought of either stresses me out. Now usually after the first month Im completely fine because Ive gotten used to the class the teacher and the work but the first couple weeks are so stressful for me. I have a mad fear of being alone and failure and I like things to always stay the same in my life so I guess all of that contributes to my problems with stressful situations. I have no friends going to the same college as me and Ive always liked having at least one person I knew to make me more comfortable quicker but having work thrown in front of me and having to one to talk to if I need help is terrifying to me.

48693,Restricting stressors on devices. help! Hi all I thought this would be a good place to ask.Sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress. I have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past even if they would hurt me and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.Right now I've been using an app called 'Freedom' which has been very useful. The issue? I've figured out how to disable it whenever I want. Knowing that at any point I could breach the restrictions I put in place just makes me super anxious. I'm able to go into the VPN settings and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.Does anyone know any surefire way I can block things and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social media for 24 hours is often the best way I can get back on track with my day and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me. Is self discipline my only option or is there a better way?,Stress

Ended up losing contact with everyone but the one friend I could talk to maybe once or twice a week for a couple hours. She'd try to keep me apprised of stuff going on with folks and those phonecalls ended up bring the spark that bloomed into us being a couple but... It wasn't enough.

48846,Anyone else lose the ability to have emotions and feelings as physical sensations in the body? All sensations of feeling and emotion is gone from my body. I dont Feel numb i Feel dead.My brain also feels nonresponsive and i am only on autopilot.My body feels like stone. Too light. Nothing dragging it down causing a heavy feeling making it be my own. My arms feels so strange. It feels like I am not in my body. It is so mechanical. I dont sleep because i dont Feel sleepy. I never Feel calm in my body just an unnerving neutral and restless feeling.I want to Feel but there is nothing in my body. When i am sad and angry i just know because there is nothing in my body. No surge of rage and no pain in my chest. When i lay down under my covers i dont get a familiar calm and warm heavy feeling in my body. It is still hard as stone on the inside.Also i dont Feel hunger. And never sleepy in my head. I also dont Feel confused in my head or get a foggy feeling. Even though i know that is what i am. I also never get a feeling associated with a place or memory. When i think of a memory i get no spontanious emotion connected to it. Like sitting on the terrace with a nice cup of tee early morning walks sitting down on the couch after a hard day of work. Never get these feelings in my body. Also the feelifn of autimn friday christmas. All gone. Cant even remember them in my mind because i cant Feel with my brain. All emotions are purely mental. Sometimes my brain is so numb though it does not respond to any stimulus. And i have this constant unsatisfactory feeling because nothing makes me Feel.All i have left is stress in my body. Nothing else. This bad restlessness i cant get out of.It feels like so bad!Anyone else experience this and get emotions back in the body?,Stress

11678,Basically I am stuck.To give you the rundown my home situation is bad. I am 13 hopefully that does not make people belittle me I just want to be as clear as possible. My mother is single parents divorced when I was born and she treats me like actual shit. I have had to be my own caretaker for a long time she is never really been there for me emotionally and sometimes even physically.I have wanted to off myself for awhile actually. I guess I am just worried about the after part. And it is not like I want to feel pain on my way out.Maybe I just do not want a surefire way of ending it because I wanted someone close to me to just.. realize how miserable I am. I kind of want to do it just as a jab at my mother. This is your fault. that is what she would think. Or rather it is what I would want her to think.It baffles me that I have been able to fly under the radar so long. it is probably selfish to think this way but I have been living like this for so long and if things do not change I will have to take initiative.Only one person actually cares and he is someone I know that is online. he is kept me clinging on but I feel bad relying on him all the time. My mother has done nothing to help. I have seen three therapists and she just uses that as ammo against me. My father knows but at my request he did not do anything I am terrified of being institutionalized and I know that is what my mother would immediately do. I do not think he knows quite what to do himself.I have ruined myself. I am not sure what to do. With the approach of school I think about doing it more. But I still have not even devised a plan or anything. I do not know what to do. I feel like the longer I sit in this rut the better of an idea it seems. Despite the fact that I know it is probably just pointless and stupid. I am kind of on the fence about it.,Suicidal

I have asked him so many things and do not end up getting most of the things and its okay its how life is. I have prayed I worked my soul off I sacrificed myself all to be with the person I loved the most in the world. And I did I did end up with her but only to get left off within few years. I figure god would have thought hmmmm you do not deserve to be normal gave me what I desired the most and took her away in 4 years.If anyone is reading this Imsorry I am sorry for wasting your time I am a dissapointment and from the bottom of my heart I am sorry.

9712,Firstly I just know that I will not ever be able to transition to how I want to be. I will not be able to get top surgery or hormones or whatever because that shit is too expensive and I can barely make enough money to pay rent as it is.I do not have insurance I am struggling to make money and I barely have any skills that I am proud of. I am walked all over by everyone I know because I am a people pleaser. I just want to snap at everyone one day. I want to isolate myself from everyone I know. I just want to stop existing in the eyes of everyone I know.I try to ground myself do that stupid coping skill shit but it just does not work. Medication does not work for me either I have tried. Therapy maybe worked for a little bit but I never really got to the things that I really needed to get through in the 3 years I went. Maybe I should become an alcoholic as soon as I can legally buy alcohol. It runs in the family after all. I do not see any point in trying so Ill just throw everything away as soon as I possibly can. I do not even know how the fuck I have gotten as far as I have in life. And I am barely scraping by. I often have fantasies of the train tracks near my house. Its only a 1015 minute walk to get there. I think about putting my head onto the tracks listening to music and closing my eyes. The only reason I have not done it yet is because I am scared.The only reason is instinctual self preservation. And I hate it. I do not have the balls to just up and leave in the middle of the night because I feel like my roommate would figure it out. Or maybe not idfk. Maybe if I just pretend everything is fine for a little longer I can leave without a trace and no one will notice until its too late. Hopefully it would be successful so that I would not have to deal with hospital fees. Tbh I do not think there is any coming back from a train crushing your head in anyways. No one would notice if I disappeared one day. I am going to go nowhere in my life. I will not transition I will not be successful I will not have anything good going for me.,Suicidal
17807,hi I am not sure if this is the right place to post this but I need advice. my sister she is 28f and were twins has been practically doom scrolling when covid began. she is been reading all of these theories and stories about the world and hollywood and the catholic church being corrupted and granted she might be right about these things but none of us know what to do anymore. her boyfriend is reaching out to my mom and I to figure out how we can help but I am walking downtown right now she was last seen here trying to find her but she will not pick up any of our phone calls. and this is not the first time I have had to do this recently. she does not want to be helped and says she is okay after doing this before but then does it again. I am worried if I take her to therapy she will get stuck w someone who is procovid ? and trigger her in all sorts of wrong ways when she just needs someone that will listen to her. we did for awhile but it was hard for us to hear about rape pedophiles animal cruelty and covid vaccines being the mark of the devil all the time too.. what should we do? please do not shame her for her beliefs she is hurt and has a big heart and just wants a better world. todr twin sister is suicidal about all the darkness in the world will not accept help suicide threats getting more consistent. suicidal sister,Suicidal
14696,So the other day I kind of had a breakdown when no one was home a severe one that I was not sure I would survive. This has not happened to me in years. But now today my situation got even worse and everything seems so hopeless that I cannot feel anymore. I need to cry but I cannot I want to be happy but I cannot. I even tried to masturbate the past couple of days but it is like my brain is devoid of all and any serotonin.So now I am kind of stuck in a drifting state where I am just completely tuning out my emotions until it is safe to feel them again. Honestly not sure if I am a sociopath because surely this is not normal. Usually I would try to feel sad anyway or make myself feel really down like I deserve it but that does not really help anything so I just choose nothing today. I do not want to fight feeling nothing today as much as I would rather have emotions but after my breakdown and what I almost did I do not feel like it is safe.Anyways I thought I was getting to a point where I was finally emotionally healthy but everything came crashing down within a couple of days. I just feel concerned for myself for the future because this numb thing only happens when I am at the very lowest of my depression and cannot take it anymore. I would not wish it on anyone. I feel like I am missing out on life because I cannot feel right now. I cannot do anything right now. Hoping maybe someone with the same problem can help when this wears off and I get to the scary part again. Thanks. Choosing nothing today,Suicidal

I have a home I have a car I have a family who cares for me. But I am completely lost in life. I am 23 and when I graduated high school in 2016 I had no idea what to do with my life. My dad who was my best friend and greatest ally died unexpectedly of a heart attack in October of 2016. I was not only lost I was devastated. Still am. My family still is. Anyways I never thought I had the determination or courage to go to college so I stayed at my restaurant job I had. I had been there for 6 years then in May this year I quit. No two weeks or anything. I was so tired of the same routine that happened there and the toxicity of the place so I left. I have never thought of myself with any high regard. I do not think I am pretty or smart or fun. I have always seen myself as a burden on anyone who comes near me. This has proven to be true time and time again. I had a 3 year relationship with a man I love deeply but he left me for someone else in November of 2020. He always told me I was crazy needed help he could not provide and so on. When that happened I was fully convinced that I ws better off dead. i knew i did not want to be alone with my intrusive thoughts. but i kept on. kept working. kept trying. i met a few other men after that all who further proved the fact that i am not worthy of love. All left me. I am now unemployed with rent due at the end of the month. i have a roommate who is counting on me. i tried to make it work at another job but it became clear after my first week that i was not in a healthy enough mental space to work there. all the friends i have are too busy with their significant others to lend me some help.i feel no hope for myself. this feels like the universe telling me that i am not needed here. i want to live. i want to feel the happiness that i know might be possible for me. but i have no clue how to get there. it feels like i have no guidance. my motivation is constantly outweighed by my doubts and anxiety. i just want to have a place in the world. any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated and it just might save my life. I have no money no guidance and no idea. If you read this I love you and thank you. Please reach out. Julia Every day feels hopeless,Suicidal
21746,going to keep this short since I am writing it on break. I recently got a new job last week and on my second day my girlfriend who I absolutely loved more than anything broke up with me. Today I get called into my work office and get reemed for poor performance and that I should be working a lot quicker than my current pace despite being here a fucking week.I want to just go home and off myself. I am 19 and already feel like I am not going to get anywhere. I was left shattered and now I am suffering at work and I cannot see an end to this. If anyone here can give me some sort of encouragement to keep trucking I really need it. Thanks Reddit. Where do I go and what do I do,Suicidal
25188,as my previous post said I am 15 and the rest is pretty much explained from there I am not even sad right now but i honestly just do not want to be here so I am drinking in hopes it will help numb the pain of liver failure which is ironic anyway I am writing this to say goodbye I am not sure if I will even do it because honestly I am terrified but i do not want to be here so fuck it right? i have not said goodbye to any friends or family because if i do not do it I will feel like I am attention seeking so I have decided that I will just say goodbye to you lot because no matter what happens I will probably never meet any of you so it does not matter if i die or not because either way I will be waking up in hell tomorrow this is it,Suicidal
8120,Instead of getting better I get worse. I feel poisoned.I take the steps I see before me and it is like the ground changes with every step.I feel lost.Things I do should be making it better....even a grain of sand at a time and all of it turns to despair. I feel broken.I do not know how to make another step when I feel like all I will do is hurt everyone I see.I feel poisoned by all I am. I feel poisoned,Suicidal
16292,Everyone blames me for everything and treats me like the bad guy and talks down to me. This is why I think about shooting people and then killing myself. Violent suicidal thoughts,Suicidal
10045,This might actually be my chance It turns out I may have found out a way to finally do it this week quickly and almost painlessly and I am quite excited at the idea,Suicidal
13117,I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since is was 8 years old. To be honest its all because of my abusive parents. A few hours ago they were cursing my name hittingpunching me and spitting at me. They say that I am the reason of their misery and that they hate their lifes because of me. I am a 15 year old girl who tries her best in achieving everything they ask me to do. I hate my life because of my parents. Nothing is ever good enough and I think a lot about ending my life. I told my friend about my thoughts but she did not care. I wish somebody understood me and helped me through this without judging me. The worst thing is that I am always smiling and hiding my pain. I want to make people laugh and smile that is my only source of happiness. I wish someone could make me happy and genuinely smile without thinking about suicide. I hope I will attend that day. My only wish is to be free happy and never have to remember this pain. Suicidal thoughts on a daily base,Suicidal
21715,Last year a coworker jokingly asked me where do I see myself in the next five years. I was honest with him and told him I am not going to be alive by then.I am currently 27 did my first attempt when i was 21. And ever since while I have discovered things that temporarily distract me i do not look forward to anything really I am tired of pretending I have worked exploitative jobs to help around the house because my self esteem simply sabotages me from taking a big leap career wise. I know I will mess up in my first try. To be honest i regret choosing the career i have. Not once brought me joy. But i do not think anything else would have either way.I regret paying for braces. What for? I am going to end up dead anyway. Stupid painful expensive procedure. I feel even worse knowing my mother paid for it and I am going to waste it when I off myself. Same for school same for keeping my long hair same for trying not to drown in rum which does bring temporary peace when I am drunk.I have a very faint fantasy of finding my other half. But it is very faint because who in their right mind would even consider tolerating me by their own free will. I would like to marry wear a pretty dress I would like it red i think it will suit me. But again at this age with all this burden why do i even imagine that. I would like to do many things but I will be wasting somebody is else time. I feel like I am in still water. Just floating by. Waiting for an opportunity to end it all in another city. Maybe i lied that is probably the only thing I look forward to. Thank you for reading. I do not do long term plans,Suicidal
7352,i feel like I am losing my best friend she does not seem the same around me anymore and avoids affection which usually she is very affectionate so that rlly worries me lol idk hwat to do if i lose her i will have no future bc my future was supposed to b with her i want to kill myself help,Suicidal
21125,Just like i knew it would. Happiness only last so long it like love is temporary and conditional.I really do not think i have many more years ahead of me. If this year is not the one i know another will be. That itch is coming back,Suicidal
22421,I do not want to die i really do not but the last few years of my life have been very terrible. I have lots of people in mylife that love and care about me but i still feel empty and alone every day i wake up. I feel hopeless and lost. I feel afraid and trapped in my own mind. I have tried to end my life once before but i failed because i cannot even get that right. My mom and sister will probably never forgive me but i hope one day they will understand. Life will go on people will go in with their lives and society will keep moving forward because in the end no one truly cares about you. I wish a beautiful life full of joy and happiness to you all. I am sorry but i cannot live like this any longer. lt3 I am ending it tonight,Suicidal
16224,I cannot keep living like this there is no point to living anymore life is not going to get better so I am going to go and kill my self because whatever after death has to be better than this I am done,Suicidal
8302,I cannot do it anymore. I am overcome with grief shame guilt anger and sadness. Everyday for a very long time I have been sinking deeper and deeper into hopelessness and despair to the point where I cannot even control how I behave in public. I am such a fucking piece of shit. I want to die so bad. I cannot stand seeing people woth relatively healthy brains. My whole life has been so fucked up from childhood through adulthood. I am done. DONE. I have become such a sick fuck. I do not even know why I am posting this. I literally cannot go another day. I have been saying that everyday for some time now. Everything I used to love and believe in has died inside of me. I have already spiritually died. I need to physically die now. It just gets worse every fucking day,Suicidal
12187,I am a failure at everything to the point I cannot kill myself properly I hate myself so much I am not good enough I was never good enough the world as a whole would be better off without me I want to kill myself but I am to cowardly to do it.,Suicidal
13241,Why is everything so confusing Life is good at the moment but i still want to kms,Suicidal
14377,I woke up again today. At first I felt really nice but then I understand for what I am really devastated and I am really fcking sad. I just do not want to live anymore. I love this girl so much and I cannot accept my rejection because she want another guy. I need something to cheer me up not like a friend booze a doctor but someone to really say to me that she love me to give a hug to cry someone who really loves me for what I am I am devastated,Suicidal
8883,Fake it till you make it One thing I have heard so often growing up. So much so I have almost mastered it.I have realized however this is wrong. I am now unable to handle basic life shit. I cannot be real. I cannot be dedicated. I cannot be anything other than what others want and now cannot be what I need. I have lost those whom care. I am struggling to keep my job. Though doubt is more common than sense at this point. Idk why I have not been fired. Assume my personality is making an image of me that is false and fake. If you do not know me I am amazing it seems. Actually know me and I am the worst person to know. Anyone and everyone. I tried to self access my self even when every port into psychology has been closed for me so I am no expert but it seems its either my fault or my raising of understanding. I guess both can be my fault at the end of the day. Idk. My mother has issues for life meaning I have observed dealt with or noticed. Father absent. Black which has its own issues from society and within family. Problems everywhere. Uhg work will continue do not want to discard all I have written brb Seriously why?,Suicidal
15698,I am scared I was not doing well and took two medic and they were the extra like the one who are more effective and idk what to do I calmed down and do not really want to die anymore pls anyone I am scared Well I just took pills,Suicidal

21103,I think I am done with being alive. My life has been pretty rough since birth. No real need to dive into that. But now I am nearly 30. Nothing has gotten better. No friends dead end job cannot get over a relationship that ended 5 years ago not close to my family soon to be homeless bc I do not make enough to afford to live on my own. I really have tried to turn things around. I have hobbies but I just do not care about them anymore. I do not care about my job and I have 0 skills so there is no way I can find a better one. I have tried meds but I am always berated by doctors and people I look to for help bc they assume I only want drugs? Idk. Plus I am just broke and cannot afford that stuff. And I do not have insurance. I do not drive bc it is terrifying so that pretty much destroys any type of relationship I have gotten myself into. I am awkward as fuck. I have no personality. I am just done. I do not want to be alive. Every day fucking hurts I do not really know where else to say this kind of stuff,Suicidal
15499,Well life is a turbulent thing is not it. I do not even know why I am posting this.I am not going to get into the nitty gritty of my life because I know it will bore you to tears and right now I am feeling a bit lazy. Long story short got into my dream university found out even in a new city people are just as shitty and spiraled out of control. Stopped going to class and flunked everything.A year later I fought to get those grades of the record which I did then somehow the schools that gave me scholarships do not want anything to do with me. Found out that having a narccist parent basically messed up my brains development and explained a lot of things.I have had great grades at everything but math so I have been doing grade 12 functions. If it goes well I may get in and restart my academic career. If not well I gave life my all. So far it was going great in math til the trig test now my mark is in trouble and now also I am likely to flunk tomorrow too. I am just out of gas starting feel like I am running low on energy. I swore to myself I will give it my all maybe the lack of energy is my body is sending a message. I am not going to quit atleast not yet If this does not work out I have really got only choice,Suicidal
15487,you ever feel like you really really need to talk to someone but at the same time feel like you do not deserve to? or feel really embarrassed even thinking about it? its all in my fucking head confusion,Suicidal
13714,I am a trans woman who suffers from BPD ADHD and severe anxiety. I feel like I just cannot go on. I have been suicidal since my teenage and i have attempted suicide twice. My last resort was starting HRT which made me significantly less miserable but since I am still ugly and my progress seems to have stopped after 2 years I have no hope anymore. I do not think that i would be ever able to look at myself in the mirror and not want to throw up.I hate that I have adhd and bpd these mental illnesses have ruined my life not to mention the gender dysphoria which makes me cry every day. Sometimes i do not look at the mirror for days just to keep my sanity.I just cannot accept that i will look like this for the rest of my life I cannot accept that nobody knows me as a woman but rather a predatory straight man. Just the other day my father said that I am transitioning to be able to have easier access to women and rape them. As a rape victim who was raped everyday at the age of 7 by my coach and later on by my classmates at high school its so fucking unfair. I have internalized this fear and when around other women i just feel like I am occupying a space that is not for me and its wrong of me to be there. I am always afraid when I go out since I have been beaten up severely twice in the past and I am always sexually physically and verbally harassed when I am out. I have lost almost all of my friends to transmisogyny and I am sure I will always be alone. The only people who want to date me are fetishizers who see me as an exotic creature between man and woman. I have never been able to find sb who does not see me like that.Nothing will change and I will always be in pain. So the wisest thing is to end things but i do not have the courage. Both times i attempted I chickened out. I am sure i will do the same again. But i cannot endure this hell anymore either. I feel suffocated There is no place in this world for girls like me and I just want out.,Suicidal
18445,Just kind of want to let it out and text some one for the first time in awhile preferably some one in there teens and going for a hard time aswell Looking for somebody to talk to,Suicidal
9973,I am tired of living in a world full of judgment and killing each other I am tired of my family criticizing me and my sisters weight every time i get them in trouble unintentionally i feel guilty like its my fault i feel like I am holding everyone else weight I am tired of having people always coming to me with there problems but they never ask how I am really feeling i feel tired i feel overworked i feel underachieve I am tired of people always expecting more from me I am tired of people always making fun of my sister saying she is fat I am tired of people always making fun of me saying I am skinny what are we supposed to be? I am tired of this judgmental society I am tired of living i want to die is that wrong? I am tired,Suicidal
16619,Or at least slightly less painful How to die painlessly and quickly?,Suicidal

8517,I am not even sure what is real anymore. I feel like I am trapped inside of a bad dream begging to wake up. I do not remember what normal feels like I just know the pain and the emptiness. it is been like this for eleven years I cannot take it anymore. I think I am too far gone,Suicidal
17246,I fucking did it again. I hurt someone again and left them miserable. I am tired of this bullshit. I cannot believe I made them feel comfortable talking to me and hurt them in the end. Who the fuck is giving me the right and freedom to hurt and disappoint people? Never have I been able to make someone happy. Not once. Even in the slightest bit. Might as well end it guys. Failed the first two times. Third time is the charm. To the people I hurt I am genuinely sorry. I am not nice to be around. I am out. I did it again.,Suicidal
18772,Does anyone do this? I cannot stop. I keep looking around my friends house trying to work out the most optimal place to kms,Suicidal
14171,Around 2017 I found myself in a really shitty situation. My friends turned out to be the worst people on the fucking planet as they had made me chase them so far for their real friendship that I was at a point that I had no one else left. I did not feel like I could ask my family for help at that point but when I finally came to and dropped those bottom feeding shit lords I had run out of crossroads and was frustrated. I threw myself into games Overwatch Minecraft Call of Duty it did not matter to me. I stayed in that same situation until the pandemic. I do not mean it got better it got fucking worse as I could not go outside at all and as a direct result of that it became quite literally all I did. At this point I got some records in Overwatch and a few other games which had validated in my mind that this was what I was built to do. I then met someone who I thought actually might not be a toxic cunt but as of now I am having doubts because I think my damaged social skills and autism kind of made her turn her back to me. I do not even know at this point but I do not want to get more stuck in than I already am do not have anyone else I can talk to or go outside with but I also do not want to become a lifeless living thing. I am having darker thoughts as of yet which have always lingered but have been amplified because of her sort of avoiding me. I threw myself into games and cannot get back out,Suicidal
11800,My older sister has been suicidal since I was seven 10 years ago and has gotten worse lately. I was putting away laundry and found a sock with razorblades and a blank piece of paper. I was thinking of hiding it but I am not sure if it would make things worse since she is an adult and can just buy more. I cannot tell our parents since they have both been mentally abusive our whole lives. My mom never reacts well to these things since this is not an uncommon thing in my family normally threatening to commit too. My sister has always complained about my mom's tactics. Would it be wrong to hide it? Would it be wrong to suggest my mom get her into a hospital? I need advice on finding a possible note,Suicidal
16115,Just took 25 pills idk if imma be here when i wake up and honestly i do not really care ,Suicidal
20830,I wanted to try and last longer for those few I love. But I do not think I can deal with this illness nor empty future anymore I have lost the last of my desires I just simply have no energy or enjoyment for them anymore. I am just a corpse that starts everyday at 5 battery trying to conserve what little I have and cope but it only seemingly gets worse and I am at the point where I feel there is nothing left.it is so dark now and this time it is not going away no matter how many days pass.What did the little Mars rover say again?My battery is low and it is getting dark. I think my end is coming.,Suicidal
11324,I am gone. Today marks 5 years being involuntarily single. I have gone through the 5 stages of grief a dozen times been through therapy until my therapists gave up on me and referred me to someone who would also give up and refer me and rinse and repeat I have attended selfimprovement classes gotten makeovers with professional advice lost weight and gotten fit improved my social confidence attended numerous programs and groups and activities tried online dating tried blind dating but my dates walked out when they saw me tried friends setting me up but the woman says to my friends she would not date me in a thousand years moved towns travelled the country travelled to other countries and travelled to Japan and learned Japanese and when that did not work did the same for Germany trying to meet women from different cultures. In all this time after all this pain and sweat and effort and periods of just trying to let it happen on its own trying to make it happen going back to not trying. And now I am realizing I am marked from birth to be alone. So goodbye to you all. Yes it is Aaron. And I will always love you D even though you never loved me. Done with empty promises empty advice.,Suicidal
24340,NOTHING is happening anymore I am completely in pain. I have never been like this before. I AM A TEENAGER. I should NOT be feeling like this. Every night I go to sleep hoping I die in my sleep. That I never wake up ever again and have to deal with this pain I go through EVERY FUCKING DAY. I am tired of it. I lost that one person in my life for another boy and its been what like 2 years now and I am still not over her. People say oh you will be fine in a week which is total bullshit. I cannot stop thinking about ending it because nobody gives two shits about me in school and out. I will not be surprised one day if I decide to end me. I have already planned out my suicide how am going to do it where only question is when? Well when I have nothing to live for. When all my family have passed away and I have nothing.. that is when Ill do it. I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF THIS BULLSHIT.,Suicidal
15731,I gave myself a year to try to be happy. But I am not. My therapist sucks and always ask the same three questions. My medication stop me from feeling anything which at first was great because anger and sadness were gone. But then I was just completely empty. I felt nothing. So I changed it to something stronger. But it' s exactly the same.Sometimes I feel great. Like oh great today I do not want to die ! And the rest of the times I just wish things were done. Quiet silence. No pain no regrets just the wonderful emptiness that is death. And in those days I have no one to call.No one is here to give me a hug to say I love you and to listen to me cry. I have parents a sister and friends but no one to call to say I need help. Please hold me. Please anyone... In those days I just want to know what keeps me from dying. I just want to be happy for once without guilt or shame. Is that too much to ask ? And why am I still alive ? I have no one to call,Suicidal
26236,english is not my first language sry is there is any mistakes Lately I have become really selfaware of the world I am living especially since the pandemic which honestly does not scare me a lot I am more scared of the way the govern is controlling us now sry I am really damm afraid of the future of the current politic and social changes...I am scared that my life will be meaningless. From a young age I always thought I would end up killing myself someday some days I still believe that is how I am going to pass away. But lately it is a daily thought. I have been to therapy for a long while did not help. I am afraid to ask for help because my life is not even special enough to deserve people's attention. I am way too scared of the future,Suicidal
11634,This is not a sad thing I have come to realize. I am not sad about not wanting to exist. I am indifferent. I have no desire to participate in life.I care for nothing I do not care about anything.I am on here because I am not sure what to do about it. I wish I could voluntarily donate my body to science so I could contribute to humanity in some way.I am not cut out for this life and nor do I care to be.Apathy is the only thing I feel. My life holds no meaning or value and I have made peace with that.I wish there was a simple way to go. If there was Id be gone long ago. I do not have the desire to exist anymore.,Suicidal
23586,I have no idea what I am doing with my life.These day I fell like i am nothing i do not matter at all and honestly I really want to kill myself everyday. I cannot even hold a knife without thinking about shoving that shit in my chest.My mom just scream around and complains about everything my dad is always angry my sister is a egomaniac who thinks i am a piece of crap. Everybody on my life just seem to hate me and i just do not see why i should not do it. I do not know what I am saying.,Suicidal
25824,I have been on a steady decline for a couple months now and I am thinkin I am at my stop. I tried to get better and get help changed my meds added meds but I am all out of juice. I do not have much to live for. I am living alone in my apartment with no job on my 5th year if college. I am in a major I am too late to back out of and hate very much. I have isolated myself from the world and only go outside to get weed or groceries. Otherwise I am playing video games and avoiding my online class and feeling incredibly guilty for not having a job like all my peers. Its anxiety inducing to the point of breakdown to even think about doing interviews. I know please do not judge me. 98 of my days in the past few months I have had no social interaction whatsoever besides texting my only friend who has now given up on me. She told me i need I need more help than she can give. I get it. But she is been writing off my emotions for a while now anyways so its not surprising I guess. The isolation has killed me. I have lost a lot of ability to socially interact. I know I can be stable. In I highschool I played sports and was friends with half my class. I was able to function and even hold relationships. I am diagnosed bipolar but its ramped up gears 10 fold since freshman year of college. I liked to go birdwatching. I liked to go camping. I liked being around people. I liked playing video games with my friends. Its sad I miss that the most. I still find a little joy in playing team games to get at least a little social interaction. But I have none of that left now thanks to this disease. so what is the point? I do not think there is one anymore. If I kill myself the only ones who would know are my parents who have never supported me emotionally or took mental health seriously. I do not even have anyone to say goodbye to i think I am close to the end,Suicidal

8491,Is been a while since i posted and left the things halfways. I explained how I was forced to quit from a well paying work and have been unable to recover economically since. I have severe trust issues now and have become very bitter and cynical. Last time I also told you about how i started wandering alone afterwork looking for troubles until i was finally assaulted and went so far as to goad my aggressor to pull the trigger on me. So I started therapy. I was still being somewhat supported by both my exs one helped me find a place to stay and try to recover enough to find a job again and the other one lend me her shoulder and listened to me whenever she could i was grateful for that. Then the therapist made me realize a few things. First of all that i was right to be depressed my story was harsh and she was amazed i went for so many years without looking for help. I told her that i already do things to stave off depressions since i sculpt write and do digital art as a hobby but lately that was not enough i felt and i still feel like i do not get joy from it anymore. She suggested we started with telling her about myself about my relation with my family with my friends etc. So it turned out that i was not only depressed but had repressed over 20 years of anger since i always acted as a mediator or a problem solver i barely ever let out my anger be shown. I have adandomnent issues because of a very traumatic episode that ocurred when i was five and is something that keeps on dragging with both my ex's leaving me at some point although both cases were amiable enough i got hurt and moved on or tried to move on. This feels like senseless ramble sorry. So i quited my job on the call center. I move cities again and had to stop seeing my therapist because of money being short. I started working at a winestore and i kept bashing my head against the boss's. He was an idiot. I also understood that i have a very difficult time working with people face to face. I am not only assertive but also quick to lash out against costumers and the boss if i feel atacked somehow. I left the place after a year they did not fire me because even though all the fights i was a good worker and one of the few that did not quit after 2 weeks of work because of it being too hard. I left on my own volition after a discussion about the contract and since i was a petty jerk y waited enough to time my quitting with the holydays so bossman would have to cover my absence himself. Just after quitting i got on a fight with a close friend and my landlord decided to evict me just because. Actually i know the reason but since the place was offered by a friend i took it at something they would go backsies later on. Trust issues man. Since i was getting evicted i stopped looking for a job took my stuff and returned to my folks places which does not make me happy. I was wanting to burn my savings on the therapy again but i felt bad about using money while not having a job then covid came and jobs became more difficult to get. One of my ex's finally decided to push me into drawing lewds for commission. It was an old idea i never truly tried because I am not comfortable about it is not something i like. But my regular art never got attention. With her help i created a super cornygirlynonethreatening handler for deviant and off i went to draw shit for other people. She just asked me to never show her the stuff and i could comply with that since i m not comfortable letting anyone else that i know see it although close friends have been warned. I started to get some traffic with it some commissions. I started saving money again and thought of calling my therapist again to see how we could work into improving myself or my life since i ve never stopped having suicidal thoughts. Then my ex let me know that she was having a hard time being there for me she made me feel as a liability and cut contact with me completely. And i had a meltdown she had been my closest friend through the whole ordeal and now she leaves. So instead of calling my therapist to improve myself i tell her i feel miserable wronged sad and still want to die. I want the pain to stop I am more scared of keep hurting than of died a week before a roof almost fell over me and i did not even react. I am numb to that but i do not like hurting I am tired of that. I am tired of this so why should i drag this on? And now I also understand that I feel emotionally alone and even if a stop feeling hurt that will not change easily. TLDR random rant and followup to last post. My world just got smaller follow up,Suicidal

8279,After being lonely for so many years as a teenager when I found a girlfriend that I thought to be loving told me that she does not want me to move in with her while she is at Uni.While being lonely these years I read about philosophy particularly about stoicism and other philosophies which are related to it and they helped me to keep going but right now I feel like nothing can help me.Last week I tried overdosing on paracetamol before finding out that is one of the worst drugs to od on.And of course it barely affected me.But holy shit finding out tonight that she does not want me to come with her I felt like an absolute shit being.I expected this to be honest but I did not how I would deal with it and now I just want to off myself.Somehow I knew this moment will come and I abused alcohol and now combining with paracetamol I began to feel even worse by the day.I know that liver failure can because a painful death but I honestly cannot take it anymore. I am sorry for any grammar mistakes english is not my native language. I honestly cannot take it anymore.,Suicidal
25950,My best friend's dad died today at 58. My dad decided to go away from me and now I am living with my mom I am 17. My girlfriend told me today after 2 years and a half of seeing eachother everyday that our relationship is coming to an end... I just want to be the next to die at this point. The universe went down on me with 3 losses in a day.,Suicidal
17948,I do not really have a person i can talk to on a deep level so I am going to word vomit a bit right now. The past week has been pretty good i reached some pretty big personal goals and even went on a wonderful trip with some friends. But today since i woke up I have been getting hit with these big waves of sadness disappointment and selfhate. I tried to meditate which usually helps but i ended up just feeling worse and started crying. Even crying usually makes me feel relieved but right now all i feel is this never ending pain and despair. I know if i tough it out and continue working hard on myself ill be okay eventually. But waiting on time is really starting to feel insufferable and i do not know how much longer i can go. I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts and I have always been able to subside them but it sorta feels like I am going to lose this fight. As I am writing this i feel myself disconnected from my body so i think I am dissociating haha do not know where else to post this do not know who to turn to,Suicidal

20540,Literally none. Idk what to do anymore. Nothing will make anyone around me happy. I am sick of being a financial burden.

22811,I do not have a dentist. I do not have any healthcare I do not think anyone does actually. I called around hoping to get a prescription for penicillin or erythromycin hoping I could get a dental appointment. Everyone assumes that people are lying and using an abscess as an excuse to try to get opiates. I am in a lot of pain. A lot. This tooth looks like the jagged top of a mountain erupting from my gums. I look like I got punched in the jaw. I need a prescription for antibiotics. I cannot get it. They would prefer I die. And at this point I hope I do. I fucking hate all of you. You fucking selfish greedy fucking monsters. I wish my death could mean something. It means nothing. I am just worthless stupid sack of human fucking garbage. I have an abscess and want to die,Suicidal
17170,Hi so usually i come back to this subreddit when shit hits the fan and I cannot handle it anymore. I do not really know how to start with these it is always difficult especially with all the emotion and pain but I guess I will start with what is bothering me right now. I had this girlfriend in 2017 and I deeply regret how things ended with her and I I also regret ending it because i did it thinking that I had no love for her and that I was only in the relationship for the sex. What I learnt though this was in early 2018 with therapy was that I had intrusive thoughts what had happened was that this thought of not loving her had popped up in my head at some point and I could not stop thinking about it while in the relationship with her. It was horrible I felt as if I was lying to her throughout the relationship. it is like having a person on your shoulder shouting liar every moment my only peace was away from her. I saw the only way out was to say I do not love you anymore. I was 19 at the time and so was she so we were both young but I hate myself still to this day for doing that and not maybe discussing it first with someone. She was my first love how we met was pretty magical we were sitting across from one another and I started to sing one her favourite band songs and she looked at me and we both began discussing our favourite bands and interests. I knew in that instance that I was attracted to her without a doubt and i think she was as well. The worst part I think about that breakup was that I had no one at varsity to talk to anymore I was alone with all those thoughts and I started hating the world even more nearly as much as I hated myself. I think that was the worst moment in my life worse than anything else. Because I felt like a monster for hurting someone I loved something I thought I would not do. I wish I could kill myself I wish I could plunge a knife into my neck and bleed out until i pass out until I am nothing with no thoughts just a fucking corpse. Maybe then everything will be calm and I would not have to worry about making mistakes like that again. I am too much of coward anyway i do not like pain. This all started because of old voice note that might have been her. Funny. Sorry about the violent imagery. I just wanted to talk. Just talking.,Suicidal
37310,Hers my view from Canada ..for what its worth. More than half of you did..or he wouldnt be president..he treats his friends like shit..everyone is now his enemy..the USA has lost ALL respect from here..we want tou to build the wall here..cause we just dont trust you anymore..,Suicidal

17413,there is no getting better there is not a single soul that can help. I have a knife in my hand ready to cut myself and I feel nothing. Was any of this ever worth it? This world broke me so much I do not feel anything anymore,Suicidal
24957,My first post so here it goes. Ill try and make this short. I am 37 and have been dealing with Gad and depression since I was 17. I have tried every medication that is out there with varying results. I have been off work since December 2 due to my anxiety and a pain condition. Things have only gotten worse with the stress of being off work and dealing with the insurance company. I am starting to have issues with my thinking I get confused when I am speaking or lose concentration and forget what I am talking about. I feel this text may come off incoherentI could sit here and edit it forever but this is how me brain works. As I write this I am forgetting the point of this text. I never wanted to kill my self more and had to come off Lyrica because of it I see a psychiatrist and psychologist and do not feel they understand me. I am slightly concerned I am getting to the point where I have rationalized suicide. The idea that its never ok to kill your self seems flowed to me. There must be a point killing your self becomes the humane thing to do. I understand this thinking sounds fucked. My objective is to find input on my theory or help me explain how my thinking is distorting my logic. Thoughts of suicide sucks.,Suicidal
26953,I do not know why but I am constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I did not really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one did not really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just do not fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I have had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I could not cut. I kind of feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I cannot talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I am sorry if this was too long a read. I am Lonely,Suicidal
26171,English is not my first language so I am sorry if there is any grammatical mistakes. I am currently 23 and about to turn 24 this year. I have graduated from a university last year but have yet to find myself a job due to this unknown sickness. It happens whenever I get emotional or under a hot temperature my body will just overheat and causes immense unbearable psychological pain burning needle and itching sensation. I have no idea how to get rid of it the only instant solution to this is by taking a cold and ice bath but that is impossible if you are outdoor and I can only rely on a water spray to minimize the pain and keep my body slightly cool. Sadly that does not help much either since it is hard to spray under your clothing in public and the partly hot partly cold and wet feelings just make it even worse.This has kept me from doing any kind of activities and even leaving my room I have been telling my parents about this since 3 years ago but they did not take it seriously and all they cared are whether I get my degree or not. Although they did not force me into finding a job after I have graduated they still proceeded to ignore my issue and feelings because according to their logic they think I am just overly stressed and needed some time off and while some part of this is true what i really needed are some medical advice and treatment yet they just remains silent everytime I bring this up or just shift the topic to job seeking and how tolerable they are for allowing me to take an year off . what is worse is my dad is a doctor and my mom is a former nurse...And here I am being a shut in everyday because it hurts going outside. Yes I know this is not a permanent solution and I cannot stay like this forever but what can i do ? Can I even work like a normal person if I itch and suffer from psychological pain every 2 second ? Fuck no. I do not even know what is wrong with my body and what is the name of this disease or what sort of doctor should I seek for. it is even funnier to think that I can get itchy and pain just by drinking a hot soup or walking. At this point I am just a useless piece of junk that can only stay in my bed and rant on the internet. I seriously have no idea what to do anymore. Even if I type this out nothing will change and noone can help. I suffer from an unknown pain everyday for the last 3 years and I just want to end everything now.,Suicidal
8399,I want to kms as a means of avoidance. I am too tired for life and I am tired of having to run away from my own mind at 100 mph. I probably have ocd and my stupid meds do not fucking work I hate it they made me jittery like a shot of adrenaline and cloudy at the same time so I stopped taking them. That were my last hope. Its just kind of sad knowing that some people just get the short end of the stick and there is nothing you can do about it. And even sadder knowing that I am one of those people. I got a shit life and a shit brain that nobody understands. It all just makes life seem kind of empty and pointless. I am SO TIRED OF LIVING ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY BODY I cannot fucking do this anymore. It hurts even more having to see my moms face everyday finally happy and stable unknowing that I am going to put a bullet in my brain soon. I already got the gun My mom does not know that I am going to put a bullet in my brain soon,Suicidal

13252,I just bought a helium tank and everything I need. It was exhausting going out so I do not want to do the deed yet. I want to do it when I am feeling good enough to do it probably. The helium tank in in the back of my car so hopefully my friends will not look in there. I also put the other things in there. I hope they will not ask me to drive anywhere soon. I will probably do it tomorrow. If they found me out that would be fucked. I also want to be sure of my friends work shifts that day and how long they will be gone. I do not want to do it now and one of them pull up. So yeah if everything goes well I will be free. Going to die soon.,Suicidal
21962,I just hate my life and myself. No one likes me or wants to talk to me. It has striped the joy of everything I do. I feel so pointless for doing anything what is the point if no one cares???? My family is an abusing pieces of shit and I am unlovable I do not know what to do. I cannot be independent due to my illness toI tried many times to make friends with no avail. I am just too boring for them and nobody cares. I cannot focus on anything my health is deteriorating and there is no one I can turn into. I want to die please pleaseee 22 I want to die I am suffering with no one there,Suicidal
16390,I know this may sound bizarre but personally I will rather die at a young age than at an old age. I do not want to spend all of my life going through pain depression and mood swings. I have made stupid mistakes and sins so what is the point of keep living until you reach to the old age when you can just end now without having to wait for a long time. I may not kill myself but I do want to die. For now I am thinking about getting shot in a head a robber hoodlum or any criminal that will later get caught one day hence Ill die a young age. I do not want to die an old age. Its too long and it just does not feel right since I love to be young and youth. Ill rather die young than to die an old age,Suicidal
12259,I just I just want to be sensitive but I guess that is a negative thing all of a sudden. I cannot let out my anger or pain I just have to fake a smile and act like everythings alright I hate how emotionless and cold some people are towards me,Suicidal
8183,I am going through a huge rough patch right now and I know it will get somewhat better eventually. But the parts of my life where I am somewhat happy are so few and far between. It never feels like good times will last. Is living a life where 90 of it is pain and 10 is good really worth it? The good times are not worth waiting for.,Suicidal
25715,I am 15 and ever since I started puberty everything went downhill for me. I realized all the harsh things about reality that I wish I never knew. Especially being online all the time surrounded by so much negativity and hatefulness. It probably does not sound like a big deal but its too much for me to handle especially when I feel alienated from everyone and like I am a terrible person. I struggle with so many unwanted thoughts and feelings that I feel like the only way Id find peace is when I am dead. I am constantly surrounded by so much misery its too hard to take in and process. I do not know if this is just teen angst but its a horrible feeling. I wish everything was nicer and easier that I do not have to deal with difficult feelings. I feel like I am the only one struggling with the conflicting thoughts I have. I tried finding people who feel the same way but I could not making me feel even more alienated. I am afraid that one day Ill break and actually kill myself. I do not want to live but at the same time I do. I do not have anyone close to me that I can express my feelings to and if I just keep my feelings to myself I am going to continue drowning deeper and deeper into my misery. I am starting to feel like I do not deserve to live,Suicidal
23476,I finally feel at peace. My whole life I have been tormented by everyone else but now I will finally have my escape to a better place.

20945,What hurts more? Staying just for more bad shit to happen to you or the last few seconds of your life because once you are gone you do not have to feel anything anymore so is not the pain of dying worth it?

8453,At least i assume they are. Every once in a while i get a chat request from some woman asking to click a link to view pics or have fun. I also get links from people claiming to be experts on depressionsuicide and asking to try a product. Obviously i do not mean the people who see my posts and ask out of concern i appreciate those people.

7565,26M. I have been thinking about suicide a lot lately I am unsure of what went wrong in my life for me to even think this way but I do not feel like I am living I already feel dead. I have never had a girlfriend and will probably never find love which is pretty much all anyone needs. I am a virgin. I am ugly. I am broke. I have never even been called attractive by a woman and its starting to weigh really heavily on me that Ill probably never find a love. I am unloveable and unwanted and if this is all life has to offer me I am better off dead so people do not have to put up with me being sad and a waste of space all the time. My heart really hurts and I am not having fun here. I have been thinking about suicide.,Suicidal
18783,Some days I am able to distract myself on other days I simply get reminded of how worthless I am and that I am not really made for life or current society. I feel highly uncomfortable as myself in my body in my skin. I just want to disappear. No one close to me would actually miss me everyone is too distant. I am merely an air molecule to them. I always end up feeling neglected and its probably my fault my selfblaming is pathetic. I sound like a pickme girl I wish I could just shut up for a second. I feel like dying every single day.,Suicidal

22511,I used to white knuckle through the swings of anxiety and depression post service and the feeling of being bereft like I was suspended in time a ghost of the past unable to connect with the people of today but I had one thing hope. Hope that better days would come and the mantra of someone has it worse than I do..but the more I try to think about it maybe Hope is not a blanket covering for all people but just like most things hope picks its targets like buckshot spread and sporadic with no rhyme to its reason. The more I begin to see it as that I begin to wonder what I am holding out for when each place i move holds the glimmer of a feeling of home until the newlywed stage passes and feelings of old return. At first I did not worry much because my negative thoughts and feelings were minimal able to be compartmentalized and buried but now I feel like a Dutch boy with his finger in the Dam knowing it will not hold back the river. I am really not sure what I hope to accomplish posting this Is hope for everyone?,Suicidal
21209,The money I was saving was my only hope to get to where I want to be. I cannot wait any longer. I have been saving for a year now after struggling heavily with alcoholism depression anxiety and isolation for the last seven years which in turn caused me to fail and drop out of college two years ago after six years. I was never able to gethold a job for very long until the past year and I was starting to feel somewhat better about myself myself until I passed up on the opportunity to make 50000 in the stock market in January guess from what?. Missing that golden opportunity caused me to chase getting that money once again and it caused me to lose 11k nearly 6 months of paychecks. I had opportunities to have the best life ever since I got out of high school and I have messed all of them up. Now I am a 26 year old virgin friendless college dropout loser who lives with his parents. I have no social skills trade skills or talents. I am useless. There is nothing special about me. All I do is make my mom more depressed than she already is due to my failures. I just want to not think anymore as I am drowning in shame and regret. I do not know why I did this to myself. But I did and I cannot undo it. The only thing I can do is jump off a cliff or smoke cigarettes until my lungs collapse and hope that life is all just a nightmare. I know no one can really help. I want nothing more than to be okay and be a loving positive force in the world but my mind is just too fucked up. Lost half of my life savings in the stock market. I should have taken profits while I could but I got greedy and lost money instead. It has truly crushed me because I have nothing else.,Suicidal
14025,I work a lot... to the point where some days its all i do is wake up travel to work work often staying late and travel home and sleep. When i get home my mother is instantly on my back about something or the other. She abused me and gaslights me. I am so tired of life. I am so tired of people needing me to do things but also never needing me to do things. Maybe that does not make sense... I am prepared to die... I am so close to done... I cannot do it anymore,Suicidal
13879,There was a narcissists in my life slowly trying to destroy me. It took me a while to realize.. they were trying to steal my friends copy my personality. They would slowly chip away at my selfesteem and even try to turn others against mespreading rumors etc. I feel so free now that I have no contact with them. I moved made new friends and deleted my personal social media. Yeah life still gets hard and I get sad sometimes. But nothing is as bad as being involved with them. People really underestimate how insidious these people are. I finally figured out why my life was so bad,Suicidal
