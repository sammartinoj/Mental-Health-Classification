89,Just looking for some advice. First a little backstory sorry if a bit long. Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough I us an ecigarette as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulderblade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.My doctor said everything felt normal my blood pressure was normal as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an xray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out tight chest sweating vomiting trouble sleeping just overall freaking out about what that xray might show. Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest trouble sleeping with bad thoughts and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. I also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate between 59 when I sleep and 120ish when i'm up working. Sorry for the wall of text I am just hoping someone here could give me some tips on managing this stress. I have a yearly physical next month that can't get here soon enough.Thank you.,Anxiety,0,Stress,FALSE

323,I hate that my only option is to wait The only solution to the things that have me feeling anxious is to wait. There's no other way around it and I hate it so much. It's leaving me with too much time to think and I can't do anything to distract myself because that just fuels my anxiety in some weird roundabout way.I can't even find the words to vent my emotions properly because my mind is so muddled. I'm not able to distract myself much so I don't know what to do.,Anxiety,0,Stress,FALSE
333,My and my wifes past trauma is causing lots of friction in our marriage Mine is mostly about past jobs I had that I hated that gave me lots of anxiety and I didnt like how my boss talked to me Hers is about past relationship trauma where guys would talk to her wrong andor hit her Sometimes shell be explaining how to do something to me and if I dont immediately get it her tone of voice will raise a little which increases my anxiety and weakens my ability to focus which makes her more frustrated with me which makes me angry and now were both triggered and yelling at each other and hurting each others feelings repeat cycle every 2 weeks or so weve been married for a year and a half nowIve tried telling her how what she sayshow she says it affects me sometimes but she doesnt think theres anything wrong with what shes doing Help?,Anxiety,0,Stress,FALSE

448,Here we go again EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in 2016. It was BRUTAL but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up and after an assessment it appears that Im in need of a tune up as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... Im starting it again today. I hope that itll be a little less sucky since Ive put some hard work into it previously and that itll be shortlived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. Im still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything? PS For the record Im not trying to scare anyone who is facing the possibility of going through this process. Doing EMDR has changed my life for the better. Ive had PTSD as long as I can remember and the relief that its brought me has been amazing. Just stick it out until it gets better.,Bipolar,1,Stress,FALSE

493,Hypersensitivity Does anyone else suffer with extreme hypersensitivity? Stress really pushes me to lose all control and react in withdrawal tears fear and extreme reckless behavior like quitting my job because in that moment I'd give my arm to get away.

2102,Need some advice For the last two years Ive been in a state of frustration in which I cant seem to get out of. I feel like a live in a backwards culture that doesnt care or give two shits about intimacy and relationships. Before COVID I had a shot opportunity to get in a arranged marriage because certain conditions were available. Please Do not bring up dating because its not a thing where Im from. But after COVID every thing that I planned for got screwed over and now parents refuse to arrange a marriage until I graduate. To be in a relationship early on in my life was never negotiable thing for me. I have lost interest in literally everything I used to find enjoyable. Tv shows Gaming Connecting with friends you name it. I also stopped having conversations with my parents. The only thing as of recently Ive been doing Is take a shit load of coursescredit hours and spend 90 of my time just focusing planing and revising how I could be done with this with least time possible. Im CE Major and Ive been powering through it all. But Ive been also worried how being In this state for too long would affect me in the future.

2139,I've been struggling but I think this is the last straw.. My mom died last Oct I've been fighting legal battles with my stepbrothers that dropped surprise court papers on me that basically said fuck you in mid Dec. They were supposed to be filing an estate immediately but took their time until they conspired enough support and stolen everything they wanted. Last month the legal battles were supposed to be over they withdrew they are not over...Just under a month ago I began the laborious task of moving 20yrs of stuff with little to no help. The things the stepbrothers stole like truck and trailer would of helped tremendously in moving and storage.This last weekend I began swapping some of my mom's stuff out for mine and disposing of some of it. I moved half of it to the curb and kept back a working fridge and a couch.Then I got sick I'm still sick.Garbage came Tuesday and still sick I halfheartedly worked on my mess...as the local neighbor rookie gunhobcop drop by...he seen me working... I seen him see me.Today I received a citation for non working appliances it's a nuisance...except they do work...well the fridge did. I removed the doors as the officer I called and spoke to advised. Then I proceeded to fill my sidewalk with ever single bit of stuff I don't want.This same cop started dating a girl down the street last year at some point who recently turned 18...Around this time my step dad died and mom had cancer I was having financial troubles and gas was 5Gallon. I asked on local Facebook pages trying to get a charger for my electric trimmer to no avail. Eventually my grass was exactly the height max allowed..in spots...so naturally this same cop took it upon themselves to send me a citation. When complaining about the citation on a local page I was told if I can't afford to mow my grass I should pay someone to do it.........like wtf...I just want to mourn my mother's death but even after months of struggling nonstop I can't take 2 days off to be sick. Fuck farmington il fuck fpd fuck Officer M. Carlock.,Depression,2,Stress,FALSE
2144,I don't know what I'm doing anymore I feel overwhelmed to the point of exhaustion. When I'm at work I have to be 100 all the time but I can't do that. I've tried looking at other jobs with the same or better pay and same hours but nothing has worked out. I can't keep up with my household chores or duties. I feel like I'm a burden every time I ask for help. I feel like there's no point but to give up.,Depression,2,Stress,FALSE
2809,I cant do a push up. My arms are almost useless. I need to get surgery but my parents aren't exactly in the picture and can't support me while I take time off of work to get the surgery.

2814,I'm pretty broke and almost all of my money for now is going towards bills and food. I have my state's basic free insurance OHP Oregon Health Plan but I'm not sure what kind of psychological services they could provide. I'm hesitant to start a regimen of anxiety medications if it's possible to work through things. Open to any advice. Thank you very much in advance.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2815,I'm running out of ideas for how we can talk to one another more often. I know it's going to get worse. She'll be starting grad school in August. I've been through grad school already myself and I know how time consuming it is. She'll be busy.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2819,He's exactly what I've needed maintains his side of an equal partnership etc. My only problem is that though our sex life is great I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes even if he shows no interest that occasional day then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day. It's not like we never do anything I just seem to still be attached to this idea. He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations. I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2825,Well last time we fought I did finally call. I was so fucking scared and while he hid in the basement with all the doors locked and light off the cops took pictures of my hands and neck while I asked them over and over not to arrest him. They told me it will be up to the judge when he sees the pictures. Well what do you know he got a warrant. He didn't show up to the first court date so I know he's in even more trouble now.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2829,I don't feel at all like he doesn't like me or has gone off me we meet once a week and 'chat' daily but I'm kind of unhappy I'm not getting the 'cant get enough of talking' experience that usually comes along with being enamoured at the start. I nearly always reply within 20 mins if I'm not busy because I'm still in the excited pahse but I get a lot of 34 wait times with a read receipt with him coming on and off whatsapp within that period before I get a reply. It hardly screams that he's really into me when he is ok to wait that long to reply. I assume he's messaging others so why not me? I'm his new potential gf!,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2832,Thing is after we broke up we had sex a few times in August and September and as far as I'm aware she has slept with at least one other guy in this period too. The real question is what do i do now? I want to tell the guy about this and wish someone would've done the same to me 2 years ago. But at the same time I'm one of her exes is it really my fight to take? tldr Ex probably cheated on her new boyfriend with me should i tell him or just stay out of it?,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2834,Well I've been on an antidepressant now and I definitely feel less depressed and motivated but my anxiety has gotten slightly worse. I explained all my symptoms to the dr I saw today and expressed my concerns to her about taking benzos every day family history of addiction and I find myself to have a very obsessive personality. and she totally agreed with me and said I probably have GAD along with the depression. She added an antiseizure med as a mood stabilizer and told me that should hopefully level out how I am feeling and take care of the anxiety that is probably being brought on by the antidepressant. I am so happy that a dr actually listened to me.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2835,But unfortunately everyone refuses to do so. Now I guess my question is how do I ... 1 Seperate myself emotionally from him? 2 Be more assertive when dealing with him? 3 Build myself up to be a confident and self reliant person that doesn't hit rock bottom every time I deal with him?,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2836,It all is just so tiresome you know?. I am 37 with autism chronic PTSD pretty strong quiet borderline traits and depression. I have a 21 year old sister with full blown not at all quiet BPD who came over last evening and spent several hours trying to talkguilt me into going to an uncles house to find her grass.

2843,I've hit a roadblock and I need your help. I created a Gofundme campaign just to try and get my foot in the door. You can check it out at url and please if you're not able to donate please share it with anyone you know who might or any groups you might be a member of who might help. I'm 30 years old now and have nothing to show for it and I'd like to change that. Thank you all and good karma for everyone.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2845,This is mostly a reminder to myself to use the pill box I purchased awhile ago rather than just taking pills straight from the bottle. I just felt like I needed to get this out there somewhere somehow. UPDATE 020217 If you're like me you obsessively search forums like this one so I thought I'd post what happened since then. It took me awhile to find a psychiatrist that was accepting patients but I finally saw one yesterday. In regards to the strange symptoms I had as a result of taking the 2nd pill by accident she said that since 20mg is already the max dose of Lexapro taking 40mg could produce psychotic symptoms.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2849,He finally lets me inside and we begin to talk he's drunk as always our schedules differ by a couple of hours so whenever I would get home at 6 he was always drunk. He is sat up against my counter calling me names and I smack his chest. Worst mistake of my life. I never should have hit him. And I fully believe that what you dish out is what you get.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2856,But he doesn't ask either. When I do open up all I can think is He's probably bored and wishing I'll stop talking. or He hasn't contributed to this conversation once why don't I just talk to a wall? I know he cares he really does. He has voiced his frustration that he can't relate and that I struggle.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2857,My husband 29m and I 26f live across the country from our parents and have been there almost two years now. I don't really have a relationship with my inlaws mf 65ish ie they never reach out to me expect for once to ask what to get my husband for his birthday and rarely talk to my husband they don't ask about me or don't seem interest when I'm brought up and it doesn't bug me because they are incredibly negative and angry people. My fil has anger issues and will have a meltdown in public he's done it several times in front of me and my mil is self absorbed among several other issues. I don't want to get into every story and man do I have some stories but i guess it's important to know that I've been warned about their general attitude and behavior from others and everyone who has met them that I'm friends or family with has agreed with me that their son is the source of their happiness and they feed off of each others negativity. However they've never been out rightly malicious towards me.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2858,That anxiety alone can't do this. There has been times that I have been freaking out a little bit but my heart rate and blood pressure are perfect. The panic goes away quickly when I realize this. I've damn near convinced myself that I have POTS. But I've tested it out.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE

This is also taking a toll on me not being able to fall asleepwake up next to the woman of my dreams is crushing but I'm trying with all of my heart to be sympathetic.

2860,We still have up until December on this lease together. I sponsor him in this country because he cannot stay on his own. We also work together. Today he was crying and begging me not to leave him which I already had done etc. I told him he needs mental health care not for the first time and that I can't trust him after what happened on the stairs because he crossed an even worse line than he has before with verbal abuse.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2863,Hi Last night my girlfriend's mom passed away. My girlfriend has anxiety and I want to help her in every way that I can. I had in high school anxiety but never experienced loss and I want to help my girlfriend in any way that I can. She's 20 in college and I've been doing everything I can think of but I want to make sure she's okay.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2864,My sister is an alcoholic as well and also drinks too much tho not as much as this fellow. I've never been comfortable with the level of her drinking or her personal choices and I live long distance from her. I try to nudge her in more positive directions and in the past 18 months have been offering a few hundred in financial support monthly to her to help her better provide for her kids. About 6 months ago it came out that her boyfriend has been screaming in her face and laying his hands on her. Usually she beats him up as much or worse I think it's pure insanity and I told her that she needed to make physical contact a 'red line' and if I heard about it I would call the local police office and report him.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2872,People are abrasive and mean and stupid and they shit on each other all the time and are presumptive. Most people live alone. Blame your parents! Blame everything that we're not fucking perfect.

2877,He wasn't ambitious or motivated anymore he was sad depressed always pessimistic and never really doing any work. I ended up not only doing all development work but also our social PR and leg work as well here in NYC making relationships. This lead him to feel more left out I am assuming. Many times he has decided to hinder the business due to reasons related to what I mentioned. For instance one time we were creating an ad for a campaign we were running for the app.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2878,I feel really guilty over it. I know part of the problem may be how much I've repressed and can't feel but... I don't know I feel I've exaggerated so much. I haven't been having nightmares and my flashbacks don't feel like flashbacks so much as regressive anxious states. I can think of the trauma I've been through and talk about it but it doesn't feel like anything disturbing.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2880,I have had SAD for about five years and in those times I tried so many things to ease the anxiety. You know like medication therapy desensitising etc. None of those seemed to do me any good. However for the past year I have been working out nearly everyday and my anxiety has been alleviated A LOT. I can't exaggerate it it just really chills me out.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2884,Im an army reserve officer who has 6.5 years of service. I have a VA disability rating of 40 due to PTSDAnxietydepression and ringing in my ears from a tour in Afghanistan. I recently applied to go into the IRR and was turned down. I have been told that Im not deployable due to my mental health but I dont think this was at all mentioned in my IRR packet. just moved for a job in DC and my old unit is now too far to travel to.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2886,I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on. Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much. Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous my heart beats really fast my limbs feel like jelly heavy breathing I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person! I'm seeing someone about these problems but I just thought I'd ask if anyone has any extra advice they could give if things start to get a bit out of control.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2887,I hope I can remember that my anxiety was misguided and ultimately wrong. And more than that I hope that whoever reads this if anyone does can remember it too. I wasn't sure how to end this before and I am not sure how to end it now so I will leave you with one of my favorite quotes from the great Stanley Kubrick... And remember no matter how vast the darkness we must supply our own light.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2895,Sunday the 5th she went outside to drink her margarita and our 4 year old followed her she'd been ignoring us all day. I went to help my 5 year old when she called me into the bathroom.

The front door sticks for what it's worth.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2899,He would distract me while I drove us places until at one point I backed into a parked truck and I had never been the cause of an accident before. After that I was not allowed to drive my own car. I was not allowed to drive my own car at all after that unless I found the keys and snuck away which was oftentimes very difficult. The summer of 2010 he forced me to move in with him into a terrible run down duplex off campus so that he could keep his mothers pair of small under socialized dogs who were not housebroken and his sister who was with her husband to begin college classes at this same university that fall foisted her hyper 40 pound mutt on top of the burden as well.

The next message i sent was all about my day that wasnt sent anymore he was offline... i thought he was getting ready for his work and his phone died or his network... after an hour I got worried so I sent messages on all social media that he has which I know.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2906,I don't know she's forgiving and all but it's like everyone has a limit and I would understand if she did break up with me. I just wish I could tell her right now. That would be impulsive and come out of the same energy as seeing a prostitute bc I'm lonely. I just want to get the anxiety over with. Looking for support and understanding before advice but not opposed to advice if understanding is given.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2908,I just need to vent and receive some advice encouragement. I just went through major jaw surgery I replaced the TMJ joint disk with a fat graft and my mouth is now wired shut for the next 9 months. To fill the time I would have spent talking eating and generally having a good time I have instead been studying for all the standardized tests I need to go to a good college. I studied at least 4 hours a day and put a strain on my recovery this is because my upper body muscles were strained which affects my jaw and subsequently my new disk. Luckily my hard work payed off.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2912,It wasn't that long ago perhaps only a few months that I was in the darkest place that a human can be. Sitting on my kitchen floor with an empty bottle of wine and a knife on my wrist ready to end it all. And for the first time in my 25 years of existence I though about life and I though about death after all I was going to experience both within mere moments of each other. A multitude of thoughts raced through my mind. What will it be like?,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2915,I feel like platitudes are useless but I really don't know what else to say. It's gonna be fine don't worry is basically all I say when I'm not frustrated. So I need help understanding a better way to be a better person to him. x200B Thanks.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2918,I'm going to be spending only on essentials. I need some advice though. This is new territory to me. You guys got any tips for me? Oh yes and I have a gym membership so I'll be showering there now.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2919,Any problem he had he would blame on me. If I didnt take his side during an disagreement he was having with someone else he would get so mad and start with the insults. I eventually got out of the relationship and when I ended it he began obsessively texting me up to 30 times a day talking to my family and lying to them about what was happening etc. He finally stopped when I threatened a restraining order. The last time we talked was in May 2017.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2920,This made me feel somewhat uncomfortable but I laughed it off and tried to go along with it and trust him and take it as an innocent compliment. He asked if I wanted to smoke some weed with him and I knew already from past experience that I tend to have very bad reactions to it. He told me that if I freak out then he wouldnt let anything bad happen to me. I was having a pretty good day so I smoked some weed with him. It was actually okay being high.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2926,My freelance worked has finally shown some fruits as I have booked 2 events for this month a birthday and a wedding. I also just got hired to be a regular lead photographer at an events company and I start this Saturday. Now my dilemma is this I am currently financially struggling and would need a help to finally have some stability. I am looking for anyone who can LEND me money. I'm looking to borrow since I will be capable of paying back.,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
2931,Won't have any income until after I graduate so whatever I spend this shit on that's it. I have no social life anyways so I won't be missing out on anything since I just stay in my room when I'm not in class. I have a pretty terrible idea to make money that I'll need about 1200 in supplies to attempt. It doesn't involve gambling buying crypto or buying stocks. Do I do it?,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
3487,my stress always culminates with physical pain,Normal,3,Stress,FALSE
3839,The bar is so low I can't even begin to describe it. All I know how to do is play video games watch youtube and repeat the same things like a dumb monkey.The past 2 weeks I tried taking a course in computer science and I tried starting to learn Japanese. And all I can do is watch and wait for something to click in my brain.There's nothing in me. No creativity no selfsufficiency no capacity for independent thought.I don't understand how I've made it this far.I'm scared. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.,Personality-disorder,4,Stress,FALSE
3858,Overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations Social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and I have to come up with responses on the spot. There is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations or when someone is trying to sell something to you.So before these situations I often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. This makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison.There are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. For example suppose I was buying something from a shop I hand over my money and then the shop keeper just ignores me what can I actually do in that situation? Call the cops? Get a lawyer? What proof do I have that the money was mine and I handed it over? What obliges the shop keeper to give me the item I wanted? Normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place they've never been burned by it so it just works for them. But here I am worrying over every little thing that I'd rather hide away from it all if possible.,Personality-disorder,4,Stress,FALSE
3885,People don't take this disorder seriously enough. They're acting like we're just doing this to be lazy. It's not our fault our brains are like this. My birth giver is nagging and cussing me out for not going to school I understand that this could be frustrating for a parent but I already told her about my problem with going to school I risked that knowing that she's narcissistic and judgemental but even after all the explanations she still thinks going to school for me is easy. She then goes on to say kids these days are so onion skinned which means someone who has shallow tears and then goes on and say I didn't spoil you kids.Didn't it ever occur to her that maybe I'm like this because she abused us as children? That she screams at us every chance she gets? That she didn't treat us with respect and neglected us? It's not just kids these days people have been battling with mental health for hundreds of years it's just popular now because people actually value mental health now and are seeking for help.It's so funny because she acts so caring and worried when talking to my teacher but then acts so judgemental and close minded when talking to me.,Personality-disorder,4,Stress,FALSE
3903,Being uncomfortable with personal compliments A friend complimented me saying I have a good conversation I'm handsome etc. I mean didn't attack me at all the opposite actually so why does some sort of fightflight state come over me with situations like this? To me it really doesn't make sense. Unfortunately it's how I function. I have to get used to this.,Personality-disorder,4,Stress,FALSE
4632,I really fucked up. Bad. I might have derailed my entire future. I was really lucky to get the job I had. It was a miracle really. But I fucked up and lost my job within the first week. It was a great paying job with benefits and everything. But I guess I am just a fuck up? I have someone who depends on my income and now we might be living on the streets. I think I basically ruined not only my life but theirs too. TLDR My situation is hopeless...convince me otherwise? I selfsabotaged myself to the point where my life might actually be ruined,Suicidal,6,Stress,FALSE
