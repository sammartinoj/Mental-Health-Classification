659,This has been my life for years now. Just stay alive until the next day then the day after that and the day after that. I never get anywhere. Therapy does not work meds do not work. I have jumped through all the hoops society expects of me to get help. It feels like all the rationales I have used in the past to try and keep going are crumbling. I do not know why I am still here. I am just trying to survive the day,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
660,This morning I had an appointment with my mental health doctor along with my social worker. For about 15 minutes we went through the usual conversation about asking how things were with medication sleep etc.I then decided to be upfront about planning to kill myself after my birthday is done with 3rd of August. They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about. I think saying I do not want to live is the right way of putting it. Rather that I do not want to exist as I feel non existent anyway so that might as well be made a reality. I broke down for the first time on years this morning.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
662,I am about to go out on my bike with a friend. I would rather stay in my room but i promised i will be there. I am about to finally go out today,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
663,I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and put a shelter over ours heads. For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me You are going to be a doctor so you should know this. The only thing I know is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them You should have never became parents or I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parentsMy parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore.. It feels like it keeps getting worse,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

669,I got really triggered today I do not know if that is the right word I guess I just mean extremely emotionally disturbed by an article I read about how bad violence gets in prisons. How can people do such horrible things and why do none of the staff do anything to stop it? Why is prison rape so commonly joked about? it is not funny at all it is a nightmare. I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soulshattering that experience would be. I cannot stop thinking about how many people are going through that right now as I type this and about how they will continue to go through it for years or even decades. Endless suffering. I cannot stop imagining it over and over again.it is really hard for me to stop thinking about all of the agony that people and animals are put through and everytime I get triggered like this it is like every horrible thing I have seen comes racing back to the front of my mind. I once saw a video of someone grabbing a piglet by his hind legs and slamming his little head against a concrete floor. Another of probably hundreds of baby chicks being stuffed into a garbage bag and suffocated. How on earth could someone do that to tiny defenseless innocent babies? My brain becomes overwhelmed with the images of these scenes and imagining myself in their place and wanting to save them and wanting someone to save me. I do not know how to get it out of my head other than to off myself. There is so much unimaginable suffering TW violence sexual assault animal abuse,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

672,All I have to do is browse the reddit comments. You look like mom's neck beard basement dweller I would date your second chin. And I think that some of these roasts could apply to me. I am a woman. I have been told I am attractive. I think I am. I only weigh 110 lbs and I am 5'6. But I still have excess weight I gained after losing a pregnancy and being put on birth control. So the double chin comment really gets to me. Everytime I see a negative comment I think about how my closest friends could say or think the same thing about me. Especially since one of my closer guy friends is a guy I crushed on recently told and got rejected by in the nicest way possible. I have trust issues. I sometimes think I am not as great as I think I am in the moment. That my friends are internally roasting me in their heads while I look like an egotistical arrogant ahole. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Today's been rough. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation ever since I flirted with my guy friend again and made things akward. It seemed like he was flirting at first but I think I misperceived the intent in his speech and screwed up again. there is more to this story but I do not want to get into it. I cannot tell if I am overthinking paranoid and waiting for betrayal or if my intuition is on to some things. So I deacti everything. I am staying away. I personalize insults aimed at other people then want to die.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
675,My worst nightmare is coming true.My world is falling apart. I have no idea how I will tell my friends or parents. I hate that it will be confirmed that I am an idiot and that everyone will see me as one.I have always wanted to graduate and I need to for what I want to do.I am thinking that I should not be here. Future looks incredibly bleak and it is confirmed I am worthless.Literally no reason to not die besides me being too pussy to do so. Getting kicked out of school,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

678,Hi hoping this will make me feel better. This summer has been hard. I am medicated for anxietydepression have a partner I love and that is so supportive a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll especially since COVID its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic providerprovide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous anxious patients in pain and I feel like a sponge all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care nothing ishas ever been worth the copay. I used to want to have kids to give them the happy childhood I did not have but why add another burden to the planet. The future is not sustainable. Country is legit on fire nature is dying. Basic truths or facts do not matter anymorejust stupid ass culture wars to bring in ratings and profit. I remember thinking the first time I wanted to die was when I was 8. Thought Id definitely be dead before college so why worry about that. Then oh once I achieve x y and z it will get better. It has to! How can humanity have gone this long if this is the reality?

704,I was diagnosed with a thyroid tumor about 2 years ago but stopped showing up at the hospital soon after. I am 21 now. have not told about it to my parents yet because I do not want to be a burden even though I know they deserve the truth.I have been horribly ashamed of my life decisions since I was around 17 or even earlier.I work at a dead end job and the only reason I show up is out of fear of having to move back in with my parents They did make some questionable choices when I was growing up but out of love for meI am still in love with a girl I never told about my feelings.Probably just the idea of her but it is hard to tellI make plans but never follow through.I let some of my friends to take advantage of me as I rarely stand up for myself.I have done a lot of drugs to hide the pain and forget about my mistakes and regrets.The only time I am honest is when I am drunk or high Except right now I guess which is weird...I do have dreams and aspirations though but I set myself such high standards that It makes me paralyzed.No matter how many selfhelp books I read or selfreflection I do I am still unable to ask for help.

705,I believe that I am just a fat useless worthless autistic loser. My whole life was a disaster from childhood up to now. I was bullied my whole life eventually online for 3 years as well. I was not the best kid either because I was immature and had a temper which I still do. In college nobody liked me because I was different due to my autism. Same with 2 High School bands and every job I had. So basically I was hated my entire life. there is no point in me having a career in anything either because nobody will ever hire me so there is no point in trying. I truly believe that I deserve to die what is the point?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

725,Fuck this world fuck 99 of the people in it let us hope everything burns and falls apart because this bullshit notion that there is kindness and quality is absolute horseshit.I am tired of people say be kind and the universe will reciprocate none of that is true you have to be a terrible person who does terrible things in order to get ahead. Forget about being a quality human being there never was such a thing. People need to start doing negative actions in order to rectify all the wrongs going on. You are not in control of anything and instead are just a pawn in a bullshit mirage of happiness. There is no point in helping anyone there is no point in doing anything positive except for animals who cannot help themselves. People are fucking disgusting and I have zero empathy or sympathy for any being anymore. Millions suffer from depression and sadness and nothing is changing. In order to change anything be a nasty person and take what you can because that is how happy people live. Be evil like a Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates lie about having a good exterior and ravage everything you can because nothing good comes from being a good person. Drop the anxiety ravage what you can this place is a dump for anger and terror. The time for empathy is gone fuck this world and fuck anyone who says you have to fight for goodness. There is no goodness only shit people saying shitty things. Fuck money fuck owning a home fuck going to the movies fuck listening to music fuck an education fuck helpless people because there is no helping them. Fuck it all and I hope the world burns today not tomorrow not next week fucking burn today. Fuck being good or kind its all a mirage.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
726,I always read that telling people you trust is the best option for getting help but it just feels meaningless when they tell me I should think about my future and how I should fight for my life when I am suicidal. Literally all I see for my future is suicide and if not then unemployed pathetic still relying on my parents etc. I feel like a baby that is not trying and I am convinced that I really am just lazy and not trying but why should I when I see no point in it. I plan to kill myself soon anyways. None of it will matter. You just get mad and insult or laugh at me when I tell you that so I will not and your eyes are always filled with judgement. I do not get why you do not want to tell me to kill myself instead of going through the struggle of telling me why I should not Telling me to fight for my life will not work since I am suicidal,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
727,I have not been able to sleep because I have been constantly crying. Heck I am still fucking crying. Just last night me and my sister finally spoke up against my mother. My mothers always been putting us down and telling us about how much she is sacrificed for us and I know I am supposed to feel grateful but the way she says it makes me feel like I am a financial burden and all this degrading has like internalized into a deep self hatred over the past 15 years. I had just graduated college and honestly I really cannot afford to live on my own because of my health conditions and that my state is very costly to live in. I would not be able to afford living on my own unless I risk my health and risk losing my dream of being able to do art. My hands will not be usable if I had to work 2 or more minimum wage jobs. And last night was just the final straw. I am so fucking sick of the same fucking shit and its like nothing I do enough is good enough to satisfy her. Oh you got good grades? Well my coworkers daughter was valid Victorian. Oh you are studying art? Well its not going to get you work and I know my coworkers daughters who are nurses now and make so much money. I just want to have some even if its just a little validation like maybe a good job or something but all I get is 15 years of self hatred a loss of my will to live. I swear the only few reasons I am still around are just personal projects obligations to hang out with people and the fear of death but at this point idk if I can take this shit much longer. I just want someone to tell me that I am not a failure. Is that too much to ask? I feel like no matter what I do its never good enough and if I want to do something Id end up where I started,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
728,I would be preaching to the choir if I explained how much pain I feel or how bleak things are. Can anybody share some quick tips on why I should stay alive or how I can? I do not think life is worth it and my mind is just mangled How can I keep living?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
731,Well me I am not that type person to talk abt my feelings just thought that maybe there will be some one who can understand what I mean actually its really hard to explain I feel like that is why I cannot get any help I just want to die but I am so scared to die because I do not know what is next what is after this world were in Rn I am just so lonely have nobody to talk to i have no friends and everything else its just so heavy I am only 14 I do not really know if I am supposed to be having these thoughts I have a lot more to say but I am sleepy lol goodnight Sad,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
735,I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes and other errors i will probably make.Well the post title is just that living is fun and all sometimes but i just cannot handle it anymore. No matter what i try i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father the occasional kick or punch i can deal with but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it eating it or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah she was a friend of my GF and me at the time and when shit hit the fan she was there for me i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a jobIt would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself That still sticks with me today i think about it every single time i get closer to someone every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore every single day seems to get worse and worse. And there is nothing i can do about it.I am sorry if you read this you should not have but i just needed somewhere to write this downI just do not want all this fucking baggage Sometimes i just do not want to live anymore or atleast not as myself.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
737,Finally fucking did it. 20 years old almost a millionaire in liquid cash assets passive income of 5 figures monthly bought my parents a home in cash as gift why the fuck am I not happy?I do not fucking understand I always wanted this I always worked for it now I have it and my brain still tells me to fucking die.I cannot possibly explain this and I am aware of how stupid it sounds but I cannot help it.I avoid mirrors just so I do not have to look at myself. My brain cannot be helped. Anything good I do it tells me its worthless because I could have done it sooner but now its too late.Become wealthy? you are 20 should have achieved that at max 18.Create beautiful successful projects? Meh there are teens building the future since they are 12 you are too late.Anything I do its not good enough.I do not expect kind comments or any comments at all I just wanted to pour my soul out to somebody.I am hanging by a thread and nobody sees it. I finally fucking did it but I still feel the need to die,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
739,I feel done. I think I am done.Nothing seems exciting it feels like the world has lost color. I do not know why I am here. I have a job and according to my friends that would make me feel better.I am done I am done taking up space I am done feeling like I am too much. I do not want to be here anymore Done,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
741,This year things seemed to be doing good finally got on t and mood started to stabilize to the point where I was not having meltdowns in broom closets at work dailyNow into the summer it comes backYear before this was in inpatient because I was hearing shit that was not there and decided to hospitalize myself because it was making me suicidal Year before that was out on leave for 4 months again around the same time of year late summerlate November that time because my doctor upped the dosage of a medication that fucked up my mood dissorder severelyYear before that was because I was suicidal was pre t hospital staff threatened to tackle me if I did not remove my chest flattening garment and kept me in a hallway full of strangers and misgendered me the entire time had a meltdown in front of said strangers who began to openly mocked me. I cannot afford to keep hospitalizing myself and if I try to just go back to my job I am going to end up killing myself there is nearly a 100 foot drop from the balcony to the floor in the building I am working in I have thought about it I have never gone too far but have had attempts through other means. it is going to be complaining and saying hey something is wrong and I need actual financial support and therapy from someone trained to handle trauma in a way that is not just telling me I have anxiety and that what is going on is normal I need help or I am going to die and no one will take me seriously until it actually happens. The only reason I am not dead now is because the thought of people going wow we had no idea this would happen makes me physically ill. cannot fucking do this shit anymore always back to square one,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
746,I still live with my parents and I want to change my major. I am very unhappy with the major i chose. My mom says its too late now and that i must graduate and find a job. I have not given up so I am studying to a very important exam to get accepted in a new major but its so hard to study the whole day and not flunk in the classes that I take in college. I do not have much free time at all.I do not haven many friends never dated. I am too socially awkward. I gained 10kg in the quarantine. I feel that I am ugly now and that I will die alone and unhappy. Sometimes I think about dying and just wish I was never born. I am 22 and have gotten nowhere.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
747,I do not get it. I do not get why i feel this way. I have a mom who loves me and who i love to death a dad that cares about me. A sibling who looks up to me. I am 15 I have been going to therapy since last year.She said i got better she said my aura had changed she said i seem happier and that was true for some time but now i do not even know. I do good in school i have 3 friends who love me. Who i told that i hate myself. I am a white middle class girl who lives in a safe town. But yet i find my self crying for no reason. I find myself feeling numb and on the verge of breakdowns when hanging out with friends. I am terrified of death yet I want him to take my hand sooner than he has planned. I lay in bed and stare at my room that my mom begs for me to clean so desperately. She begs me to come downstairs and hangout with her yet i cannot and i feel so guilty for not doing so. My dad cried once because he realized he was too hard on me. I do not eat as much as i used to a toddler could eat more than me in a day. The clothes on my back get changed when i take a shower which is a disgusting amount of days to some people. I read books wishing i was the main character i would not have to worry about getting a shitty job that i hate just so i can become another employee to this company we call the you.S. The Earth is dying and there is nothing i can do about it. I want to live life to the fullest before the end but i cannot find myself having the energy or the funds to do so. I do not see a point to life the only thing stopping me is my mom walking in on my dead body. I cannot see my life being worth it in the long run I cannot see the money my parents spend to feed and attempt to give me joy worth it. I do not get it i really do not get it i do not get why i have mascara stained cheeks right now. i do not get why two people decided to have sex one day. I do not get why I am drowning in my own misery while people have it worse. I remember in school we asked the question if a character in the book was weak or not for committing sucide. Every single person said weak. I do not see myself as a weak person and i do not think anyone who thinks about ending it is weak. I just think they want peace and they are tired. I am tired. Those few minutes of happiness a day are not worth the amount of dread i feel a week. I am young yet I am already exhausted,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
748,I hate everything about my life. I hate my job and nothing makes me happy anymore. I am ready to go. Just cannot find the courage. I think I am done.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
749,I keep showing a happy face to everyone but in reality all I want in my life is to not have a life anymore. I do not want to kill myself I just want to die somehow painless... Does anyone else feels like that too? Will I ever stop waiting for my death to come?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
751,it is been a rough year for everyone. I thought I was starting to bounce back a few weeks ago when I broke up with my boyfriend because it felt like a weight was lifted off my chest. I had more energy I started actually texting people back I started tackling my enormous workload that had piled up and I made plans with friends.But then 2 weeks ago I got nearly blackout drunk at a house party because the guy I started casually sleeping with brought a different girl to the party. It just made me feel so worthless and shit so I drank way too much picked a fight with a friend then walked home and made a shitty weak suicide attempt. The number of pills I swallowed was nowhere near enough to actually kill me but it was definitely enough to keep me vomiting for the next 36 hours.I came back to work after taking a sick day and was immediately overwhelmed with timesensitive critical tasks that came out of nowhere. Then Thursday night my cat got sick and spent 2 nights at the emergency vet hospital. She might have cancer but at least she is back home now and seeming better.I am at work right now staring at the list of shit I have to do that is too long too full of overdue stuff that I will never have time to do and I just cannot fucking engage. I have been in this job for 2 years now and I want some career growth but I do not have the time or energy to apply to stuff. I missed out on applying to a really great opportunity because I was puking my guts out when the deadline passed.I just feel like I will never reach that surface. Nothing will ever get better I will never grow and be more successful I will never be able to maintain relationships I will never be able to lead a good life.I just want to fucking die but I cannot seem to figure out a good suicide method. I feel like I keep trying to swim up to the surface but my legs are caught in seaweed,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
752,Before I explain why I am about to end my life I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now as for why I am going to commit suicide there are two reasons My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group I never felt like I clicked with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried I always felt different from other people and not in a good way. If others were to describe me they would probably say that I was weird or odd but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections despite being in my midtwenties I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah I know you are probably laughing at me right now but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it but really it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members but as fucked up as it sounds not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others I cannot function as an adult in society and if I cannot function in society then I might as well clock out. Additionally I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot stab or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population and while true I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title Homeowner shoots robbers in home invasion or something like that then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for selfdefense do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios selfdefense is necessary but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article and surprise surprise people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well I do not distrust all of humanity and I believe that this subreddit may have likeminded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do you will regret it.

753,I have left everyone and isolated myself in my room. I cannot feel satisfied or even excited about anything I simply do not care anymore. I do not want to get help because I do not think it will work I feel miserable and hopeless. I do not see myself living,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
755,I do not want to try anymore. there is no place on this earth where I want to exist and I really wish my last asthma attack just took me out because everything has felt pointless since then. I am tired,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
756,I feel so misunderstood by my family like they judge me constantly think negative things about me but are holding back and telling me how to live and watching how I do claiming to love me as a family but not socializing with me not anything.I do not have any friends left.Whenever I interact with people now I tend to overshare when they actually ask how I am and actually want to know. And obviously this drives people away. So am I supposed to just keep all this to myself?I have tried those hotlines good Samaritan emails they do not help... I always feel talked down to or like they do not actually care or I am holding them up and it just does not help.I am at the end of my rope and am thinking of numbing myself out with anti depressants and anti anxieties now to just be able to stay alive and not be a bother to anyone. I do not fit in with my family and have no friends where do I go for support?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
758,I hate my life I feel no good emotions just painpain and more pain. My life is just endless suffering every single day. it is not fair I have no reason to stay alive,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
769,I have tried really hard to stick it out and be positive. But I feel like the universe has given up on me. And it never felt like there was anyone for me anyways. So maybe all of this is a sign that this is it. I do not need to keep fighting and holding on any longer. I can finally rest and be at peace. I do not need to swim against the current. Just let it take me wherever as long as I do not have to feel again.I am so tired. I do not need to keep going. I am broken and I want to say goodbye to anyone who will listen,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
777,i am supposed to be doing better but thoughts of ending my life still plague my everyday existence. i truly believe that my death would relieve so many people of burden and immense potential pain. how do i stop imagining this escape and stop feeling this way? how do you deal with suicidal ideations?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
779,After years and years of people's bullshit I have just became a bitter and closed off person compared to when I was a kid. Constant bullying constantly being ignored or belittled constantly being seen as not important stuff like this make me really despise everyone I meet. Usually people say I am grumpy or I have anger issues. They usually say I need to be a happier person and be nice to others. Well to them MASSIVE FUCK YOU . I am tired of constantly being the lighting rod of being looked down up and seen as a bad person when I am reality all I get is nothing but negative comments like racist or sexist slurs towards me or not supporting a belief or having doubts on an opinion. Yet they expect me to roll with the punches and shut up. I should give happiness to others when all I get is mental abuse and insults. that is why I despise happiness. I cannot bare to see someone happy because it reminds me of how selfish people can be. Even people who accomplished something makes me feel like shit because it feels like they are flexing the accomplishment when I am miles from them. Yet they expect me to cheer on the sidelines. It saddens me alot to see people in relationships or get opportunities while it feels like my life is on fucking repeat by eating and shitting. And if anything goes wrong it is always my fucking fault. Dog hurt there paw? My fault. someone is tire gets flat my fault. Someone is about to be robbed? Well guess who is fucking fault it is. I do not even need to be involved and somehow everyone loves to put the blame on me. All these traits that people reflected onto me just make me wish for suicide sometimes. But I am too much of a pussy to do that. Instead I just reside to my own thoughts and being my own parent and comfort myself that others failed to show. that is why I hate being happy and that is why I refuse to give happiness to others when over the years all I got was hate and bullshit and disloyalty. I hate being happy and I despise giving happiness to others,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
780,I do not know when it will be. Maybe at the end of the year maybe in ten years. All I know is that I am worthless to everyone and I am worthless to myself. I cannot keep this charade going forever. I do not plan on it any time soon but I know that is the way it will end. I hate myself. I have even thought I want to have a disease take me already but I am actually terrified of dying. I just want to be loved. that is all I want now. I have loved deeply and I have been shown I do not mean anything to everyone I have met. I just want people to care and love me the way i love people. I do not love myself anymore. I do not even want to. I am such a fucking loser. Despite all the shit I think about myself I know I am kind hearted person. I care for people. I just want people to care but I am not worth anyone's time. Despite all my efforts I am unlovable. I have accepted that one day I will just kill myself,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
781,For starters I am a skinny female with barely any curves narrow hips small boobs thigh gap small butt and just nothing exciting to look at. Yea my face is fine but you would be surprised how much a persons body is important. I tried putting on weight but its very difficult. VERY difficult. I just want to be accepted. It hurts so bad knowing most men only prefer curvy women which i totally understand i wish I could have their bodies. I am really praying my metabolism slows I just went to be a normal weight. Even to gain a simple pound Id have to eat 3500 calories and even that is a lot of good everyday. At least for meI truly think my body is cursed My body makes me harm myself,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
783,No really? Why have we have a species survived this long? I do not get how people can just live like this without killing themselves. I feel like my family therapist etc. think I am crazy every time I bring it up.I do not want to have a job and I do not see why everyone collectively agreed that wasting your entire week doing mind numbing bullshit that you hate was any way to live. I ended up quitting my last job after a few days. Just walked out on my lunch and never came back because I could not stop myself from crying. I get exhausted so easily and cannot really do much for more than a few hours without feeling like I am going to pass out and it is so frustrating. I was taking caffeine pills to keep me awake at work but they did not do shit. Maybe it is a medical thing or because I am autistic or maybe I am just fucking lazy. I dunno but whatever it is it made me sleep for 16 hours straight after returning from my first shift. I tried to kill myself the night after my second one. I kind of wish I actually wanted to die. I used to when I was younger but I did not really have any means of doing it. Eventually I taught myself to find things worth sticking around for no matter how small they are. But it backfired because I feel like I have no choice but to kill myself because I was born into a world I am not cut out for. Now the things that previously were keeping me here are just things I have no choice but to leave behind and it hurts more than if there was just nothing. Does that make sense? No? let us move onI am stuck relying on my parents for the time being which I hate because I know they just see me as a leech. They try to sugarcoat it but it is obvious that my dad resents me and I am just waiting for the point where he cuts me off financially because I know it is inevitable especially due to the fact that I am trans and closeted and they are both farright wackjobs who are a few Facebook links away from thinking the Earth is flat.So having any long term goals or aspirations seems really pointless knowing everything can all get sucked out from underneath me the instant they find out.Ok I am tired of typing now. going to go pass out. what is the point?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
785,The Earth is fucked. Climate change is just going to get worse and at this point I cannot do anything about it. The corporations and billionaires are just going to keep exploiting and raping the world of all of its treasures and natural beauties. I do not want to live in a world that is on its death bed. what is the point of going to college right now when I am not going to get a good job anyways. I may as well drop out and get a shit job because that is what Ill end up with no matter what. would not it be better if I just killed myself and rid the world of one less wasteful person? Population is an issue anyways. I do not want to work my entire life never being able to retire. I fucking hate that I am addicted to my phone because its one of the only things I can occupy myself with without cutting myself to shreds. I became an adult last year and all I wish I could do is either die or go back to the ignorance and bliss of childhood. I want to be a happy idiot instead of a sad one. All that would make me happy is for me to live in the woods away from all people until I starve. I used to want to study film in school and now that I am all I want to do is quit. There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together. It does not even mean much because I am a fucking film student. I am wasting my time with a major that is a scam. The only issue is that there is nothing else in the world that I would study. I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself. I do not even have the balls for that. I think about it every day but I am not brave enough to do it. I may even join the military and hope that I can die. Everything is fucked,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

789,This is not living let alone life. I am in constant pain every single fucking day. I even tried to do something fun tonight by myself only to end up having a sciatic episode and now I can barely walk yet once again without being in pain. I have been to the chiropractor several times and I thought after a year of going I would be fine until this shit happens yet again. I am so fucking tired of trying to make something of myself and yet people not watching my content or even cheering me the fuck on at all. I have been writing and making content for fucking almost 10 years and people do not give a shit. I do not have really any friends that give a damn all that much cept one that I barely see. I am so tired of people not giving a fuck about my or making zero effort to be in my life. After losing my mom at 14 being lied to about being a father for a few years being physically abused losing basically the rest of my family on top of every thing else I am done man. I cannot take this shit anymore. I am tired of fake ass people that only want something from me because I get tons of free shit. I am so damn tired of people only caring when it benefits them. I am tired of being fucking trolled online by people and even some people on here that stalk me and just downvote my shit. I am tired of having mental illness and barely anyone giving a shit. do not fucking come to my funeral when I am dead and pretend like I cared. do not cry at my lifeless body with your fake ass I wish I did this or that bullshit. Fucking love me now while I am alive and not wait till I am gone forever. I am so damn tired of this thing called life,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
792,First off I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18 I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance 250 fee and then to the hospital got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd July 2nd I was on a multiday alcohol bender and attempted pills. Cops showed up and I was not compliant kept telling them to leave me alone and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs. They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said you just touched my dick again and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said because you told us to fuck off like 20 times and we are doing what is your best interest. Riiight not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100 illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it shit food a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors social workers are there but rarely see you saw mine on the 5th day was supposed to be every day and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 510 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure well just let us know if you have a seizure and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said you are not going through withdrawals it is a benzodiazepine it is the same thing. I was crying I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo WDs feel you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing felt like my back and neck were about to snap was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said if you flop on the floor like that I am not going to give you any benzos.The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile a violent methhead a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day a couple fucking violence between patients and securitypolice emergency calls etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor because my psych forgot to see me one morning and he was more or less like what the fuck are they doing?. I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward even voluntarily,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
793,So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21yearold black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer. I do not think I can Last straw,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
801,I am not going to tell people when I am like this because I am always like this. I am slowly going to withdraw and then I can go and it will be okay. Idk if this is a sad or happy thing but I know that people will move on. Like maybe it will hurt. But they will move on. And I will finally be free. I am on a mission to stop being a burden,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
803,My MI was getting worse and I lost my job because I had to take too many days off. Then I fell into a pit of depression for a month. I thought if I found a new job I would feel better. I got a job and after a day and a half I had to leave. I could not do it. I was a trembling sweaty mess from anxiety and my concentration was shattered. The whole day and a half I was using every trick I know to stay sane and nothing was sticking. I was totally overwhelmed. Now I do not know what I am going to do. I know society at large wants me to contribute to capitalism or die trying. But the few people who love me do not deserve to be hurt like that. I really want to kill myself and get it over with but I have tried and it is harder than it looks. I do not have a gun. But I do not have any other solution either. Burden people while living or hurt them by dying. This world is a fucked up place. depression and jobs,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
806,Really. I always thought this to an extent. But now the one friend I was closest to for years and I supported for years just let us me rot and could not care less how I am feeling or if I died. I am sure this friend will cry and play victim when I die. I never saw this coming and this just confirms that most people are shit. I am still in shock and I am full of hate for this person now. I know that is not serving me anything good but the last 3 years have been so fucking SHIT and I have met so many people who have fucked me over and showed me they do not care about me when I thought they did and when I did care about them. I am so done.Maybe it is fucking cheesy and pathetic but these lyrics speak so much to me nowDo I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? Fuck people,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
809,I am not looking for peoples to wish me an happy birthday I want to say that sometimes life is worth living i wanted to end it all at 20 but here iam it takes time before something bright happen but it will eventually happen I wish everybody the best and if you need to talk I am here for you take care guys I made it to 21 yo,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
811,My life sucks and I cannot imagine it changing for the better. I hate where I live I do not feel welcome here. My family look at me like I am a burden they need to get rid of. I do not know what I am doing with my life I do not have money and I do not know what I am doing with work and school. I feel like I am a waste of space who is never going to accomplish anything. I just want things to be different I do not want to be here anymore Feeling like there is no way out,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
816,I say I do not care but then why do I care if people worry? that is only reason why I have not harmed myself externally I just do not want to worry people.I have said this to many friends but if i where to die Id like to be alone so I could be dead knowing that no one knows I am gone and know one worrys. I only feel like I exist to want the companionship of a relationship.Why does it feel like everyone is watching me judging me being disappointed in me?Expressing my thoughts and feelings seem to hurt people and push them away.. so I should not express anything and keep hiding behind my fake smile? I guess I should because if not then id worry people. I do not understand myself,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
817,I cannot even be productive when it is my life on the line. I just want to be dead but I am too scared. I know there is nothing in this life for me and I am so over feeling bad for myself it is honestly funny. I am just too weak and worthless and alone to survive all of this bullshit. I do not know how to fix this I do not even see how fixing it would be worth it. Everyone I know is depressed and I am the only one who is too weak to handle it,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

821,Hi I know that probably nobody is interested in listening to this but I am trying anyways because I have nothing to lose already.I am stuck on a life that seems to not get any better.I lost one of my best friends because of a bad decision that cannot be retracted I am stuck on a job which I do not see myself getting out of. And worst of all I feel that everyday I am losing who I am and I just need to get this pain out just feel a bit of enjoy on my life. I am tired of fighting for what I think is right caring for other looking for friends searching for the good for everyone even me. This has only brought on me pain and dread I cannot be the person that I wanted to be and that makes me empty. I do not feel to be a bad person I cannot ignore other people's emotions and if I am made fun of it I am being called fucking stupid for it for everyone I know maybe its that I am not made to be in this world. Sorry for being this negative on this text and for my bad english and grammar but I am so lost and with a little of bravery I am going to attemp to kill myself.Thanks for reading this if you reached to the end of this. I am on the verge of ending it all,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

I feel so pathetic so helpless. I have no relief. I drive for hours and hours with no destination. I cannot focus at work I hate everyone in the same city that she is in. I cannot live without her. I do not know how to continue on. My therapist told me I need to lean into this and deal with the pain as it comes. It is unbearable I feel like I am drowning. I cannot Live Without Her,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
825,I tried to be strong physically and mentally. I had hope lots of it. But after years of nothing happy and good happening. Why would I keep going? Its only right for me to commit suicide. ThTs what they want the universe? God? The creator. God teases and bullys me. He let us the devil have me. So if that is what is supposed to happene why would I keep allowing myself to suffer? I had big dreams and goals I was a happy kid genuinely nice but the world has changed me. For the first time I need toe be honest with myself. I want to die. And I do not see anything happy in my future. After all the hope and let downs I have had I would be a fool to keep going and allowing the world to continue to beat me. If someone seees this I just want you to know I tried. I truly did put up a fight. But sadly as always I did not come out victorious. My family does not deserve this. I at least wanted to live for them. But we do not always get what we want and I want to go. I hate that it cameTo this but I am so sad and tired. I am at my limit and I cannot tAke it anymore.

And that is an understatement. I feel like everyone hates me and I am so so fucking lonely. I cannot do anything right. I am a failure disappointment and a let down to my family. I ruin everything I touch or go near.I am in financial problems and cannot find a way out. My mental health has never been so bad. And there is no one I can talk to no one who will help. Everything is too much. I do not want to be here anymore but cannot leave. I wish I never existed everyone would be better off that way. I am toxic. I hate myself.

841,So awhile ago my friend tried to kill himself with a bullet to the brain and hes since made a full recovery. I have not seen him since it happened but people say hes different. I am absolutely terrified of seeing him again I do not know why but there is a pit in my stomach. I do not know what they mean when they say different. Can someone please help? Its causing me a lot of feelings . I feel horrible for not wanting to see him . I am going to try and see him but I have no idea why I am scared. My friend tried to kill himself,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
843,I am 19 M Its 6am and I have work soon. I cannot sleep and I have not but this is not like me. I have been up all night with the same thoughts running through my mind you should kill yourself who cares how you feel its not like you are important shut up shut the fuck up and stop being a bitch I do not know what to do anymore. Every day feels the same and nothing gets better. I have felt this way since I was in 7th grade and now its to a point where I genuinely do not think I am worth anything. I feel so broken and lost all I can do is cry and think of how terrible I am. Its every day these thoughts of hating myself run on replay in my mind. I have no emotional support from my family or friends and I cannot afford therapy. This shit hurts so bad and I cannot tell if I am actually depressed or just full of self pity. Oh my god it hurts so much and I cannot get out of this hole. I know I am better than this and can overcome it. If you met me in person you would have no idea I felt this way. This probably sounds the same as every other person who is reached out for help on Reddit but all I think about is how much better off I would be dead and its not how I want to be. Could somebody please help me see the light and how much better things could be. I feel nothing but emotional pain and always hate myself for any small thing I do. I just want to overcome this and not end up taking my own life. I really need someone right now,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
851,I wake up everyday without a purpose or anything to do. I have no one texting me no one to talk to my age. I have literally zero friends and all I see is people having good times with friends online and it makes me cry. They say these are the best years of your life and if that is the case then what is the point of trying to go on. I doubt this will get any eyes but I wish everyone a blessed future and I hope no one has to go through the same issues I am going through. I feel like I do not exist,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
857,My mother passed February 22 2021. I woke up to a phone call from my father who found her. I have not been the same since. I get up and go to work with a smile on my face but its all fake as fuck. I want to crawl in a hole in die. My wife has been amazing but I am not an emotionally in tune person face to face. Its hard to clean my house and do my laundry. Some days its hard to even want to live. My mother was not the greatest mom in the world but I was always a mommas boy. My mom died in February and I have not been the same.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
860,Last year I went into a relationship I do not really trust anyone to heart too fast so it took a long time to trust. And when I did trust her she dumped me... I felt horrible and she never gave an answer why she dumped me. I recently met this girl and she was so sweet and caring so I trusted her too fast with my heart... she cheated in front of me with no mercy at all. This happened yesterday and I am just feeling that lifes not worth it anymore... I have been bullied for a long time and I have big insecurities should I really live any more?

861,TW disordered eatingsuicidal ideation I do not know why I have lost all motivation to do anything either I am eating too much or too little. I am constipated as fuck. I am tired and slept for 9 hours. do not even have the motivation to cook anything so I had to order shit to the apartment I live in. I am poor and cannot hold a job for more than a month without all of the stresses building up until I break down. Makes me feel like I am acting like an entitled piece of shit who is making excuses not to work or something but I have tried the approach of just sucking up the stress and hoping it will disappear does not work like that. Parent pressured me to move out by screaming at me constantly and telling me that Ill never amount to anything in life and how I am toxic and judged me over my every move. Never really felt good enough think about killing myself but that is too much effort. Tried therapy did not work. Tried medical marijuana developed scary hallucinations. I do not know what I am doing in life I am just existing and am likely to end up out on the street likely to become a drug addict because I am nothing but a bother to people. Thinking of running away but again that is literally too much. I do not want to be here. I feel worthless,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
862,Santa Claus. God. Good people. The government cares about its citizens. The military treats its troops with respect instead of using them as a means to an end. Careers exist. College matters. Doctors will not lie to you to make money. We are an advanced species and do not resort to tribal ape behavior and thinking like the 'animals'. Lies. All lies. Everyday I am lied to. what is the point of keeping on when everything you believed in is lies?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
863,I have had anxiety depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the comorbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety agoraphobia body dysmorphic disorder as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have CPTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and CPTSD which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawingart video blog as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multiskilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as videomaking skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sht,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

913,Because all my friends are either busy or also depressed and even suicidal like me. Because no one understands and that makes me resent them more.Because they do not know how to help which only makes me feel worse.Because they turn it around and make it about themselves.This is too much for anyone untrained to deal with not even therapists do much to help and I really hate feeling like a burden and frustrating people. I hate feeling selfish. I am still just waiting to die. My physical health keeps worsening so perhaps I can bet on that. Why do not you reach out to someone?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
915,This past year and a half have been absolutely terrible for me. I went into college with hope and excitement to finally start my life only to be kept in my dorm room the entire time and have almost no college experience. Last fall I became depressed and my grades dropped dramatically but over the winter I got back into school and really brought my grades up. Only to hear on the week of finals that my brother in the Navy who I had not seen for over two years passed away. This led to me ultimately failing one of my required classes that I failed in the fall. Over this summer I worked at appealing my scholarship and taking classes to help boost my GPA. But because my family's expected family contribution was slightly too high I could not receive the scholarship I desperately need to afford school. The school has not given me any aid or support and my parents cannot take out a loan. I am having a really difficult time coping with this and I am having thoughts of considering to just end it. I worked so hard and Covid took so much away from me. I am terrified of even trying to start over because I am afraid I will lose something or someone else important to me. Thanks for reading this.

925,I do not know why but I can kill myself even if I want to die and I really want to hurt myself.I hate me a lot and I want me to suffer but even when I cut myself I do it where it cannot really harm myself where it is just a bit of pain and distracts me for a moment from other thoughts.I guess I prefer to die more naturally like in a car accident or from illness.the best way to die for me would be doing some heroic shit like saving someone from a car crash or a fire I would be proud of myself for a moment at least and hopefully it would hurt less to my family and friends if I die doing something good instead of killing me to stop this suffer.

933,The last few months have been okay for me. I have gone to therapy and it is given me ways to cope with most of my depressive thoughts at least the ones caused by obvious thoughts process. Last night I had a dream that made me depressed. I remember running away from people all around me laughing at me as I just tried to get away from them so I could find a space to crawl into and curl up. Once I woke up this sense of worthlessness still stuck around but I could not find any of the thought processes that I know how to combat now. I just felt like an awful human for no reason.And then I imagined what it would be like if I was in a country with easy access to handguns and if I had one myself. It suddenly felt very easy to imagine myself loading it and holding it to my skull. The decision to pull the trigger feels like it would be so easy and yet I do not understand why. I am in a better place than I was last year. I feel fairly free and OK with life where as back then I was planning out the finer details of how to take my own life and yet that idea of dying still feels like the only way I am going to get away from these thoughts completely.Is that my reality now? Having to occasional fight the urge to end it all for no particular reason? Why does the decision to end it feel so easy?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

970,Have you guys seen the news recently. does not look like the futures going to be good. Time to call it quits? Everyday the world is looking worse. what is the point anymore,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
971,To start I am here because of relationship anxiety. I had posted recently about having immense anxiety about a girl I barely knew. Awesome girl. Very grounded very sweet. But for some odd reason chemistry somewhere down the way I had become infatuated rather quick. And then a certain unease crept in that felt like I was screwing up somewhere. within moments I automatically jumped to very negative affirmations that swirled in my head day and night for the past two weeks. The ones that stick out you are going to fuck this up you are not normal she will find out your issues and dip from yo crazy ass!!Somewhere down the way I deeply pondered at the last part. Life looking back was rather well....Childhood!!I had parents who had issues in their relationship on their own let own their own individual demons. I acknowledge that they always did their best to make sure we were fed and had a roof over our heads. But a lot of things I felt I had to teach myself on my own. In the beginning life was okay but after awhile it got tough for my parents way back. and certain choices were made then that led to exodus from Hawaii to the mainland. Things were the best we could make but they were not ideal. At some point in time we slept in a car as a family.We never stayed in one place for longer than a year. always constantly moving since I was a kid it practically never ended until I had gotten a place of my own. It did not with my parents anger issues mother's narcissism and my father's drinking and abuse. Still through it all they stuck it out for us but I wonder sometimes if that was a good idea...When both of my younger siblings were diagnosed with autism both of my parents had gotten distant from me it felt. I completely understand and a lot of it I give myself shit for it. But also my younger siblings have been sheltered too much as well. It was hard then as a kid to tell them that there was a difference between compromising and spoiling. We gave them no structure or guidance. After awhile I was left with most of responsibilities of watching and raising my younger siblings which are the memories I enjoy most in my life. Looking back now it was not all bad.The level of abuse between my parents ruined a lot of opportunities for us. Always hurting themselves us our possessions fighting relocating separating getting back together again rinse and repeat. Lived through toxic before I knew what that meant. Ran away for the first time when I was 11 and went across the county almost. It became clockwork. because of the constant moving I could never maintain friendships. And on top of that I was scared to bring friends around. To some degree it got to a point where we filed a false domestic violence report on my father He actually was getting his shit together at the time to get into a farm program and avoid sleeping on the street. Also a good time learned Martial arts did gardening. Another good time.Parents had gotten back together at some point in time before High School. Life was good for a bit stable. Then the issues arose. I was having issues with my parents then and went out and hung out with the wrong crowd was partying and drinking all the time even skipping school. I graduated but barely. My graduation on the other hand was finding out my mother was gambling addict and also was in part to ruining a lot of our prospects in life.I do not want to hold onto any of this against my parents. Now they are still trying their best to survive and they have changed over the years. But lately this surfaced too and I have not felt well when I talked to my mother about this. She did not know what to say and I began to be frustrated about it but I realize now that she was not prepared to handle the issues I was going through and she was trying her best. Its still upsetting when she does not remember anything she has done wrong. But I need to move on I love my mother and I only have one. No matter how batshit crazy she is.I love my dad we are okay we hang out have lunch every once in awhile and he is conscious of his actions. But he still has a lot of work to do. But I am proud of how far he is come. I love you Dad.Adulthood!!! the super condensed versionRight after graduation was a shitshow. Lost the place me and pops split. ended up in a shelter for a year and a half. Dad came here from a different country under extreme circumstances I do not want to get into but frankly he was prepared for life as much as I was. Went to community college while homeless. Got an apartment with other guys my age from the shelter. Then realized alcoholism was genetic. Fucked off my responsibilities. Split. Went upstate to stay with my mother. At the time I realized she was up to same tricks which led to a lot of fights between us and eventually she stole from me and kicked me out. stayed with a girl next door first relationship then left me for the father of her baby I was still fucking off my responsibilities then and subsequently back on the street.moved around from place to place. Met another girl fell in love but she had major depressive disorder and schizo. after a year the relationship took a turn for the worst. She began to be emotionally abusive and always kicked me out. I did my best but at the end of the day we have come to terms that she never actually loved me. She went into another relationship a couple weeks later. But I fell hard.Interesting part COVIDI moved back the other side of the state to stay with my dad. The place he had for me was a clean and sober house ran by a slumlord. Then COVID hit the states. I was quarantined in a horrible place post breakup living with my dad who was emotionally abusive. I could not handle it. I got my shit together got a job at the hospital and got my own apartment!!!NOW....Been doing everything I needed to. Kept up with bills work out every day eating healthy drinking less. Then I met this girl. Same birthday independent very grounded. And now everything came back. Now my anxiety is becoming debilitating in certain areas. I am becoming more irritable although a lot of that is from the shortcomings of the healthcare industry. But if this is going to become a thing I need in dealing with this anxious attachment style. I have pushed away my remaining friends because of my last relationship and I am starting to push everyone else away right now. Either way if you made this far thanks for taking the time. I know I am better than this and I know I can be better than this. I just wish I did not mess this up with her just to learn. Frankly I just wish things like this did not happen just for a learning lesson. Feels like the purpose of my life is just to be an example. do not be like this guy. I just want to be happy and honest. I try to do the right thing in anything I do and I try to help people as much as I can. But why I cannot be happy or trust other people? Why cannot I just be happy?Wishing I could time travel now.....ampx200BTry your best because everything else is easy. Always do the right thing. Goodwill will always be paid forward.

973,I do not hate being alive. I just hate living. I feel like I cannot do anything right no matter how hard I try. I tend to mess something up in one way or another and I am just trying to survive. I drive my car trying to get from one point to another in a rural area with no public transportations my car breaks.I drive my dads truck and it rains living in a hilly spot the traction control comes on and now the tires smell and have a white smoke coming from them even after the traction control disengaged.I had to grocery shop and I was just trying to get the usual. I got pickles and then putting them in the truck something broke so now there pickle juice all over a 50lb bag of salts that is for our cows. Of course the bag was paper so the juice leaked through. And of course trying to get the giant box of cat little out of this truck I am not used to I smacked my lip and busted it open. These were just my blunders from this morning. The list goes onIm just tired of doing stuff. Everything I do something bad things keeps happening and I am tired of feeling like a burden I waste money I break stuff. And all I am trying to do is live with the same knowledge that was given to my peers. I wish I could just some doing thing and making decisions and have everything done for me. Then I could do nothing wrong. Fuck my lip hurts. I hate having to live.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
974,At the age of 23 I am a 57 male. My dad is taller than me and my younger brothers are taller than me at 510 and 59. Everywhere I look on the internet or even just regular conversations people seem to be OBSESSED with height. Any short male is deemed as a joke these days and I cannot take it anymore.I do not even like standing up because I am reminded of my height. I do not look in a mirror because of how ugly and short I am. A reminder that men will always look down on me thinking they can beat me up and if I were to magically get a girlfriend her friends and family will always remark on how she could do better.I do not see the point in continuing on. The only way a short guy like me can find some sort of happiness in this world is by being very rich. Otherwise no matter how hard I work no matter how social I am Ill always be 57. Ill always be a joke and a last option for women.Once I move out I plan on dying. I cannot live in this height obsessed society anymore.

978,I am a 22 yo with a history of severe depression including suicide attempts. I got those when I was around 18 and seeked medical support and I thought I was getting better. I found my will to live and tried to live a good life. But my father passed away suddenly and I kept having existential crises and now I do not see any point of living anymore. Few years back I used to cut my arms and thighs whenever I wanted to distract my pain to somewhere physical and now I do not even feel like doing anymore and its a lot more scarier. Every person in my life know me as this super happy person with no issue at all and I hate to burst their bubble by sharing my story with them. And I am at a point where I do not want anyone in my family to know that I am leading this double life and therefore I cannot get a professional to help me. I am at that point where nothing even hurts me anymore not even the thought of my loved ones missing me when I am gone.

We were close but of course friendships fade especially when you go to different highschools but we still hung out every now and then but now I know we will not. I do not think any of us have reentered such a tight knit friend group like we had before and since our friends passing we just realized we would never be that tight knit group anymore. I wish I had that support system I hate feeling lonely now. I see classmates posting about them going bowling and playing at Dave and busters. I hate them I hate that I cannot have what they have I hate my life. I have contemplated suicide before but I have never acted upon it today is the first day that i selfed harmed.

After some time I have thought myself how to live with depression but I cannot get rid of the option in my head to kill myself whenever something happens. That option is 247 in my head and even though I consider myself as happy person now sometimes I still think about it. My question is how can I force myself to not see it as an option. It currently is the biggest obstacle I have to face and I would like some advice from anyone that has similar experience.DISCLAIMER!I have no intent in killing myself. I have learned to not listen to those thoughts. They still remain in my head and I seek any not only professional advice in how to at least reduce those thoughts ideally to get rid of them.Thank you in advance for any suggestions or advice. How to deal with suicidal thoughts?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

I cannot do it anymore,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1014,I am not going to win. I am just not. Its chronic its not wellcontrolled with medication or therapy. I cannot take care of myself beyond taking medication in the mornings and dragging myself to appointments in the afternoon. I do not know whether Ill starve because I cannot get myself eat or break down from lack of sleep first. Or just speed things up myself.There genuinely is nothing to keep me afloat. I have no reason to be alive. I am not wanted or seen or cared for by anyone. I add nothing at all to the world around me. People avoid me because I am so depressed that I am a burden and annoyance to them. I am so brutally unhappy it hurts and there is nothing I can do to change it. I am going to die. Depression is going to kill me and I am going to be just another statistic. I do not even care because not a single person will notice I am gone in the first place. I am just waiting for my depression to kill me at this point,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1015,14 yo. i do not want to do anything anymore. my passion for everything that i once liked enjoyed or benefited me has gone out of the window. and i do not see the benefit in doing them any more. some days when i wake up from a 4 hour sleep i wish id had just never woken up at all and that i would just fall asleep forever and never wake up again. i always said that dreams were better than real life. and that has been the only statement i have ever made where i think i have been right. i hate talking to other people in fear that i will muck up. I am already quite introverted but now every time some even does something as simple as greeting me i want to get as far away from them as possible to prevent conversation where i will inevitably mess up. my daily schedule now consists of wake up do school go back upstairs and lay there until i have dinner. i have no will to get up and do something that even i know will be good for me. i want to just go away and that is the drifting thought that frequents me in my brain. i believe that everyone hates me which they probably do due to me being very unlikable and they just keep me around for their own social advantage. i frequently want to just run away from every human and cry in a corner where i can just forget i even exist. i do not want to tell anyone and i do not know if that is a good or a bad thing since i probably just burden other people with my presence and i will just annoy and make them hate me. but i want to know if its worth telling someone or if I am just being a teenage hypochondriac. what should i do? sorry for ranting i just needed to get this out of my head and online. i do not want to kill myself. i just want to disappear.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1016,I think of killing myself everyday. I have tried so hard to deny this but its literally the truth. It does not matter if I am having a good day or not I think about not being alive.I constantly have to immerse myself into art to keep myself from thinking about it. I have to put on my happy face for my family because then they will get worried and be in my face 247 like they did in the past and its triggering. Then again none of them really care. Its like oh she wants to kill herself let me find out why then leavegossip after I doI tend isolate so my friends do not know I struggle with this. Its just sad when I am on calls and everyone is laughing then I am the back of my mind I literally know I just had a severe breakdown an hour ago. I feel like such a fake sometimes. I do not want to overwhelm other people with my problems so I just shut up.I struggle because I feel so empty. No matter what I do or achieve is helpful. I do tons of self care but it does not matter because I know the happiness I feel can shift in minutes.I know my disorder has an strong effect on this and its so draining. It hurts to live. It hurts to not even know who I am sometimes. I often lose interest in whatever I am doing then it comes back then leaves and its a cycle that feels so vicious. Exhausted,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1020,I have never had a friend in my life because everyone thinks I am weird. I am 20 years old and in college and I have not made a single friend. I just wish I had friends who I could hang out with and talk to and have a good time with. In high school I had zero friends too. I just do not see the point in living. what is the point of being alive if I do not have any friends?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1025,it is depressing to know that I actually feel lonely so bad. I did not even notice that I have been being like that before I get physical symtoms. How stupid.. How can I be so crucial to myself? I want to quit eveything. I feel sick of everything. When could I let myself go away from this world,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1027,I thought today would be different. I woke up early for a change went for some sprints in the park sorted out some Centrelink issues Australian government thing and helped my dad build a vine fence for his garden. I asked my dad for a short break to do do some tasks like buy a new mobile plan and the above Centrelink thing. When I came back down he scolded me saying that i should have left my tasks for night and how shitty of a worker I would be when I actual started working ditching tasks halfway. I guess he wanted me to stick with him and finish his project spending my whole day. And here I am again feeling like shit again because of my father's disapproval. I cannot even talk back because he is got anger issues and goes full retard when I trigger him he smashes plates. He never spent any time with me and only scolded me since childhood and he expects me to want to spend my whole day helping his project. Fk me dead. I thought today would be different,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1031,Nothing scares me more than reading post of older people late 40s saying they wish they killed themselves sooner. I know my life is shit and will not get better plus i hate everything about myself too. Not interested in therapy or hearing other peoples success stories to be honest glad it worked out for ya but in a world of over 8billion people of course you will have unlucky batches I want to die sooner than later,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1032,If you feel like you cannot really trust anyone you personally know with how you truly feel where can you actually turn to?This is a question for all of those who are on the edge of planning something permanent and are seeking a temporary cosmetic answer. Where does one turn to?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1033,I have posted here a few times under different names. I do not really know why. I guess I am hoping to feel better by shouting into the ether. I know this will not do anything and no one will see it but I find that oddly comforting. I have spent so long being a locked box that I do not know how to be anything else anymore so knowing no one is listening and that no one can help is a comfort. I am almost 30but I have always known where I would end up. Even when I was a kid I would cry myself to sleep knowing that one day I would make everyone and everything around me miserable. Lo and behold here I am. Married. Like an idiot. I just wanted to hope you know? I just wanted to try to fight some cosmic destiny that I felt was waiting for me. Maybe I was wrong? Maybe I could be happy? Maybe I could have a beautiful wife and child. But here I am. Married for 5 years and I have made the woman I love miserable. I have got a beautiful daughter that has to live with ME as a father. Why would I do that to someone? I am supposed to love these people and I was selfish enough to get involved in their lives. she is going to have some sort of emotional and behavioral issues just for being my daughter. Mental illness runs in the family but I was too greedy to not walk away and let her live a life where she did not know me. Where my wife did not choose to marry me. And now they have to suffer for it. They have this waste of space of time in their lives because I was too much of a coward to end it when I was a teenager and now it is too late. I knew I would never be happy or make anyone happy since I was ten. And twenty years later the proof is still here as plain as day but I could not stop myself from trying to live a normal life. I could not accept that it was not what. I deserved. I know they will never see this. But I am sorry. I am truly sorry that you have had the horrible luck of meeting me. there is nothing I could do to ever make it up to either of you. I just hope you will forget me one day. This will get lost too. And that is okay.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1035,Nothings enjoyable anymore. At work I do not have friends and cannot figure out how to have a conversation with anyone. At home my mom hates me. Video games used to be my escape but now they do not do anything for me and the people who were my friends just get on to talk about themselves ignore me when then disappear for 2 months.Idk what to do I do not want to wake up anymore,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1045,It just feels like a drug. A bottle to drown the pain and a knife to because some fukcing dammage. It might just be me but the week of pain from one night just feels deserved. Fuck me! Why is cutting an instinct,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1051,I lay in bed for hours to the point of back pain. I get up for work 30 minutes before I have to clock in. I have no motivation to do anything on my days off I literally stare at my computer screen and have to force myself to do something. The bare minimum. More and more I find myself wanting to end it. Would that be so bad? I ask myself. I am lonely always broke hopeless and disgusting looking and half blind. I know nobody could ever actually want me. I have a decent paying job but am always playing catch up financially.In the end I resolve not to kill myself though I do not want to continue living. I would not be upset if something killed me. No I think Id be grateful. I am always tired.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1055,I am sick and tired of people bullshit. I love how I can be talking to a women for a few months go on dates and everything and be having a good time. But soon as they realize that I get attached easily. Also that I am insecure about the relationship and need reassurance every once awhile becuase I have been cheated on numerous times and been fucked over by family and friends they just up and leave without a fucking care in the world. I just cannot do this shit anymore. Honestly I wish I could just fucking die and not need to worry about it anymore. Becuase I fucking hate being lonely it is the worst feeling in the world for me and I just do not fucking understand the double standard in life. It is fine for a woman to act like this in a relationship but soon as a guy does it he is practically trash to them. I regret joining the marines now just becuase of how mentally fucked the left me when I got out and I just want to be done with it. Fucking done with everything,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1058,Maybe its just me alone in this but it feels like both the job market and the housing market are so inexplicably fucked. I am 23 years old and still live with my fucking family because no matter what fucking job I get I do not make enough fucking money to live in this shit hole of a town. Tried to apply for something better with my degree and instead I just hear Jack shit back. No apartments or homes available for rent are anywhere near my price range and I just cannot move out of town because that costs money I do not fucking have. This close to ending it all because there is no way out. Fuck it all Everything is so fucked,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1059,months after quitting my antidepressants I do not have the same feeling of depressed brain fog but the pain of it all never goes away. I am convinced I am still better off without them and I think my mind has been a bit healthier since I was able to quit but the emotional and physical pain brought from the depression and anxiety are not much better.there is more good days without the meds but the bad days still tear me down. I have not gone a single day without thinking about harming and suicide in almost a decade. I am terrified of hurting the people around by ending my life but I do not know how much longer that fear can keep me here. there never seems to be a way I can really articulate the pain I am in and I am ready for it all to stop. posting here has not been very helpful in the past but I am desperate and cannot keep myself going anymore it never ends,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1067,Recently I have been plagued with these violent thoughts which have left me exhausted they are like episodes of violence towards myself but I do not know why its happeningIve reached out for help telling people I am going to kill myself and even asked to be put in a hospital for my safety but no one cares I have talked to a crisis team and the access team but they are not helping meIs there anything I can do to stay safe? Depression and suicidal thoughts,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1072,I was sleeping with my bird today it was her favourite thing to do but when I woke up she would been crushed by me and I killed her when I was sleeping.

I am such a loner.. I am thankful for my wife. my sister. my mom. my daughter. that is it. I got no one else. have not had a conversation that matters with anyone else in over 10 years. I come off as a weirdo. I guess things could be worst but they could have certainly been better if it was not for my stupid ass. Feeling the pressure,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1076,By all accounts I should be dead right now. The amount of pain and hardship I have been through is not something that I can just live with. Basically any kind of normal life for me is out of the question. Despite me being depressed 247 I am just not in the mood to end it. What the hell? Why do I still want to go on?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

I am trying to make more friends but I am desperately struggling they either do not text back or start ghosting me. i started cutting again after a few weeks of being away this time i do not know its not mainly to cope more like giving myself pain for making others suffer. every time i make a mistake fail to help someone or anything bad in general i count them and tally it onto my arms. i do not count the smallest of bad things because I am going to be tatted with marks all over my body and i want the pain for only things that are significant to me. here is a diary entry from 18th july 1138pmtoday was a really shitty day but i love her so fucking much. i fucking hate how i messed up so fucking bad that she lost feelings. i want to marry her i love her that much but cannot even give her anything to like me for anymore. ihope she finds someone that loves her more than me because i clearly fucking could not. i cut today and ill cut again tomorrow for all the stupid shit I have done. i wish id fucking die and suffer the pain to see her either get back with him or get with someone better than me.goodnight end noteit may seem a dramatic as fuck but i do not know what to do anymore.

I know that none of this matters it is just my life.I live in a state where people value independence traditional manliness guns and Donald Trump. I recognize that my experience does not fucking matter I am just another deviant leftist. I am poor. Both my parents were teachers so we did not start with much but I managed to lose everything I had and more. I have been homeless twice. Both times I clawed my way back from nothing.

I am just beyond happy that I found someone who seems to perfect yet still loves someone as not perfect as me. he is been with me for a few months over a year and we tell each other everything. we have been talking about our future together like what our wedding would be like where our future home would be our future pets ect. I love the future we have created in our minds. I would do anything for that to be our reality. Lately I have been feeling almost normal. Like the pure pain of life is no more than a slight pinch.

My life this past month has been nothing but a spiraling out of hell from my mothers cancer diagnosis to my grandmothers passing nothing seems to work out . I get that everything happens for a reason but why do some of us get the short stick every time ? It just make me want to give up on trying . Trying for a better love a better life a better outcome . I know that is not how I was raised but something has to give .were born alone and we die alone so why keep with the waiting game and just do it now ? I know this is an empty plea but would someone give me a reason not to ? Were born alone we die alone,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1160,I am so utterly miserable i cannot help but see the world in black amp white and how miserable the rest of society is around me nothing is appealing about the 95 suburban lifestyle there is no way anybody actually wants this right? we just settle for it because were convinced that is the only way to make it in this world. i hold onto this little bit of hope that ill get out of the cycle and live the life i want to at some point but i fear until then ill never find satisfaction or an appeal to living. life is fucking short and its a hard thing to accept once you realize it I am constantly chasing after time. if i do not make it out of here by 30 i genuinely do not see myself continuing to stay alive. this is impossible,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1161,Hey you all. I just discharged from the psych unit today after about 4 days of voluntary hold. it is hard to sum the experience up fully but to put it simply it was beautiful. I met some amazing people who were struggling right along side me. These people will forever precious to me. I was prescribed medication and I am feeling a bit better already going through the weirdgettingusedtoit phase. Overall I feel that the visit gave me a new perspective and a renewed desire to live. To anyone feeling like they are at the end of what they have do not be afraid to reach out for help. We can get through this tunnel together. Your life is precious and honestly it is worth a trip to the ER if you are feeling ready to give up. There is hope and there are people who care about you and want to help you. Please do not be afraid of getting help. Thank you guys for always being there throughout these years shit has been rough but I feel like I am finally on the path to crawling my way out of this.

Tired opening up to other people for them to just make fun of me or pretend that they care. Tired to tell myself only reason I am still alive is i do not want to destroy my brothers life knowing that my brother would not even care only real reason is me being a coward. Tired looking for a fucking reason in tomorrow...I do not know what to do. I do not know why even try.When i fell my friends my family showed their real faces. Showed how much they do not care.

1184,I have been having more and more suicidal thoughts and I keep going through violent mood swings which just ends up hurting people I want to talk to mom about it but she is just going to send me to a mental hospital like she did with my sisters I cannot talk about my issues,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1186,At first i did not know what it was i just felt empty sad lost interest in all of my hobbies nothing was fun to do anymore. I did not take it seriously probably just your teenager hormones messing around i told myself.I began searching on the internet for weeks and i eventually understood what it was fucking depression that is. Probably caused from many years of extreme shyness social anxiety and self isolation i was scared of people and i had no personality.I failed highschool 3 times it took me 6 years to finish highschool. In my 5th year of highschool 1920 years old i only had 4 subject to finish so i had pretty much 80 of free time the whole year. I promised myself i would get a job and actually be someone do something with my life. I failed got called for 6 interviews and i did not even attend 4 of them huge panic attacks last 2 were on a more discrete place with less people around so i eventually had the guts to go inside first one i had a panic attack right at the beginning interviewer seemed cool about it at let me take some deep breaths i went through the interview but he said at the end I am sorry but you should really consider seeking a therapist. Last interview i did sweat a lot i had a very shaky voice i was extremely anxious and could barely look at her in the eyes 5 minutes into the interview she says you are not really qualified for this job I am sorry and i left.After that day i hit the rock bottom a few months later i rested my forehead on a loaded shotgun for more than an hour trying to get the courage to pull the trigger but the only thing that came to my mind was my mom's reaction seeing me dead with my head blown out. I could not do it.Last year of highschool only 1 subject left and again could not even apply for a job my anxiety was getting worse and so was my depression. One day at 5 in the morning i decided this is it I am going to end it right now. I got into my car and drove to the nearest cliff by the sea huge 100m drop i just sat there on the edge for about 20 minutes trying to find a reason not to do it once again the only thing that i could think of was my mom's reaction. Eventually an old fisherman saw me and called the police i kind of got away saying i enjoyed sitting while looking at the sea and i do it nearly every morning.Got into university at 21 years old 2 years went by and just being occupied with something eventually kept my mind busy and suicide thoughts went away for once. Nowadays 23 years old 2 years of university went by still never had a GF or even a female friend i made 0 friends i still have 0 experience talking with women i have not had a female classmate since i was 16. I promised myself that university would change my life just like it does to many people once again i failed myself my social interactions got a lot better and people do not notice that much that I am weird but I am still shy as fuck.Summer holidays just began depression is growing again at a fast rate no one to go out with i have 3 friends from highschool but we go out like once a month at best my closest friend just got a GF so he only talks to me like once a week just for regular stuff. 2 weeks ago i spent most of the time searching for ways to peacefully kill myself without making too much of a mess i planned to jump of a 75m bridge into the water or maybe try again the 100m cliff and also thought about taking a bunch of sleeping pills go into my car and and let a butane gas cylinder open inside... I do not know how to help myselfSorry for long post i have too much shit going on in my mind and who knows if i end up doing it in the near future i will send my reddit account to my closest friends so at least they know what i had going on in my mind. 4 and a half years of depression and suicide thoughts is there any hope? 23M,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1190,I am barely holding on and nobody has noticed I have been sad everyday and my anxiety just grows other times I feel numb or calm. A lot has happened the past couple of days its hard to process.. everyday I wake up and this feels like a literal nightmare. I also do not know if I can trust anymore I just feel so sad and I want to end it all. there is no hope left I do not see a future I do not see all the great things others see I just see more trouble obstacles up ahead I have been through so much already and I do not want to go through more. My city has been in shambles and under attack because of looting and violence buildings have been burnt to the ground and now that things are a bit quiet they want to rebuild. The residents would patrol everyday and night taking turns but they issued a statement that they have done their job and they will not be patrolling anymore which makes me anxious and afraid I feel as if they are letting their guard down way too early those looters want to come destroy our homes and lives too. I do not have a good feeling about this how can anyone feels safe after this? This life is already unbearable I do not feel good being alive anymore there is nothing for me here..

1193,You know that feeling of going insane ?it is a hard feeling to describe but I will do my best.it is losing the ability to think clearly. it is all just chaos. No real thoughts anymore.it is looking at yourself in the mirror and seeing your eyes are not what they used to be.it is doing weird things that you cannot explain why you are doing them. Nightmares or no dreams at all.Impulsively hurting yourself not hurting myself serious things like slapping myself over and over or biting myself etc without thinking about itampx200BSometimes there is a good day but they have been becoming rarer and rarer. At best a good couple of hours.I have been dealing with mental illness for close to 10 years now and I am only 19I find it hard to believe that I will find my way or that it will change when I am older.I am held on a leash by all these issues I have got and the list keeps growing.I have been looking into legal euthanasia a while ago read up on some stories of people my age asking for the same usually denied so they end up committing suicideI am not ready to die yet but i cannot see myself going much further then 30.I wish i could be a kid again. I was social smart and without a worry in the world.Nothing seriously traumatic even happened to me. But one side of my family is riddled with mental disease. I guess I am just another victim. I would not be the first to end it on my own terms. Not yet .. but maybe soon. have not left the house in about 6 months. Reaching my breaking point.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1198,what is the point? what is the point in anything? right now the only reason I am not dead yet is because i cannot die with trauma from the mental fucking hospital and also because i need to gain the trust of my parents.I will need to wait for a few more months till i can plan my next attemptbut really what is the point in all of this?nothing matters and i have no hopethe reason i live is because of this one person this ONE online friend i havesomehow i still have enthusiasm when talking to himbut my parents forced me to stop talking to him so i do not know what i will dotheres a difference between 'reasons I am not dead yet' and 'reasons i live'reasons I am not dead yet would be factors that are an obstacle to your deathreasons you live would be the reasons that give you some sort of purpose and meaning to not die yourselfbut i am mainly here due to 'reasons I am not dead yet'nothing makes me happy and i despise almost everythingnothing worksi know that this is temperorary and whatever i know itbut that does not mean i have to bear with it everytime it comesit eventually goes away yes but it comes back as welland i can see that the tiny amount of time these feelings are not as intense is not a proper reason for me to liveits not worth itthat tiny bit of peace and then this suffering againits not worth what is the point,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1208,I am 28 unemployed and sick with Covid. I am single do not have my own place and am constantly being moved from house to house just trying to make it by. Now I do not know where to go or what to do with my life anymore and its driving me insane...I have always been a pretty cheery guy but these past few years have really solidified my loss of direction. I feel like I have no sense of self anymore. I am smart physically capable no records even own my own car. But I still feel like its all in service to nothing. Should I just strike out and try and get my own place? Then what? What do I do with it?! What is my purpose!I never really thought like this before a few years ago. Stupid thing is nothing even happened no big break up or great loss in my life. I just woke up one day and started asking why. Ask enough times and eventually the silence starts to eat away at you at least it did me...I do not really think I believe in suicide as an answer here but it would be nice to not feel so damn alone and isolated in my own head. Maybe I just need someone to share the space with. Someone to reach out and grab onto just to make sure I am still on earth from time to time. I do not even know anymore... Sorry I do not know where to put all these feelings. So I will leave them with you...,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1210,in my country there are no opportunities no options NOTHING. i cannot even leave because every other country fucking makes it near impossible to get a citizenship i just want better opportunities to live a better life how is that a fucking crime? my country is so damn anti science its fucking insane. i just want to be a scientist i want to study space but guess what? i cannot because i was born in a shithole country. even if i study engineering there are no jobs what am i even going to do? be a math teacher in a fucking middle school? fuck no. why did i have to be born in a third world shithole. god i fucking hate everything. i just want to die why did i have to be born in a third world shithole,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1214,This is just one long rant.My family fights. Mainly it is just Daniel and I Daniel being the one my mom married before I was born. I do not consider him anything close to a father figure but he is the only thing I have other than teachers counselors or school staff. Fighting has taken a toll on me a lot. I am always the one at fault and he makes sure to phrase it in a way that makes me the one in the wrong always. This has ended up with me scared of loud noises feeling like a failure feeling unloved depressed scared of hurting people scared of being around people scared of making mistakes scared of offending people scared of authoritarian figures that would coincide with father figures defensive rude in many cases and in some ways unable to properly read cues though this might be an autism thing. For just over ten years we have been digging a huge pit of anger and hate mainly my hate for him and the grief that comes with not feeling loved by someone who you see everyone else loved by. The depression stemming from the constant battling has ended me up in hospital three times due to being suicidal after fights mainly because I feel like a disappointment. I end up wanting to punch him in the face push him out the door and lock every single entrance but I will never be strong enough emotionally for that. I am already a failure as is.I find it incredibly hard to cry mainly because of how much I did in the early years and have ended up being semiviolent when it comes to confrontations with him. I will end up throwing things or slamming doors because I want to get away from him at all costs I want to put something in between me and him. This usually ends up with me wanting to kill myself like today. I did the only thing I could think of in the midst of the pain and depression today I left the house and walked to the open space nearby. there is a bench there I am fond of. I managed to cry up there. I am glad nobody was out today. I contemplated commiting. I am glad I did not. I contemplated running away. I am glad I did not. The only thing keeping me sane is the people I love and I hate it so much. I feel like I should live for more than just spite and to make others happy. I just want to be happy.The thing that hurts the most is when I see families having fun together. A dad and his child reading a book on the sidewalk. A mom and her daughter walking the family pets. A husband and wife taking their toddler in a stroller.It makes me feel raw hate. Hate to myself that I cannot be a better person. Hate to myself that I cannot have that because I cannot control what little temper I have. Hate that despite everything I do he cannot take responsibility for anything. I hate it. I hate me.How can I be happy when my whole life is pain and sadness? How can I be happy when the person I am supposed to look up to despises me more than the dogs I pass in their yards? Why do the dogs pause to see if I am ok longer than he does. I want happiness. Please. I would give anything for that peace.tldr I am in pain. I hate myself my dad everything I am.

I am sick of having mental illnesses that make me scared to be alone and clingy and codependent I am sick of having to go through various coping exercises to deal with small issues. I am so sick of it. I want to have a normal brain and normal reasoning naturally I do not want everything to be a wheel of mental torture anymore. I want to be normal so badly but its so hard. I feel so lonely and do not look forward to anything anymore. I just want this to be over I have never felt so low before. I used to be able to find good somewhere but I literally cannot anymore.

If you do not smile genuinely I will revoke privilegesIt makes me feel more like shit. It makes me feel worthless and hated.I just have to take a smile in front of him to make him think I am okay.A voice emerged from deep within my twisted mind reminding me of how hypocritical I am.I never give him the genuine smile he expects from me. I am not good enough so I do think that I deserve all of the things that he takes away from me.I should be able to just snap out of it as he wants me to.But I cannot and that just makes me feel more worthless.I do not have the right to feel like this when there are people out there that have it worse than me.that is why I should die.

I know they can be so harmful and I do not want to deal with it. I also do not have the heart to take my life because I know people close to me will be in shock and I will because so much pain.But living is such a pain I do not know who to talk about that I cannot even get up in the morning properly without forcing myself to do so.I hate forcing myself to do stuff I hate myself my mind my body.

1237,I never had anyone to open up to not until I met my girlfriend. Things were going great. The moment I get attached to someone I start to slowly open up. I trust her. I share my traumas to her and I think it is now overwhelming her. By the time I open up about the people causing my trauma she gets mad at how obnoxious these certain people are. I do admit that at times I speak ill to these people. This is the time where I am infuriated and speak whatever that I have been locking up in my mind. Unconsciously bottled up emotions then start to act up. I am a very distant person. Once I get attached to someone its something else. The everyday person that everyone knew well is far from the way I act towards the person I am attached to. I have observed that she is starting to get overwhelmed about the problems I have gone and still going through. Despite talking about this and that I can easily perceive her body language. She checks up on me and wants me to open up. she is the only person I could open up to. I remembered the moment where she told me she is THAT special for me to finally open up. She was giddy about this idea. I have reminded her that she should not fix me but I do understand that as my very partner there is a sense of responsibility to it despite the constant reassurance. I am doing my best to pretend to her that I am having great progress on being genuinely happy. Since then I started to keep silent about my personal conflicts however she could at times notice. Now here I am in reddit venting out anonymously. It is my only escape. I can vent out have temporary peace knowing there is such media platform with users I deeply relate to be detracted from reality and avoid putting much burden on my partner. This may sound stupid to some that I would sacrifice my own wellbeing and dignity to her but if I had to be honest I have never felt love being in love and being loved for a long time. she is the best that has ever happened to me. I value her to my very core. Without her I am certain that I would be dead right now. Losing her is my last straw. As long as I have reddit a place to vent out there will always be a number of people who will bring me to a whole sense of belonging. Hiding from my partner,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1241,About a month ago I moved out of my hometown because of someone who i used to be close with. Being near her makes me feel all kinds of negative emotions mostly because I am torn about what to really feel about our situation. I cannot fully hate hermaybe because I really loved her in more ways than one. So I moved out and I had my birthday recently. It was one of the most lonely birthdays I had but some people still managed to send me birthday greetings and some even video called me. I was starting to feel better about when I saw a notification informing me that one of my friends commented on her new post. When I checked it it was a provoking post subtly informing the world that missing some things in your life that were there for a long time in this case my presence can be the best thing that can even happen with a picture of her smiling. I was so angry and sad and my depression starts kicking in again. After what I did after giving up my proximity to my family and friends the comfort I had just to make things better she just did that. I did not tell anyone why I left just did for her privacy for no one to bother her and this is what I get. And it sucks more because I have no one to tell this except strangers online. I just want this to end. I have been doing well for two months but a post from that person makes me want to hurt myself again.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1243,I am 18 and I am depressed and no one knows I have been like this for awhile now but it gets worse as the years past by i remember the last time I have actually been truly happy and it was in the 6th grade. I have never felt at home when I am home. i hate my parents and even though they are not that bad i feel like they only take care of me so that when they grow old someone will take care of them instead of the actually loving me as the first thing they say when they tell me what job to consider is that they want that when they grow old that they will be taken care of. i also feel really shitty due to my social life not being that good i mean i have a few good friends but no one knows how i feel. my love life is also shit because i keep getting rejected which i understand cus who would want to be with a guy like me but what makes it feel bad is that i feel like people especially girls i like only want me when they need help in their studies the constant rejection made me numb to it and emotional pain as even when i want to cry i cannot but i really want to because everyday my heart aches and i just want to release all this pent up frustration. i also have a lot of suicidal thoughts and keep thinking of using the kitchen knife to cut my wrists and slice my throat. i also feel like going to the college of my dreams is impossible due to me being just average. my life is so shit but i do not want to die I am just so tired of it because all i want is to be loved i just want to vent,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1255,well to be honest I do not even know why I am here but I just need somewhere I can voice my thoughts as I feel like they are building in my head to the stage that I would rather talk to my self than others. it may sound like I am exaggerating right but I spend soo much time alone that even when I am with others id rather not be. this is my fault either I was such a funny kid class clown so popular in school and even after I finished school too. but that all changed when I was shipped over seas by my mum. I cannot lie and say know I do not see that it was for my benefit I could have simply died had I stayed there and for a parent that is enough reason. but to send me somewhere like that and treat me the way they did really stripped me for humanity. I saw things I should not have and that is when the thoughts started. I was locked up for about 7 months over seas as my family thought it would help me but there is where I create a version of life in my head and know I cannot escape it. my life is finally going good I have worked soo hard for that but mentally I am suffering soo much. I cannot tell anyone this in real life because why would humans care. they never cared when I really needed them and know it feels like if they do care is because they want something. and also I promised my self that I will never be vulnerable again in this life which is another reason I can never tell anyone. so I smile at the few people I do see but in saying ALLL OF THIS I do want to make friends and there is apart of me that wants to be accepted in someone is life as I really feel like I have never belonged.

1266,I do not like my life I do not like society I do not like the future that is awaiting us and I do not want to live anymore. If I did not have family I would kill myself but since I know they would blame themselves for the rest of their lives I sadly do not feel the freedom to do that. Over the last years I have been increasingly isolating myself from the world often not answering phone callstexts etc. because I just do not see the point in doing anything if at the core of my beliefs I do not see the point in living. Some facts about me I am male 29 pretty healthy have a university degree get by fincancially live in one of the best places in the world and had a decent childhoodupbringing. My feelings are not an emotional reaction but rather a rational conclusion formed over the years.I really do not want to go to therapy I have tried it twice. It makes me feel like this life is even more useless if I need to work my ass off just to be able to afford therapy so that they can ask me fancy questions tell me to meditate or to medicate so everything might get a little bit more bearable.I just do not want to live!

1271,Whenever I voice out my suicidal thoughts to a friend she always says just think about what your mom would feel. She does not explicitly say that killing yourself is a selfish act but that is the point I am getting from her.

It feels like no matter which path I choose I will mess it up and hurt someone and I do not want to mess up my babys life. Sometimes I wish I could just kill myself without hurting the baby and my fianc. I really love my fianc and Id never want to make him feel that sort of pain.

1302,gtIf its too long do not read .Ok this is so lame and desparate sounding. but I have some questions which I do not want to keep asking or to be thinking and wondering when I start to get better with my ocd. I have two Questions. Anyone who can give a good answer thanks. Not just what I want to hear. But the truth. Because I am not planning on asking these questions ever again. And I want to know the real consequences of this sin. Its really important since it was singled out and I really want sound bible advice on this sin and the punishments if you know it . First on the blasphemy of The Holy Ghost. I did it like 5 months ago out of bitterness for my life. gt gtAnd as paul in the bible said that because many were bitter many be came defiled I think that is what he said. So when I realized I was angry at my life and was trying to do better. And I was not done with some habits I tried to promise God TO quit. I still had no real joy in my life and I promised to give up things I loved. Like certain music and foods. Also I was not very nice. Because I loved my family. But they like other things because of their judgements and the things they say to me I tried to protect myself. So it could have both been bitterness and like ptsd and trying to avoid them and being tough and walking with a hard look and a stump so they would not feel comfortable enough to try to speak to me. gt gtJust to say some messed up useless stuff. which is harder for me to get over. Mainly because I do not have any real friends or people who just like me. Only my siblings and parents. I have depended on them for a lot and that was where I went wrong. Trying to make them love things about me they just hated and they basically shuned me. For an example this may be tmi. But just to show some sick stuff my dad has bullied me about. Once I had a pad. For periods. And you know not to flush them. gt gtSo instead of like my mom she wraps it in the paper and puts it in a bag so it will not leak or anything and so you cannot see it in the trash. Now I was feeling bad and did not want to get one. So I got like basically the whole roll of tissue and wraped my pad in it. Now like in the next thirty mintues my dad was wodering where all the tissue went and freaking out. And he decided to look through the trash because he was trying to firgure out why it was all gone. And found a wad of tissue and then when seeing there was a pad init or it was bleeding through and then he like came out and asked if it was me. gt gtThen I said yeah that is mine. He said it was disgusting and that he did not want to see that. And then he grabbed me by the arm and like brang me in their mom and dads room and yelled at me. And like said it was gross and nasty and I looked at my mom and she was like what ever I am tired of you and then he ask what was wrong with my hair and I said my hair is fine. Then he got a mirror and was mockingly like does this look done and laughing. Then he said Id be shocked if I saw you in heaven. Over a pad with blood that he went looking for in the trash. gt gtThink he went and dug through the trash looking for shit. that is like me going and putting my hand in the toliet and finding shit and being shocked what did you expect you was going to find doing that. So that is just a taste of what he does. Trust me I do not always complain about every minor inconvenience. Then I do not want to be ew because God is God and can say what he wants. But I have an older sister she is 24 and is kidna fast and she was a teen mom. And I kind of judged her tho I was only jealous of her because dad loved her so much. Like anytime my sister would come around Id love seeing her and my niece. gt gtMore then all my siblings and mom. she is my half sister by the way only one who loved seeing her more was my dad. So that being said I still was jealous of her and it totally was not her fault. Now all this shit was in my head and I was bitter. and I kind of would take it out on my siblings not out loud but in my head. and I was angry at GOD AND MY FAMILY FOR WEEKS BLASPHEMYING AND STUFF BEING RUDE. And I decide to read the bible and then he had like passages for me cuz I blaspheymed and was trying so hard to be good. And then the bible had a passage about the virgins in israel doing a very horrible thing and saying as if it were a little thing they were more defiled then everyone idk. gt gtBut also it had one about ahloa and her sister and I knew that was for me tho I am not a whore. It was like this is the sins of your sister. And my golly that were totally describing my sister being a little fast eatting a lot and being pridful and kind of selfish. But then he said init she is better then you. Like it said your sister is like in all she has done better then you and for that momment it was like a badly written sitcom. You know like where the sad and depressed one keeps trying to show their good and better. gt gtAnd the other is care free and happy and does not care as much but some how ends up better then you and that is how this is God tried to paint me out to be this evil and envious person which sometimes I am. So that brings me to these questins like in my other post I do not like suprises I like to know things so I do not have to worry about them. I sont mind being told no I am not peter. But thinking your going to do or get something and then not is like not very good and I know you guys are so much more wiser then me and read the Bible more and listen so this is the question this maraggie supper of the lamb is said only blessed are those which are called. gt gtAnd I hate being left out of stuff. Tho my dad says some in heaven will not go now like saul when he was rejected from being king because of his disobediecne. I just wanted to know since I called the holy ghost evil and also I um publicly tried to slander him in a sneaky way online if you look at my other post you will see.. Dose that hurt my chances like is there any bible verse to back this thought of mine up just asking. And that last one is as you all know this see I read something about like in the greek bible translation it was a novum testamentum graece and it said I do always let go the sons of men the sins and the blasphemy as much as it is blasphemyed but he who blasphemys against the Holy Ghost has not let go but is guilty of an eternal sin. gt gtSo I also do not really want eteranal guilt so those are the only two questions thanks.

1306,I do not even want to die that much. I just want the pain to stop. But it will not by itself. Just increasing and swirling together like the thoughts.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1311,I think to the point when I get tension headaches. And that is when I cannot think anymore. that is when I just have a headache and hate myself a lot without any logic. Although I still hate myself even when I think. For the things I cannot even control. I am such a loser. I was blessed to be born in Iran a 3rd world garbage county. And I was also blessed by being lgbt in this fucking place to spice it up my family is also broke and do not accept me. Sometimes I think my dad did not even want a kid.. But then again I keep thinking if I had anything that I ever wanted if all my issues disappear would I be happy? I do not know. Happiness feels like really non existent concept. it is all the naive happiness when I was a kid. I am like 17 now. It feels like nothing absolutely matters. I did not know what matters anymore except my 2 friends. But I feel like a damn burden with these amount of issues that I have how much I hate myself and how much of a loser I am. I am constantly thinking they are going be tired of me soon enough They are so kind and sweet but it feels like In the long run maybe even they would be happier to not have me.Thing is I think I do not want to die. I do not know why. It just seems like this is not the way. This is not it. Thoughts of offing myself keep popping to my head and make me feel like it can be a solution and it annoys me so much. But I want to live. I am just so lost and confused and I feel like Idk what is it that can be done. I just.. idk. I really do not know. I keep crying like a baby at times.

1317,I have been depressed since 14 people bullied me I have been told I am ugly short some how balding at young age I have been told all kind of shit even my family used to bully me and make fun of me calling me ugly i felt alone... now I am 17 yrs old still depressed every single time i find a solution it does not work maybe ill cheer up for a day or two but then get right back to it because of depression. So my actual question is is there hope like for real everybody told me there is and i should keep on going and never give up that kind of stuff but really I do not see anything changing the only thing that has changed is my overthinking anxiety insomnia and stress are worse that is all so should i just end it? Am i going to continue till my end of my life like this please tell me I will not. I have a quick question.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1321,Do you ever wake up suicidal spend the day feeling suicidal and go to bed wishing you would never wake up again? I have been dealing with this feelings for a while now. I believe that things will get better that life will get easier but lately I kind of feel like it is not worth it to go through all of this mess just because i feel like i might get a glimpse of happiness in the far future. I just cannot take it anymore.I tried talking to some of my friends about this stuff they try to be nice and supportive but they cannot make me feel better. I know i should seek professional help but let us just say it is not an easy option for a person in my circumstances. What would you do if you were in my shoes? I feel like it is not worth it,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1330,Is this what life is? Just going through the motions chore after chore for the rest of my life? Just one meaningless day after another? I ruined my life. I hate myself. I have no passion for life no hope no dreams anymore. I lost my chance at true love. I have no worthwhile future. I do not think I can do this anymore.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1332,I do not have much to say. I started cutting myself again and I cannot really tell anybody and get it off my chest so I will just confess here. I started self harming again,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1336,I just drank a bunch and spilled my guts to my husband about how miserable I am every day and how I low key want to die. I feel super Embarrassed and hopeless and I do not know how to proceed.Everyday of my life has been so exhausting and meaningless except when I get the rare chance to lay with my husband or go get taco bell as sad as that sounds its my reality How do I find the will to exist on a day to day basis especially when my brain has been wired to be miserable for as long as I can remember?I feel like I cannot go on much longer. I have never seriously considered suicide before now but i just want to rest. I am beyond lost,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1338,No one cares whether I am happy sad angry excited anxiouswhatever.They care that I am alive because if I killed myself they would not get to talk to me anymore or they would look like a bad parent they would be lonely they would be traumatized etc. etc. They care that I am working volunteering paying rent taking care of my appearance going to therapy etc. etc.They do not care how I feel.I posted something on my main account asking about how to talk about feelings because I really genuinely do not know and I am feeling very alone and all three comments so far can be surmised with do not. This is pretty much the same reaction I have gotten from everyone in my life. Even my therapist has asked why it is so important to me that people understand how I am feeling.I do not need people to understand. I just need someone to care. it is deeply deeply upsetting to me to think that it makes no difference to anyone in my life besides me obviously whether I go through life constantly on the verge of suicide taking meds having panic attacks and sobbing alone on my floor every couple of days as I have been since I was about eleven years old... I am now 25. or whether I go through life feeling generally content and lovedjust so long as I am functional and do not take up too much space with my emotions.Every time I try to talk about how I feel I get shut down the subject gets changed the other person starts complaining about their own life or I am told that I am upsetting them. When I was fourteen I told my friend that I was cutting myself she told our priest and the priest CALLED THE POLICE and my parents and had me detained until I swore up and down that I would never ever do it ever again of course I did lmao. I still do sometimes. That was the most extreme reaction I ever got but others have been similar. I had someone I would been in a relationship with for MONTHS ghost me after I cried to them over the phone for instance. I tried calling three different friends for help while I was hallucinating from alcohol withdrawal a little over a year ago and literally Every Single One Of Them had a response like Um... that really sucks... Good thing you are quitting though. Okay here is what happened to ME todayit is just so frustrating. Even when you Google how to talk about your feelings you will get a lot of results telling you that no one cares.I do not know. It makes me want to end it sometimes. I am just so fucking sick of being all alone. I want to just LOSE IT and scream at everyone sometimes but I do not think that would be fair. I know it is ultimately my responsibility to cope with my depression but... I cannot. I just cannot do it without any support. I have been trying for so long.I have been in therapy for years. I take meds. I exercise. I eat healthy. I try to get enough sleep. And now I have been sober for about a year. I even tried to make a career change but I have discovered I do not really want to do this either it is not the job. it is me. it is depression. I am just about ready to give up.Anyway. I am ranting. I did not know what else to do. Have a nice night if for some reason you read this hahaha,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1345,Finally set a date to end my life in August. Just quit my job and currently sitting in my car it feels like such a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.I want to enjoy the last few weeksmonths of my life doing things I have always wanted to do. I have a 5000 credit limit on my credit card and I am going to max it out before I go. I am thinking of going to a nice steakhouse maybe sushi a couple times skydiving and a couple other things right now. going to add some more stuff as I think of it.

1348,I am depressed but I do not want to kill myself. I am just depressed. I do not complain about it. Sometimes I feel good. Sometimes I feel bad. I get really bad manic depression sometimes but my face ALWAYS gets commented on. Cheer up you look lile you are about to cry even though I am not... I could be feeling great that day and somebody will make a comment. I have been hearing it constantly at work by new people I have met. Like I are not happy but I am not trying to be Unhappy and I wish It did not annoy other people! But today really got to me never had this in my entire life. Foreign guy to my country walks past me and starts laughing and fake crying while making a crying gesture... only me and him as I am walking past him. At first I am thinking he must be on a phone call... no way some guy is this loopy and could be so cocky...I could of seriously hurt this guy. I wanted to throw everything away and seriously hurt this guy. What the fuck is wrong with people or is it just me Another man walked past me today...I was very close to doing something stupid.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1361,Hello guys this is my first time making a post and first time talking about this but I felt comfort in the anonymous environment so firstly I have been having feelings of sadness and loneliness for a while now maybe a couple years and I just feel like I cannot trust anyone even my closest friends of years and years of friendship because I am so scared of being left venerable and sometimes I just feel like all the shit inside me just gets to a point where it blocks the light at the end of tunnel and sometimes I just feel like I am in a room enclosed by sandstone and my tears slowly erode away the stability and one day its all going to collapse and I am going to try and kill myself again but the thing is I do not want to all I want is to have my old life back where I could wake up and look forward to the future instead of now where when I wake up I just think of how shit I am of a person and how worthless I am for some fucking reason I have mentally tortured myself into thinking I need to protect people and if I cannot be there for the people I care about I am better off dead but to be honest I do not think anyone would notice or care and sometimes I feel like i cannot trustas in be around them or even talk to anyone because at any moment they might throw me under the bus I find myself always looking over my shoulder and its eating me inside. I am really hell bent on joining the military to get away from this place just so I can go die a death that will not make other people think how much of a worthless piece of shit I am and recently I have been really abusing drugs to numb everything like how I am using weed a lot more combined with alcohol and sometimes the harder drugs just so I can numb my body and feel maybe a inch of happiness I do not know what I am going to do probably just go end it because I do not see myself getting any further I do not know what to do anymore,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1362,Good days are few and far between I am exhausted and feel like garbageBack to sleep hopefully forever. Its going to be one of those days,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1363,Man I am fucking tired of shit. I liked a girl now she is dating my best friend. I see that shit every fucking day and it makes me fucking demotivated to do shit anymore. And all i can do is be happy for him while drowning in my own misery. Fuck life,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1366,This is not a joke. This is not a troll. I am in desperate need of help. I cannot find any reason to keep going on. I am very close to giving up and this time I am sure of it. I even freaking went to the store and bough supplies. I cannot do this anymore. I do not want to go thru with this but i do not see another option. Please. Help. I need help.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1367,I do not know how much longer I can go on tbh I do not like talking about things like this but recently I have found a sort of comfort in the anonymity of reddit. This sickness is taking over me I feel empty I feel gross I just feel so mad all the time. I wake up and I am mad that I did life is just a long waiting game but I have nothing to wait for. I stopped taking my meds and stopped going to therapy cold turkey because it was not helping. But now I have just spiraled out of control every moment is spent thinking of my emptiness. I really just want it to end. Staying up until 6 am crying and then sleeping till the afternoon sometimes I feel like I do not exist I graduated high school and felt like I got robbed of what I thought it would be I never attended a party had a group of friends longer than 6 months at a timehad a couple dudes who would hang around me and use me for drugs but I was naive so I thought it was different and they wanted to be friends and I have never kissed a girl let alone had sex. I remember my therapist asking every time if I had suicidal thoughts I always replied no but I felt so alienated by that I already had plans for it and thought that everyone was suicidal everyone said there for a while ah I am going to kms at the slightest inconvenience I would always say it in that notion but I would always feel that thought build up into a real action. Idk what life has in store or even how much I have left sometimes I really wish my life could have been different with some sort of meaning. Oh well you got to play your cards This is getting to be too much,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1377,I have none left absolutely none left. I have been struggling with depression and other mental illnesses for so long and I have no one to talk to. So please just give me one more reason to live. Please just give me a reason to live,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1381,I have had my thoughts about suicide however I am trying to withstand them and not think about them.I do not have a good connection with my dad and I often think about how much happier I would be if my parents were together even though they split up for the benefit of them both. it is sad that I do not have a strong connection with my dad In fact I do not really have a strong connection to anyone as no matter how hard I try or how hard I want to have a conversation with someone it goes barely anywhere and overall I am not very social and it really tears me down. I am also very self conscious and I do not like my looks my thoughts my actions and overall I do not like myself. I would have probably ended it all but I am still young and I do not want to harm my mom or my sister as I am close to them.Also recently my sister said I do not know what I would do if you were not here this really made me think about the impact of my suicide and also about how I tried my best to comfort her when she was self harming which helped her get out of the dark place she was in.I love my mother and sister dearly and they are the reason I am still here. I do not want to be alive but I do not want to be dead,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1400,I will start. I have been having an awful time lately and I do not know if I will be okay anytime soon but this subreddit along with a few others are helping me cope and I feel like I am not alone. I do not have anyone to talk to and it sucks but that is nothing new. How are you guys? how is everyone doing? How are you doing?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1402,The pandemic has completely destroyed my will to live. I have lost interest in everything that I used to like and now actively hate a lot of them. I moved to a new city and have no friends. I have not seen anyone other than my parents in 16 months. I do not have any close friends who I can talk about my feelings to. I have a terrible relationship with my parents. They do not care that I am sad. I tried telling them about my feelings I cried to them. My mom brushed them off and my dad threatened to beat me up in front of all my classmates. I feel left out of everything. My friends are making plans hanging out playing games. I am here struggling through a mountain of workload and suffocating. Toiling through 10 hrs of online classes everyday trying to keep my sanity safe. Everyone I have talked to reacts negatively whenever i try to talk about my feelings. My closest friend accused me of using them after I confessed to them that I am suicidal. I have no motivation to do or learn anything. There is no interest for anything left in me anymore. Everyone tells me that I am to blame for my problems. No one knows what I am going through. No one cares. My friends tell me that I have become bitter. I hate myself so much. I just want to die somehow. I do not want to kill myself. I am too scared to. Thousands of people die everyday why cannot I be one of them? I feel so lonely. A lot of times I have dreams where I meet and hang out with people I love. I am so happy in them. Then I wake up and I am hit with reality that I will not ever be able to meet them again. I hate being alone.I do not think I have depression. I just wanted to post this somewhere because no fucking person is willing to listen and I am so sick of it. I hate it so much. I will get judged hard if I ever tell my feelings to anyone. it is ok if no one can help. I just wanted to speak out. I do not know what is happening. I just want to talk.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1409,So this happened some years ago. When I was about 5 we had a small doggy may be less than 7 months old. Well she got sick and me being just a kid did not have much saying on what needs to be done and it was my first experience with a sick animal so I did not even know what to do I was scared and did not want to lose her. Just thought grownups will make everything right.She did not make it as fever reached her brain back then I did not know what that means. Now 14 years later I have been remembering her for a little over a month. How I could have saved her if I nagged my parents even more might have admitted her to a better vet hospital. She could have been with us now.Idk I kind of want to end stuff I could not save her. She was just a pup. Been crying since a month,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1412,I do not know why. I feel terrible all the time and instead of opening up to friends or family I am rude and push them away. I think I just ended a friendship and it all feels so involuntary. I do not know how to control it anymore. When anyone becomes close at all I panic and just sink away and feel like I am drowning and I am sinking deeper and deeper into the suck. It feels like a leech sucking me dry. I cannot think clearly like I could before I just have a fog and think about dying constantly. I do not know that I want to die but sometimes like I am tied to a railroad track and the train is coming. I just want to enjoy things and feel like a functional person. I think that I might be emotionally draining if I talk with friends or family. I want to feel better Why,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1416,I just really feel like everything I do something wrong happens. And its not something that I can overlook or hope I can push through it. Its always something that completely stomps me from doing anything until the issue is resolved no matter how time consuming or stressful. I am really tired of living like this Life,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1423,I am totally lost I do not know what to do please help me Someone call me please!,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1425,I constantly repeat to myself that I have never really been given a fighting chance. Quite honestly all the odds are against me and I have spent so long fighting and I am just tired. I grew up with abusive parents I am mixed so my mom is a stereotypical Chinese mom. She was brutal in ways a lot of daughters of immigrant parents can relate to physically mentally emotionally. She challenged me a lot academically I started playing piano when I was 3 I was in advanced tutoring ballet I never really got a chance to be a kid. My dad on the other hand is something else hes significantly older than my mom. He had a failed marriage and I was raised along my half sisters I watched them get treated awfully by him until their mom took them away. That caused me to have a lot of abandonment issues. My dad is not a good person. Hes very religious and abuses it. He raised me teaching me I am an object to fulfill male desire and pleasure and to create children. I was taught about purity and how my destiny is to make my husband happy save my body for him and create children. These teachings began when I was old enough to comprehend and continue even now. Its traumatizing and this has caused me to develop sexual triggers concerning my anxiety and OCD diagnoses. Its made iy impossible for me to have healthy relationships or have sex. I feel like my body and my heart are broken. It does not help that he sexualized me significantly while also teaching me to hate my body. It confused me. he would hit me a lot but he would do it while saying he loved me. I am just really confused. I was under a lot of pressure in every area my parents are successful business people they trained me to adhere to productivity culture. they would always tell me I am on my own and need to learn to work. When I was 10 I got severely ill. Auto immune disease. It was very severe and I was practically living in hospitals until I was 14. I could not go to school I lost the majority of my friends. I had tried extreme diets chemotherapy steroids I had a feeding type for two years and ultimately had a surgery to remove an organ. During the times I was really sick the abuse and mistreatment would stop and as sick as it sounds Id almost be thankful for being unwell so I would not be hurt so badly. My illness made me so mad though. Ever since I was 8 Id tell myself every day 10 more years you can run away you will be out of here you will be independent just make it to 18 my illness resulted in a physical disability and since its autoimmune I live with the fear iy could come back at any time now I am forever dependent on my parents for money and health insurance and I can never be free from them. I am so angry about this all I ever wanted was to be free and that caused me to not be. I am interested in psychology I read a lot of research surrounding trauma and I know very well that my illness could be a direct because of the abuse. I guess my soul just could not take it I feel weak. Every time Id get better the abuse would begin again. we have had cps visits lots of people are concerned. My parents made up a lie I have autism so when teachers or health care providers are worried about how anxious I am amongst other signs of abuse they have something to cover it up with. They say they have always suspected me to have autism they try to convince me to fake certain traits when they take me in for testing. I know better and I know what its all about. I feel like a lot of people failed me. Eventually when I got smart enough to get help on my own my parents told me of how my illness can come at any time and if I were to leave and go to foster care they would not be able to help me get the best medical care. And at times I need constant medical care. A really difficult situation as you can see. Before I could tell myself 18 and I am gone and all of a sudden I did not even know if that is possible anymore. Eventually I got better do go surgery and I was able to be fully normal again I went back to school made a lot of friends and developed a plan to become financially stable by the time I am 18. I was not allowed to go out hardly ever while I was sick I could never leave home and they would punish me in ways such as taking away electronics wifi books etc. so Id be forced to be in a room with no distractions at all. I knew these punishments could come back so I had to think smart. I began building a persona and platform online through different social media platforms. I marketed myself as a teen creator photography fashion etc. like an influencer basically. More than anything I value my privacy and I know how sad my life is so I hated portraying a happy teenager online I never wanted to be influencer I just wanted a platform so when the time came I could use it to create a business. Over time I built a big platform I was featured in publications I had brand deals I was even invited to prestigious events. This did not result in much money just experience. you would think Id be proud of my accomplishments but I am not at all. I regret it more than anything I hated being a 15 year old essentially selling myself like a product online. Getting myself into situations and events filled with adults. I feel embarrassed for all the danger I put myself in online. I wish I could have still been able to be a kid. I kept pushing and pushing myself my new endeavor was writing a book about my experiences as a teen influencer and my illness and such. I should not have done this. I spent a year doing this it was essentially shadow work. By the end of it I realized how sad my life was how all of this was not the result of passion or ambition just a desperate attempt of freedom. As a teenager I was never allowed to drive. I am turning 18 in a few days I still cannot drive. I cannot go anywhere without permission if I try to leave my house my parents call the cops on me which incites a panic attack. They know this and claim my panic attacks are of a mentally unstable person needing to go to a psyche ward. Everyone I know tells me I remind them of Britney Spears its sad. When covid quarantine was announced it was the worst day of my life. No one understood why I was freaking out so much they did not realize that all my life I had been subject to extreme lockdowns. Not being able to leave my house being stuck with them I knew what it was like to never leave the house a house filled with so much awfulness. It was happening again. I had already realized how I wanted to step away from my online platform after realizing the real reason I did all of this. My parents are high risk as well as me so they went extreme for quarantine. Since March 2020 up until may 2021 I was being held captive in my home. We had security systems set with a password only my mom knew I could never leave. If I left my room I risk having a panic attack or being yelled at ao I stayed in my room for almost a year with no other human contact. all I had was social media this is awful for mental health and I am now left with severe depression anxiety and ocd. I had a boyfriend at the time he was my first love my everything really. We started dating a year before lockdown we only got serious a few months prior though. To say he was a miracle in my life is an understatement. Before him I did not even know what love was or how I deserved to be treated I had no idea what normal human kind interactions of love were I had not even been able to cry for 5 years. He opened my heart up he helped me understand all that had happened to me and how it was not my fault. He knew how much I went through and how much I was going through he put his life on hold to help me feel as comfortable as I could while I was stuck in the house. he would stay on the phone with me every day he would plan virtual movie dates he would write me letters he would stay on the phone while I napped or slept to make sure I did not have nightmares he would drop off gifts and food for me. Lockdown meant everyone working from home in my house and all food and grocerys delivered it was intense. For a year and a half. during this time my friends all grew up they are indecent now and although I still have close friends we drifted. My boyfriend was the only one who stayed by me helping me with everything. This time period caused me to decline mentally a lot I took out all my anger at him I was so mean to him Id yell at him. I have ocd and because it is triggered by my fathers teachings it can make me think I do not love my boyfriend or it can make me think he has hurt me physicallysexuallymentally etc. Id take out all my frustration on him. I was not a good girlfriend. He stayed by me though so patient never yelled never fought back he treated me with all the kindness I could have hoped to have when I was young. He knew how much I had been hurt and was still being hurt so he started working jobs to save up money to get me out once I turn 18 he contacted family to help him and help me. I felt guilty him giving up his future for me. But he really did love me he just wanted me to be happy and be there to see it. He knew about my disability and sickness he would help take care of me too. In January a lot of family issues arose tragedies and death. I started spiraling then I was overwhelmed unbelievably overwhelmed I do not know exactly what happened a depressive episode maybe manic episode I do not know. I broke up with my boyfriend out of no where. A mix of the guilt and just idk I knew it was a mistake he was the only good thing in my life and my way out of this family but I broke up with him. Its been 7 months we talk every day I want him back I tell him that but I hurt him so much I gave up on him when he never gave up on me. Its too late for anything now hes back on track with a new career plan and hes doing amazing. I am not. After I broke up with him I launched a online business reading astrological charts for people I made an insane amount of money utilizing my social platforms. It robbed me of the passion I had for my hobby with astrology though really burned me out. During quarantine to pass time I also became a certified doula. Youngest to become one from the program I trained with. I have no patience I worked day and night to create my business materials and it failed never got work except for birth fetishizers that scammed me into talking about birth with them. Sick traumatizing. This episode I had caused me to shut off emotion I was unhinged just working my ass off just like before I met my boyfriend investing all my energy into work. Then I had a wake up call realized how unhappy and miserable I am having to conform to hustle entrepreneurial ship culture just for freedom. I want to drive I want to get a job outside. I want to go to school. I do not want this I do not want this at all. I am allowed to go out now but every time I do I get panic attacks. Being in isolation for so long causes you to get overwhelm very easily. I can hardly function. My friends are all going to college now I wanted to take a gap year to heal but I still have no independence. I lost it all I lost everything or maybe I just had nothing to begin with. My birthday is in a week. I get something I call birthday blues every birthday I feel so depressed and borderline suicidal. Most of my birthdays in my childhood were traumatic it would be a peak day of abuse and such so now every birthday I just wish I was dead. This one is going to be the worse. I spent my whole life looking forward to turning 18. It was going to be the day I am free. Its not anymore. That was my only goal I told myself this every day ever single fucking day and now I am turning 18 with absolutely nothing. Nothing. I have nothing. I fought for this long and for what. For absolutely nothing. I thought last year would be my worst birthday. My then boyfriend knew I would not be allowed out even if its just outside to say hi. So he created a big surprise for me full of my favorite things and left it outside for me all I wanted to do was bring it in and get my flowers and balloons. I love flowers and balloons and I realized a new security system had been set and I was now completely trapped in the house. My dad was crowding around me he scares me a lot I have not talked to him in over a year I cannot without panicking. Hes scary. I ran to my room and sobbed all I wanted was to get my flowers and balloons. I locked myself in my room and cried all day just like every year. My boyfriend was on the phone though. he would sing to me and tell me stories to help calm me down. Hes not here anymore and no one else is either. My friends are all living their own grown up lives now. Its just me now. And I told myself for years that all I had to do was turn 18 and it would be over. Now its worse than ever. I feel hopeless I have never been happy in my life I live in isolation I feel like I am being held captive. I have lost everything. I never had anything to begin with.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1433,will i ever be noticed? is my life worth anything? i spend all day doing nothing full of sorrow and pain while wishing pain on others. i waste my time day after day after day slowly killing myself mentally. the isolation is killing me. i have no one to talk to about it it feels like I am going to hurt myself or someone else but I am too afraid to act on it solely because i do not want to go back to the mental hospital. who am i? why am i here? what is my point anymore? i do not want to waste away like this i work so hard to get better my days always start off promising but go to shit quickly. it feels like life itself is playing me like a fiddle why though? what did i do to deserve this pain? I have been like this since i was a mere toddler so why me? did i commit a major sin in my past life? was there a past life? i do not know anymore. i wanted to grow up to help people to be a leader to change peoples lives for the better but now i will not be anything. at most ill be homeless at worst ill be dead but is it really that bad? is it bad to lose my life anymore? nobody would miss me. i destroyed all of my relationships. i only have my mother i love my mother she is been through so much she is so strong and I am so proud of her but i do not think i want to continue to live like this. i just want to escape i cannot embrace this life anymore for it has brought me to my knees. nobody would miss me. i do not care anymore. i will not even miss myself. I am just too afraid to go through with it i do not have a gun i do not have anything of that sort so what do i do? i do not feel like a human. i feel subhuman i feel like nothing why was i born this way WHY? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO? I DID NOTHING. I JUST WANTED A NICE AND SAFE JOURNEY BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO GO INSANE FROM ISOLATION. this is not even mentioning all of the voices and stuff i see its probably due to loneliness i hear people calling my name a comforting girls voice a girl i do not even know a girl i will never know. right before i sleep i am haunted with the noises of people saying my name as if I am at my deathbed. i know it is unrealistic though. because no one would miss me in reality. I am a nobody i do nothing to help other people I have been a mental cripple my entire life. its only become apparent recently when all of my friendships came falling down solely because i am a horrible friend and horrible narcissistic degenerate of a person in general. this is not even the worst I have felt last night was when i cried harder than I have ever cried i had to cover my mouth to prevent screaming i do not want my mom to worry about me. my mom deserves everything for how hard she works for me even after my dad died. i know my dad would be sad if i go through with killing myself but hes not here anymore hes in a better place. i know that my life is going to get worse from here my teenage years have just started and it feels like i am really losing my mind. do i deserve this? is this because of all my past mistakes? i do not know and i will not ever know. what hurts most is that everyone i know would tell me how much i change that i was not the same funny happy helpful me. that is what my friend told me right before we stopped talking. I am such a selfish fucking bitch. i always talk about other people not being empathetic but i myself am not empathetic and only paint myself to be so other people feel bad am i really just this bad of a person? is all I am looking for a reaction from everyone so that i can finally know they care or make them care? i do not know. i do not know answers to any of this. i feel like I am going insane with all these thoughts flowing around my head there is nothing that calms them anymore i am just filled with negative emotions and i have no way to control them. i know i will never be off meds. last time i was i was crying harder than i have ever cried and i had the worst homicidal thoughts. at this point its a struggle to keep myself from hurting myself and others. i bet it would be a lot better for everyone if i was gone nobody would be hurt. thank you if you read this whole thing. accumulation of my thoughts.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1434,i do not need advice it will not help. my life has been horrible since i was a young my father died and my mother was abusive my entire life growing up i just want to die without feeling pain as I am very afraid of pain from my past of being abused will someone please tell me how to kill myself without feeling pain for long i just want to rest please. i have no friends i spend my entire days watching tv shows and playing games to try and detach myself from the real world anytime i stop doing that all i can think of is how much i hate myself and living everything is lonely and it hurts. someone please just tell me how to leave I am tired of everyone telling me to stay and that things get better when all they have done is get progressively worse the past 16 years i wish i knew a painless way to kill myself,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1445,And that i will not have a good life that ill alway regret thing's that i did not do or committed to.It feel like I am my greatest weakness and i cannot do anything i do not commit I am lazy and when i had phone counselling i alway felt negative before feeling like I am just there just to feel like I am helping myself but I am not.I could get therapy session but i feel like it is pointless.This make me empty alone and that I am too far gone that my life is over it feel like i have so many problems yet it feel like i do not have any or that they are too small.These past couple of days are just me escaping and ignoring my problem.

1446,Suicidal thoughts in my head do not know how to let go. Lost in my head as time flies by with no one at my side. Stress eating away at my bones. Mind slowly decaying in the madness.

Empty on the inside nothing but a black hole. do not know if Ill ever feel something real. life is pointless. what is the point of this pain and suffering. I just Smoke the pain away every night but still left with these thoughts of suicide and knowing death is the end of everything no pain no sadness just peace. I am so alone I do not know how much longer I can go on like this. i want to break my hand sometimes or crash my car just to feel something. I wished I would have died on that highway last year but I guess I am still here who knows for how long. Suicidal thoughts,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1449,I have tried to reach out for help over small things over the years. I have tried in person I have tried the government I have tried my parents .

I am not actively seeking death or what not but i feel okay if i were to be gone tmr. after all what is the point? unable to envision my future,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1456,For the past 6 months I have been completely unable to make connections with people no matter how much I may want to. I am filled with rage and pessimism at the very thought of trusting someone. I feel like a parrot in social situations not contributing anything but just doing my best which is still not very good to mimic the emotions of the person that I am talking to. I have been depressed before but never this angry and just broken to the core. I have contemplated ending it all often these past few months because it seems that I hit a dead end everywhere I go and everyone I love and trust abandons me. I have some PTSD from my childhood as well which just makes me feel more broken and hopeless. I cannot make connections with people anymore,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1461,Hi Reddit. I just want to write down some thoughts about this night and I do not know where I can write it down. The last days and weeks were pretty rough. I was in a psychiatric hospital to stabilize my mood in a suicidal crisis for about 4 weeks. My Mum pressured to release me from the clinic because I have so much things to do. I will be getting 18 in under two weeks. So I have to go to many doctor appointments and to the city hall etc. So I was released from the hospital. In the hospital I made the promise to myself that I would never ever say to my therapists or anyone else that has not been in this situation that I am permanently suicidal and think of it every time. Because then they are putting me in the closed section or even give me permanent contact to a nurse which means you are not even allowed to go to the toilet alone. Just imagine having your peroid and changing your tampon or pad whilst someone is watching you.... But one of the worst parts is that you have nothing else to do as sitting in your room with a bed and a closed closet and a chair with a table. You may have a book or a little thing you will entertain yourself with. You are so bored. Occaisonally you are allowed to be in the group room which has a tv and a radio and some games. But only if you have not said that you are suicidal even though you are not about to kill yourself. You are so bored that you only think about how to get out of that situation. Either you successfully kill yourself or you do not say anybody something or you try to get better. So I think I have made the point why I do not want to tell my therapist about anything related to suicide. As I was released from the hospital I got my subscription for Fluoxetine and I take it. One ajor issue for me is that if I have stress with my mum i only can cope with cutting myself. It has gotten so deep that i had to get stitches so I had to tell my mum because she is the only one who has custody of me and the hospital is only allowed to sew my wound if she approves it. So I had to tell her. She does not know for sure that all of my scars and wounds from self harming come beacause she and I were having fights. That would be devastating for her after all she has done to me according to her point. She thinks she has done so many things and that I should be happy about having her as a parent. But I cannot. She pissed of my father so he never saw me and he committed suicide because of it. She has made so much debts thet I will inherit her debts she has not been there for me regarding emotional things and has not been establishing a stable relationship towards me. And that is just a little selction. I mean she tries it especially concerning physical things. I can learn Instruments and i can go to a swimming club I can go onto camps with the church etc. And everytime I say to her that she was not there for me she points out the physical things. I have said to her that I have very strong suicidal thoughts and she did nothing. After I tried it she was shouting to me. She made me feel unloved. Because I have noone. I have friends that I can go to but what should they do? They arewere also kids. I would be such a big burden to them. And teachers you might say? I can not trust anybody because nobody ever helped me when I said that I needed help. The first time I was admitted to the hospital a teacher which I had for over 8 years came to me since my notes and appearance and turnins dropped. She asked me and she saw that I was not good. She came to me. She said that she sees that i am not alright. And as my first reflex was to tell her that I am ok she said that I am not. And then she said I am not myself. I am not ok. And then I borke down. Finally after over 12 Years someone noticed that I am not alright. I was not ablle to play my role. I could not hide my depression anymore. I seemed to function on the surface but she noticed the subtle signs. She came to me when i could not come to her and she had not slacked her efforts. My Mum on the other hand Ignored me for 3 montsh straight did not talk to me did not come into my room to ask how i am going. Nothing. She did not care. She does not care. The whole time I was in school I dreamt about my teachers being my parents. It was clear for met that they are different as parents and that they never could be but it was my dream. I wished myself a stable person which loved me emotionally and that would be older than me. That could take care of when I could not. I was jealous of the teachers kids. I was jealous of my friends. Because they had both parents. One has splitted parents but he sees both of them regularly. Back to the topic I am cutting myself because of stress with my mum and me feeling alone an being not worthy of love. Btw her love was not unconditional it was coupled to not say anything against her etc. We had a dispute about my future as a voulnteer and she shouted to me. I went in my room and tried to calm myself. I tried to say that this was just a booboo and it would not happen again that she will hate me. But I could not. I have fear about the future. And other things going around so I am clearly on the edge with my emotions. I cut myself deeply i had to get stitches. On wednesday we had another confrontation. I have not spoken to her since then. Everyday I cut myself. This night my cuttingsession was 2 hours long. never have I ever cut so long and so much. I have cut my wrist my thigh my arm my foot my tummy. Normally i just cut my thigh and every now and then my arm. I think some wounds should get medical attention but I can not. I have no will to get out of bed. And then my mum has to be noticed. The one thing that bothers me the most is that she has never excused herself for anything. She never exscused herself for being late for not keeping agreements for lying to me for anything. And I think she never will. Because she says I have to be grateful that she gifted me with the life and so on. But I do not want to live.... Thanks that I can write it down here. At least I would be pleased when it would not get deleted nobody has to read this. I just wanted it to be written down. But if you have read this thanks for hearing me. This night is pretty hard.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1462,My twin betrayed me and it cost me some of my vision. I have no one to talk to besides my mom. I really want to be held but no one loves me that way. I just got rejected by someone who never really cared anyways. I just need to hear positivity to get me through today. It will take 7 years if I am lucky to get my eyes back. I am REALLY trying to see the positives. I wish I could sleep till then because sleeping is the only escape from reality right now. I cannot even run away from my problems. I need some positive words please,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1468,I feel like i want to die i need my dad. I do not understand how this happened. This all feels like a dream It hurtsb,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1469,I cannot do anything right. I keep doing what I believe is the right thing to do and it ALWAYS is the wrong thing. Why try and do anything why even be a live if everything I do is wrong... I wish I did not exist... I am tired of trying... I cannot live with another people because as soon I get criticise my mind goes back to I cannot do anything right. I want help but I do not know what would even help at this point in my stupid pointless life. Maybe I should just kill myself... I cannot do anything right,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1473,My 30's have come to an awful start. I lost a 5 year relationship I have no family left I got about 3 friends who are doing their own thing and I just feel so alienated and lonely anymore. I thought I had a handle on things for a while I thought I had something to work for and something to hang on to but I really do not. I am delaying the inevitable and I think honestly would be the best time to take myself out of this world. Anything I have attached myself to or put work into has been a dismal failure. I do not see things getting much better for me. I will always have PTSD I will always feel alienated I will always need fucking braces to walk I will always feel like something good that happens in my life will end in the worst possible way. I feel just alienated and done with it all.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1476,But no one else would be able to replace him so no one else can have my heart..Being on my own is killing me but I would rather be alone than make new memories with anyone else.. Being alone sucks and hurts like hell,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1480,Where do I start. I am in my mid 20s I come from an extremely repressive Muslim family and I still live with them I have been set up in 4 failed arranged marriages I am not allowed to leave the house wearing what I want I am living with 2 disabled parents who neglected me my entire life that have done a whole lot to parentify me. My older sister escaped and ran away at 17 nearly ten years ago and I wish I did the same but the burden and responsibility to take care of my parents fell on my hands from a young age of 16. I have no friends no resources. My parents are both uneducated. My other family members get violent toward me. my rapist is in prison and my stalker will not stop harassing me with false police reports. I also have broken a few hearts so I am scared of my exes knowing where I live. Sometimes I am too terrified to leave the house. Since my parents are uneducated and never worked and only were on disability raising us in poverty and never trying I cannot ask them for career advice. I am the only one with a college education and I still have to thank my guidance counselors for helping me every step of the way but even then I was scared to be too needydependent and ask them for help because I was always abused growing up and my existence feels like a burden. Sorry for rambling. People tell me to get a job here but people do not understand that a job means being trapped in that location. I tell people I want to work elsewhere but they keep shutting me down telling me to start small where I live. But the desire to leave is urgent for my physical and mental wellbeing. My point is People constantly tell me why do you want to work in ? Different state you can just do that in New Jersey. Stay there. Be around your family. This is what makes my blood boil. Its hard to figure out how to tell people that this place is dead to me and Ill probably end up dying here if I was to stay any longer. I do not know how to tell people that I am ready to move on and spread my wings because there is this huge back story that nobody knows. I tend to hold the weight of this on my own. How can I do that? I want to mostly leave for my safety and for a new beginning. I cannot stay here much longer. Anyway to tell these people? I am horrible at communicating my points so this is why I need help. I want to leave I am done living here. I wish others stopped telling me to stay.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1483,I just wish that life was different. My life is not even that bad on the outside I have a great family I live in a decent area I do not really have many external struggles and when I say that I do not mean to brag I am simply saying it for a little bit of context. I am 19 years old and for as long as I can remember I have just had this emptiness inside of me. I do not like to talk about it a lot with the people around me but it really is something that just eats at me. It feels like there is no middle ground for my emotions. One minute I can feel like life is great and the next I just wish I had not been born in the first place. I just wish I was not here. I have felt this way since I would say I was around 11 or 12. It feels like any bit of happiness I get is just a temporary high but I always come down and sink into this dark place that I cannot crawl out of. No matter what I just always end up finding myself in this pit. I just think of how I wish none of this had ever happened I could have just not been born. I think about suicide a lot but its not something I truly want to act on. Its not that I want to die I do not truly want to die I just wish Id never been here. I am not necessarily afraid of death it feels like I am just kind of waiting for it to happen. I would not search for it but I am also not afraid of it happening. Id like to think that it would be comforting to know that everything just goes away. It would just be over. No more stress no more sadness no more worrying about this or that just the peaceful notion that I do not have to deal with anything anymore. Does anybody else feel this way? I am tired of living a day to day life and feeling like I am trapped in this reality I want nothing to do with. I just want to be at peace. I just wish it had never happened in the first place. I just wish it was over,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1487,TLDR these are ramblings may or may not make sense. I am just extremely tired.If you have any advice for this Id love to hear it. Not even sure what would help at this point.I just had a realization. I am the quiet kid the one everyone is secretly scared of. I play songs about suicide in front of people nodding along to it like its a goddamn Christmas carol. I am exactly like my dad was this age and have had a son a lot longer being the only one actually present in my little brothers life as he was growing up even if a lot of it was us fighting for moms attention. And I do not know why I am feeling so much spite for my mother tonight. Though it might have been due to last year when she kicked me out of the house for being too sick and not able to lift and move a destroyed 20ft she would for her even though earlier that day she saw me outside soon after the generic natural disaster sawing trees that had fallen across the driveway. Then having to come in and lay down because I could barely breathe and was sweating beads. I am thinking it might have been COVID19. Subsequently spending the night in the bed of my 91 5speed ranger with knob windows and key locks loved that truck but after the damage from that storm insurance totaled it. Now I almost feel like she has whether purposely or accidentally raised me to be a massive simp. Id venture to say having a giant mom complex that spreads to every girl I am attracted to. Where it is now to the point where I am taking care of her 14 year old son. but not able to provide what he needs as I am at work all day and hes with friends most afternoons. While she is trying to live her best life 2 and a half hours away. More power to people doing that I am just salty from having to play dad since the age of 6. And I have silently been loathing her since getting kicked out like I have always done to my dad. Speaking of which Id say its almost like a spiteful competition. Where I always have to be better than him silently protesting the worthiness he never gave me. Sorry that one looks like a grammar question from the ACTSAT. I am getting help with the mental issues that I am sure are obvious by now. But I just feel like I am a fuckup and it got a lot worse once I realized I am exactly like my dad. I failed life already time for game over. If you have gotten this far sorry for having to read this. I am going to go to bed now NOT kmsing. Tired ramblings,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1489,because I always want to fucking kms I sexually identify as a unit of speed,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1492,I do not have any plans to kill myself but I wish I was not around anymore. I feel like a failure. I have done so many stupid things and been so mean due to my alcoholism.My calls me every day visits me rubs my back takes me out to eat. I feel like do not deserve to have her as my mom.I sometimes just wish something would happen to me. I know my family would miss me but I feel like they would be better off without me causing them stress.I feel like I have nothing going for me. I do not want to be here anymore,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1495,HiI am a 28 year old she will of a man from the UK suffering with severe depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment now I am what I call stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day I have been stuck alive too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything believe anything want anything feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair I know this is happening I just cannot stop it meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a fulltime alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself I am openminded but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore prepandemic I was doing my dream job still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available being mistreated at each company of course I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our preexisting issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted I do not need money I just want fulfillment I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem! Maybe I am??? Am I Dead?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1496,anyone else who is attempted sewerslide feel such guilt for putting your loved ones through that? it weights heavily on my shoulders daily its a weight that makes my depression worse a vicious cycle. guilt after attempts,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1498,Everybody hates me. My roommate who is supposed to be my best friend hates me. She will not admit it but she does. We do not do anything fun together. We do not spend any time together. We just coexist or we are fighting. I think she is grown to resent me more and more as time has went on. Its just another failed friendship. Another thing I fucked up. Without her I do not have any friends. Even my dog likes Erin more. She always wants to spend time with her and not with me. She never wants to be around me. I am a bad trainer and owner. I have no one to talk to. Everyone is tired of listening to me. They get mad or frustrated or depressed or anxious if I talk about how I feel. I have a therapist but I only talk to her for an hour a week and it does not really help anyways. Even my parents do not want to listen anymore. I should just shut up. I should just not exist at all. I do not have any friends or any reason to live. I keep trying but its all useless. I wish I was dead. I wish I never existed. I am tired of feeling so alone and tired and useless and like a failure all the time. I am tired of fighting every day. I am so tired. I am never going to be good enough. I am never going to be loved. I just want it all to stop I do not have anything new or interesting to say,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1500,For some reason or anotherI am here. I exist.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1504,All I want to see now is the world end. I hope all life gets wiped and everything on this planet dies. I am sick of seeing the suffering in everyday life. If there was a button to make everything on this planet disappear I would press it. The bad in life outweighs the good in it. I want to die with the worldI'm sorry I just wanted to get this off my chest. Yup I am beyond saving. I am mentally damaged,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1510,I am 20. I do not understand why I am alive to be honest. I do not have any intention of killing myself but I find it hard to care about anything these days. And from what I can tell life itself seems meaningless overall. Not to be nihilistic or anything but I genuinely see no reason to even keep going. Most of the time I do not feel anything besides meh. or I seem apathetic. I am content being alone and I am the kind of person who is happy as long as I have any kind of something around me to entertain myself with. As it currently stands my depression seems to have taken a nosedive. I have not showered in 3 days because I do not feel like it. We also do not have any hot water at the moment and so if I do shower I have to do it in the stupidest way possible and I do not even feel clean afterwards. Basically I was taught when this happens boil water mix it with some cool water pour it in sink and use a washcloth to wipe yourself down. Stupid and takes way more effort than a regular shower. And I do not feel like taking a cold shower. And I mean realistically if I died tomorrow nobody would notice for a long time. Not even work because I work minimum wage and they would just assume I would quit or something. My grandparents do not need me. My parents do not care where I am or what I am doing they are busy raising my siblings or getting high. it is been like that since I was a baby though. My grandparents would find my body if I were to die and probably be sad but I feel like that is only because of the fact they raised me. They would actually benefit if I was gone seeing as to how often they complain about how miserable their life currently is. How broke they are ect. I feel like I do not really exist except to make them happy because I am always their emotional support child. They argue and yell all the time. Just this morning my grandpa decided to start an argument because my grandma grabbed the wrong bowl. She said she wished she had never left my aunts houseShe went to visit last week and my grandpa said he wished she stayed too. Then of course she comes into my room crying then she makes my favorite meal then comes to announce that she made my favorite meal and then let us herself into my room to make my bed. This stuff is her way of trying to make herself feel better it is not out of genuine love I do not think. Because if I am in a bad mood and I do not immediately perk up it must be her fault and she will start crying even more. there is no escape from the negativity. I have to fake my happiness obviously because her feelings depend on mine. I hate it and there is no escape from the negativity.I mean I found roommates that hopefully I will be moving out with soon. But even then I am not sure life will get any better. Because I am pathetic enough that most people think there is something wrong with me and see me as a walking red flag. I am of course poor as well so you know add that onto it. But I have been saving up my money. I just do not know what to do with any of it. I have been saying I want to go to college but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And I do not know why I would go to college yet I do not want to waste my money on something I might never use or might not even like. There are a lot of people out there who view me as a loser because I smoke weed play video games work and am not in college. To add onto that everyone acts like you should strive to better yourselfBut in my opinion I am not sure what I should better about myself. Or why. To make it so I am more tolerable to you? Because if I do not see you putting in the same effort why would I put in all the work so you can freeload? If that makes sense. I mean I am just here to vent at the moment. But I am not really upset. Or sad even. I am not sure what I am feeling but it is neither hopeless nor hopeful. I do not see a reason to keep going,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1512,As the days go on I get more and more numb at the thought of suicide. Its Thursday and I have been numb since Sunday. I went to the beach at night and I just wanted to jump in so bad. Right in front of my friends. Monday I slept all day and thought about what I would put in my note. At least I made something. Tuesday I could not sleep and when I took my daily meds I had a horrifying episode. I went to the mental hospital but of course they would not take me. I talked with my friends but I just felt like a burden the whole time. Why does everything always have to be about me. Wednesday I try to recover from my injuries from the day before. Partner buys me medical supplies to help and then gets upset because he does not know how to support me. We contemplate breaking up. Today is Thursday woke up fine. Crocheting my friends stuffed frogs as a thank you for being my friend gift. I already said I wanted to die in the group chat to no response I guess they thought I was joking. I reach out to my partner and tell him I am going back to bed because I cannot handle life today. No response. I guess I fucked that up too. I am so alone. Nobody wants anything to do with me because I am a burden. Praying that one of my friends or even my partner reaches out to me for comfort. I need it so bad I feel lost and alone with nowhere to go but bed. Maybe I just need to face the fact that I will always be alone no matter what. Its been so long,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1519,Pls i need help. I cannot take it no more Counseling,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1520,everything is awful. I am so tired i cannot even explain how fucking awful it is. I am so tired,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1523,Two weeks after the kickout notification.I lost in the 'endgame'. My professor refused my days of begging and the kickout is confirmed. Now I am going to be detained in the military service hell for having that fckin dck. Just should had the hormone therapy and testicle removal surgery but I could not.Everything in my future is seasoned with shit. No positive factors anymore in my life. One more step and then I am over. I lost every single hope. I want to die.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1531,I have suffered from depression for over 10 years now as well as cptsd due to my mothers abuse. I am also autistic and queer I suffer from chronic pain and I am poor despite working 60 hours a week on call but when you are basically an informal area manager with lowlevel employee pay....I was seeing a psychiatrist for 10 years but I never really told him anything substantial because my mother was also his patient and even with HIPAA I felt that she could easily learn things about me I needed her not to know. I finally cut her out of my life but to do so I had to move 6 hours away from all of my family and friends and I could not afford to see the psych anymore. I could not even afford health insurance. Due to that I have been unmedicated and out of therapy for 5 or so years now.Now I am more financially stable and looking for a psych andor therapist to help me process my trauma and help me to be a functioning member of society. I have reached out to 6 different people and only one agreed to see me with one of them even explicitly denying me because were a system. However all she did was push anxiety apps and meditation at me then she forgot about me after two months of seeing her.I feel like were untreatable. This is never going to get better. I have not self harmed in a few years and have not seriously considered suicide in even longer but now those thoughts are coming back. I have been bursting into tears for no reason at least 10 times a day and I am plagued by nightmares about my mother finding me. Yesterday my grandma who partially raised me begged me to call my mom and I snapped at her and today I found out she is in the hospital. Things are only getting worse. I do not want to die but I do not know what else to do. My spouse does not know how to support me and my only IRL friend is having her own problems. I am stuck on a steady decline. Considering relapse or worse at this point,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1534,I cannot handle this I just cannot I do not know what to do at this point I dropped going to school forfew years now last every single friend I ever had my family never talks to me and know nothing about me I push everyone away I cannot handle being around people and dread going out I alway smile and make stupid jokes but as soon as I get back to my room I sit in the dark and put something on the tv most of the time something animated since its feels like a break from reality then just lay they all day and night feeling empty randomly crying I tried cutting my self and it did nothing but put scars over me I attempted a few times now and most of the times did nothing or just made me feel like shit I think I am going to end it all soon after I complete something off my bucket list I cannot handle this I have no one at all to talk to for the last few years or to even text I am only ever on my phone at this point to search something up but never more then an hour a day I am trying to get a job to save up money to do a few thing before I end it but have not been very motivated i see my self hating everything i liked before and feeling like even my own family seem like stranger i kept trying to tell my self it just because I am young and do not understand anything then that it was the drugs causing it but then i stopped doing them and nothing change i should be going into 11th grade but my parents not going to make me like that did not make me 710th I cannot even To recconect with old freinds since I moved and deleted there contact information any sorry for rumbling doubt anyone cares or read it just wanted to have something somewhere that proves that I existed I am fading away,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1537,My little brother has been and will always be my world. He grew up privileged with two loving parents who did everything for him. I grew up with the same parents. My mom and I no longer get along but we used to be very close. My dad was emotional verbally and physically abusive towards me all throughout my teen years. My brother told me I should not talk about it to people because it tarnished my parents name. That they took care of me fed me clothes me took me on vacation. While I recognize my father feels guilty for how he treated me he has NEVER apologized and has not made any effort to be in my life. I do not see why I need to protect someone who never really protected me. I feel like once again I am being considered as overemotional and that my feelings pain or my experience is not valid. Yes my father is not the same person but that does not change my nightmares about him nor my PTSD. Today is the first night in a while I felt worthless And did not want to fight any longer. I have my loving husband in my corner but that is it. I love so deeply. Why cannot others love me. One person I never expected,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1539,I do not know what to do anymore I have already spent alot of money for treatments and check ups doctors does not seem to know what is going on lol nothing seems to cure me i cannot even keep up with my job anymore because of my illness and also my relationship with my so is going thru a rough patch because i feel like a burden and sometimes i break up with him because i want him to live life happily not with me which is miserable but he still stays despite the consequences that i told him it cannot be helped until I am cured it is so hard no one even understands my pain sometimes i just want to consider suicide but I do not want to be selfish My undiagnosed chronic illness and miserable life,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1550,so you are telling me it is a solution ! My reaction to suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem will always be the same.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1551,I am officially done being nice. From now on I am going to to be an asshole jerk selfish and I am not going to help others if I do not want to care about others or do the things I do not want to anymore. I used to think that being nice was the way to like correctly but oh boi was I wrong. People are assholes and they live better than I do and they seem to be carefree so now I will do the same. Being a good guy has literally gotten me nowhere In life I thought I would have much more to show by now but nope.I guess I will see how this goes cannot really go anymore downhill from here. Being kind caring compassionate and a nice person has gotten me nowhere,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1552,I will admit idk what the fuck is wrong with me. Ever since I was young I have had the thought of killing myself. I have never had any motivation or sense of purpose for anything good. My thought process for years now has been that it is my destiny to kill myself. I am 22 now and I am about to fail university I have got no life skills for the working world so I am not prepared for life. Tbh I am not a hard worker either. I have never had anything to complain about I do not live a bad life all my issues are my own and are caused by me. I am extremely jealous of others and I am constantly ashamed of myself for not being good enough. The truth is some people are destined to be great people with amazing talents. Other people like me a destined to be lazy and waste their life until they decide to kill themselves. So that is what I am going to do because nothing will change the fact that deep down all I am is a lazy piece of shit who is full of hate and I cannot be arsed with anything anymore. I am just tired of living as a human I hate being conscious I cannot fucking handel it anymore. Do you know what it is like to constantly be thinking of suicide your entire life everyday do you know how much that shapes your every choice because you believe every year will be your last? To look in the mirror everyday and see nothing but a failure? It sends me fucking crazy because one second I can appreciate how beautiful life is then the next all I can think about it killing myself. It sends me crazy because I am so angry with myself for not being stronger and just changing myself. I wish my stupid fucking parents could of kept it in their trousers. I feel like I am mentally prepping for my suicide,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE

1581,I have never felt so low in my life. I wish there was an easy way to kill myself like just falling asleep and then never waking up again.

1607,I miss her so much. We hurt each other but she really fucked me up. Smoking a pack a day eating pills more than food. I am lost and there is no one to find me. What am I looking for? An end. I tried to find it multiple times and it never worked. My entire life has been filled with heartache death and all sorts of fucked up shit. I feel like this ends with me. I always told myself my resilience came from carrying my two brothers in my heart so they could live on through my memories. If I die 3 people die. It will not be a suicide it will be me killing their memories and myself. I do not even want help I want to find peace. I miss her so much. I hate that she was the remedy because that was way too much pressure to place on her. I never told her that she was the cure she knew it I am sure. I hate how we ended things and I cannot reach out to her now even if I wanted. she will never come to look because I am the last thing she wants to see.

1609,I have a huge problem with self sabotage. I cannot enjoy life. My issues are on my mind 100 of the time. If they are not in the forefront then they are in the background. I distract myself from life using my phone and television. Every time I feel like life is going good I just get anxiety about how its all going to come crashing down and that I do not deserve happiness. I work in customer service and am really good at putting on a fake smile and playing the part of a really happy and pleasant person. But I cannot keep it up for the people in my life that I love. I feel like a huge burden to anyone I am attached to. I fuck it all up for myslef,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1615,I cannot enjoy anything.All the things I used to love now leave me indifferent at best. My craft? I am not good at it anymore no point in trying. Music? It all sounds like noise. Videogames? they are all boring and samey. Friendships? I do not have those anymore. I do not have anything going on in my life no career no education no money no skills nothing I can be proud of. I am well aware my problem has a solution working hard earning what I want but none seems to understand that I do not have it in me to solve my own life.I do not want to go to college I want to sleep all day long scream until my throat hurts and cry my eyes out.Life is pointless to me and the only reason why I am not ending it all is because of my boyfriend.

1625,Been a year and a day since my cat died. No one to talk through the pain with no one to distract me from the pain no one because every human I care about has been dead longer than that. And making new connections? Well I do not like most of you. I bring myself to tolerate one of you people once in a blue moon and quickly you infuriate me and make me regret it.I have long struggled to get along with people but more and more I am finding myself disgusted and annoyed by humanity. This emptiness in my heart where love used to be I have this desire to fill it with new love but I cannot even meet humans I like. Really this rant did not need to be posted but this is meant to be a blanket message for the people in my inbox asking me are you doing any better? NO I am NOT DOING ANY FUCKING BETTER. EVERYONE IS STILL DEAD I am STILL ALONE MAGIC did not FIX MY LIFE SOMEHOW YOU CAN STOP ASKING BECAUSE IT IS NEVER GETTING BETTER! I have not even been posting on reddit and you fucking dogooders are still in my inbox offering clichd advice that has nothing to do with my fucking life or situation. Maybe it worked for you and your broken marriage or for your neglectful spouse or whatever the fuck your issue is but it has nothing to do with a misanthropic hermit who is disgusted by humanity. Everyone you care about every last being on this planet you care about has to die before you can walk a mile in my shoes. So stop thinking you can give me any fucking advice when you still have happiness and love in your life you do not know how it is to be devoid of it. ampx200BThis means all of you sending me checkup messages I did not ask for. I do not want your attention I do not want your kind words. You are trying to be nice to a disturbed person to feel better about yourself it is mental masturbation it does nothing for me.

Some of us here know we will eventually take ourselves out its just a matter of time but the wars over and we are fighting a lost battle When your permanent state is depression,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1642,Seriously when I look back at all my attempts all I am filled with is deep regret I did not go through with it. Not one single moment even the best of them has been worth the following pain and discomfort that I live with on a daily basis. I hardly feel anything for anyone anymore as well and it is just miserable watching all my current relationships slowly dry up into nothingness. I truly despise being brought into this god forsaken world Each day I do not off myself is another day I will regret later,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1647,Literally only downloaded Reddit so I could get this of my chest. there is nothing specifically wrong with me I have a supportive family amazing SO a job and almost two degrees. Yet every day all I can think about is ending it all. I feel like I am drowning and no one can hear me. I cannot talk to my gf about it because I do not want to worry her or put a burden on her and I will not tell my parents for the same reason. I try to talk to my best friend about it and he turns the shit around on me like its my fucking fault I have depression. I cannot help it. I try to talk to my big brother about it and he just finds a way to make the situation about himself. Idk. I am just confused and going through the motions rn. Fake it till you make it right? I am not going to do it but I want to.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1648,My doc prescribed a med to supplement the snri that I am on. The first prescription was free....how nice of them... When I picked it up I see that the pill is 0.25mg and a 30 day supply has a list price of almost 1500.00. that is 200000 per gram. I know that is not what I will ever pay but I am just not going to be part of this insanity. I will find another way. I am finally pushing back on my prescription...,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1649,Everything feels like a blur. it is all meaningless life just flies by day after day and I just forget what happened in the past week. I do not even know what the emotions I feel are anymore. I have not gone outside in over 2 weeks and I cannot exactly do that because I am a minor. I do not want to keep living like this. Blurry,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1651,Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I am leaving. I have no closure and still do not even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I am a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just do not have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out but was quickly reminded why I do not spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I have stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily which I had not done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cannot even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just do not understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me its time to die. I do not expect any one to respond or even read this.

1656,As I write in rdepression. I state my life is fine. I know decent people and I have survived the indecent. I have learned a lot and my life is very decent for a 26 year old black man born in low class society. The worst thing in my life is probably masturbation and with that I am down to like 1 a days. I have goals and dreams. My family is decent enough. I have ladies in my life. I am actually Elevating I can feel it. I have never gotten the girl I was after everyone I have wanted I have failed at so all my loves are circumstantial. I achieve in all but the loves I choose. In that I have still had women I still achieve the casual sex and I am about to be a millionaire and I doubt that will hurt my chances and I have even analyzed all my failure and it is made me better in my approach... so yea nothings wrong with me. Failure was never an option because I did not quit. I believe in God and I have beat the suicidal tendencies. there is nothing I dislike more in a game than a quitter. Why rdepression? I feel like life's been an interesting ordeal to say the least but fuck I feel like being a black man on this planet blows. If I had not joined the military in the past I would be fucked on a highway to nowhere right now and it is only getting worse on this planet. I was born 1995 before Gameboy got color and as we evolved through technology it feels to me that we have devolved as beings. Shit I myself am piece of work and I work hard. It took a lot to be this decent I literally dealt with years of darkness and still do but I do not want to kill anyone or destroy the world... I used to though. Honestly I think everyone is capable of anything if they put their mind to it but you must be willing to continue.Information is key you have to be willing to grow. You must apply information to effort no matter how fast or slow. The snail does not know where the fuck it is going and its not even capable of high speeds but that fuckers moving. Being poor being stagnant these are mindsets. Set your mind to something else. Knowing your situation is half the battle the rest is faith baby. The odds of any of this existence bullshit do not exist infinitesimal. Which means you are already beating the odds. Keep fucking fighting do not quit. This is for me as much as it is for whoever reads.I hope you equalstand... the better you are the better I am the better we can be to eachother that is better people on the planet making things a slightly better place. it is those who know the darkness that shine the brightest. Be brave. The time is always now. Do with that info what you will. I hope reddit does not remove this. I hope it touches someone. You are not alone in your suffering there are others there is hope you are a good enough reason to continue. You are a great enough reason to be better. Blessings upon you from a stranger Hyiding. There is nothing wrong with me,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1663,I just worry that even if I get a better life I still will not be happy. I will still be just as miserable as I am now. Even if I had a reason to feel joy or just be ok with what was happening I would not be and I would know that at that point it would be all over. I would be beyond repair. I already feel way older than I am and I just want to have lived a full life already. It could have been a horrible life as long as I was older and closer to the end. As long as I could be less tired or at least have a reason to be tired. I am scared things will get better.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1670,Another summer that i do not do anything another summer that i got to work in a job that i hate. For how much longer i would live like that?

Fuck i am 25 and i have not done anything in my life and at this point i know that i will not do anything. I do not have dreams anymore whenever i dreamed about anything it became nightmare instantly.this is really the last powers that i got in my mind and body. I do not have any reason to keep going i really do not. For how much longer?,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1674,My life fucking sucks to put it simply constant pain all over everyday now I have got covid and been isolating 6 days its getting to me I have started hurting myself i need to get out my room but I cannot i just do not know if i can carry on i hate myself I just want to die,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1677,Hey so I have posted a few places for support but no community has given me any so I am trying here.Backstory I have always struggles with depression and intrusive thought usually brought on by my father who is verbally abusive. He likes turning anything good to something negative. About me I am 20 this year and studying I moved out of parent's place and was doing so good until Covid decided to make us poor so I had to go back to my parents. I have been diagnosed with depression and bipolar and am pretty familiar with when to know a manic episode is coming but my depression just hits me low.All my colleagues always call me floaty because I am happy and chill by nature. I never fight and always ignore drama and conflict. Here I get to the pointMy family was recently attacked by a neighbor and my dad defended us by stabbing him so he went to jail for bail. In that time my mom and I were alone and living peacefully without problems or drama but my dad was suffering in jail and we kept on working to fairly get him out so he was the victim. I was really worried about my dad coming home because he is always been very negative and makes anything a problem. He came back a nice modest man who is grateful for everything. This however lasted only a week and once again everything in my home is cold and dark. We had a party and one of the guests accidentally packed his phone in when leaving. My dad went crazy accusing her of theft and screaming at us even though I got the phone back immediately. I had a panic attack due to all the screaming and anger.Today nobody in the house is talking everything is tense.I am just depressed and disappointed. I have been crying and nothing is happy anymore. The whole situation just completely through me of while I had been stable and happy till now.We have an apartment by the beach where I want to flee since I can still have online class from there and my workplace allows me to travel since we serve the whole country so I can go there and still work and study without any additional moving or trouble Problem is that our country has some limits on traveling between states right now however the apartment there is on my name and I could say I am going home.Should I stick it out at home or try to go? I know I cannot reject my father because his fragile yet his behavior is affecting my mental health. What would you do in this situation? External Factors harming recovery,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
1683,I do not want to live anymore. I am 16 and everything in my life sucks.My parents have been divorced for years we moved across countries my father started a new family and when he heard that I do not see his family as my family he sent me off to a therapist. I have got absolutely no support in anything from anyone. When I grow up I want to be a musician but my parents do not like that Idea at all. They also play the victim card on me all the time and when I confront them about their parenting they turn it around on me. sorry this is so messy I could get into much of this stuff I just know no one cares and has the time to read so much. I just do not want to continue living. I am so tired of trying. there is no point in anything. I have never felt this way in my life but there is just no getting around it.1 day ago I was about to kill myself when I realised I do not want to. And truth is I do not want to die i just do not want to live anymore I do not know if anyone understands what I am saying. I just want time to freeze forever. I am out of options I do not know what to do. I am posting this here because why the f not and I have never even talked about this to anyone. I mean I talk about stuff like this with my therapist but I do not even have motivation to keep on going to him. it is probably due to my family saying that only weak people go to therapists and that I do not need him... But they are the ones who sent me to the therapist??I know this is like really bad writing but I do not know anymore. Through my life I have had so many issues and always tried to face them but without any motivation from anyone around me I just do not know what to do. I am incredibly sad. I just do not want to.,Depression,2,Suicidal,FALSE
