217,Recently my boyfriends ex threatened suicide and the wave of emotions that washed over me was almost too much. I grew up in a very abusive household where my sister and I were both physically beat and emotionally abused. I had the added bonus of being sexually abused. From a very young age we learned to fear our father and his moods. I can recall my mom attempting suicide multiple times when I was growing up. I can vividly remember seeing her in the shower with her clothes still on and my dad trying to get her to throw up.Ill never forget the nights my sister had to spend in the hospital after her attempt she came very close to succeeding. My attempt was much more low key but it was there. Thank god my best friend told a school counselor he literally saved my life. Of course therapy was never an option we had to maintain the appearance of a happy family no one could know what went on behind closed doors. I am not sure where I am going with this. All these images and memories keep popping up in my head. I thought I had dealt with the trauma that was my younger years already. I guess my therapist and I still have work to do. All the women in my family have attempted suicide,Depression,2,Recently my boyfriends ex threatened suicide and the wave of emotions that washed over me was almost too much.

218,Its strange it seems like I am always either hyper aware of my existence or I feel like I do not exist at all and I am simple observing everyone else. I have felt this way for a long time but the whole feeling like I do not exist thing is starting to impact me more and more. I cannot motivate myself to do anything when it does not even feel like I am real. The feeling is so genuine that I cannot even say that I know it sounds crazy. That being said I still cannot bring myself to tell anyone in my life that I feel this way. As much as it make sense to me no one around me will get it. It would just freak them out. Does anyone else feel this way? What would be a good way to potentially bring this up to someone? I do not have a clue how I would even start that convo.

227,I just cannot live my life anymore. Every day I struggle just trying to make it through living for another day. I will addictively lose myself in fiction so that I can forget I exist in reality. I binge watch shows and play video games for 10 hours straight get little sleep and binge eat snacks. Then when I inevitably have to take a break I feel an insurmountable wave of depression and misery hit me. I hate remembering I exist in reality. I hate becoming aware of my meaningless worthless disgusting ugly horrible self. Being reminded I am complete garbage and not deserving of anything I have or desire. Then it gets so bad that I feel like I need to finally do something to snap out of it. I have to take charge of my life again.So I try. I practically kill myself working incredibly hard to push through my anxiety and fear and panic trying to talk to people trying to become social trying to find new hobbies trying to go to school and trying to find jobs living healthy going to therapy... and all it does is make things worse. I do not feel any sense of relief I just find new things to stress about new things to make me feel unloved worthless and empty.So I retreat from all of them avoid them and shut them all away. And I go back to trying to numb my mind. Trying to forget I am even real. I sleep all day never getting out of bed refusing to exercise refusing to cook refusing to clean my house just wanting to forget I am even real. I do not know why I am even still around anymore to be honest.I do not even feel like I have the right to talk about depression compared to people who actually suffer through it. I am just a brat a spoiled pretentious entitled fucker. The only reason I am depressed is because I am almost 30 years old and have never been able to experience having a girlfriend. Ever since I hit puberty more than 15 years ago it is the only thing that is been on my mind. it is been my obsession yet no matter how hard I have tried I just fail.Everything else in life has been handed to me. I have a great family plenty of money I am skilled at almost anything I set my mind to I make friends easily when I want to but the one thing that always trips me up is my inability to relate to women in any kind of intimate romantic way. I always fail at that and my inability to experience the intimacy I long for and crave makes everything else in my life feel meaningless.Why should I care about being healthy having a job going to school having a family having skills and talents having hobbies having fun or doing anything if I cannot experience the one thing I want most having a lover? So I sacrifice and ignore everything else and lose myself in romantic fiction day in day out. Reading and watching it obsessively wanting to pretend the real me does not exist. I hate myself. I do not deserve to exist. I am literally the worst. I hate waking up in the morning and being alive. I cannot take this anymore,Depression,2,I just cannot live my life anymore.

255,Summary I felt great but then I called the cops on my friend for sexual assault some nsfw which they took extremely seriously and I do not want to go to court. Then my cat died and I am in pain. I think my friend filmed my family in the toilet there is lots of evidence to suggest he did. My mum told me not to call the police but I am stubborn and ignored her I thought I was doing the right thing that maybe him being on record would help future victims and that if he has any content uploaded they could find it. The police interviewed me and I told them how he used to send me porn and how I think it might be connected due to the genre. At that the police seemed concerned and went outside to contact the sergeant. They said him sending me porn was another offence they would need to investigate. I panicked and insisted it was not a big deal that I was not bothered it was just a joke I just thought there may be some connection. They said they need to contact the CID and that this is really serious. I am so scared I cannot go to court I have serious anxiety and depressive problems. All I wanted was for them to tell him off basically and put him on record not this. This has gone way too far. Before the police left the constable told me I was doing the right thing and that I was brave. I do not think I am though my friend could go to prison because of me! I hate myself so much right now. Later on my mum was driving me home and she told me my cat died. She was hit by a car which killed her instantly. I sobbed the whole way home. My mum kept her in the freezer and I needed to see because I was having a hard time believing it. She was cold and curled up like she was asleep. I sat there stroking her fur and crying. I feel like its my fault. We moved to the city near a busy road and since she kept escaping we decided to let her go outside. I was told I could send her to live with my father but I said no because he was abusive and mistreated her so I thought she would be safer with my mum. I moved away recently and could have brought her over but did not. I said the roads might be busy but I was far away from the road. And now she is dead. Its all my fault. I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago like really happy and confident I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court.

I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago like really happy and confident I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court. I want to live and I want to be happy but I am so scared and do not think I can do it I really need help right now because everything is going wrong,Suicidal,FALSE

But it really sucks because even when I am doing this I easily lose interest and end up having to start something new way before I even come close to finishing what I just started. Yet despite this I cannot stop because if I do not do this I feel like I am simply just breathing and not actually living. I am always overwhelmed by boredom and fatigue but even more than that I just feel so very empty all the time. Its as if there is a large gaping hole at the bottom of my heart no matter how much I fill it up everything just falls right out and once again it is empty again. The excitement fades too quickly,Suicidal,FALSE

310,About a week and a half ago I was in the middle of a road trip and the main plan was to go skydiving for our first time. I went with my roommates a couple and we did.Well sort of. My roommate did not jump. it is whatever but maybe not totally. Anyways his girlfriend and I did jump.During the wait and the climb and when we were about to drop I was nervous. But I was determined to do this for myself so that is what I did. As we plunged out of the plane my instructor tandem we dropped for maybe 30 seconds free fall pulled the chute and floated to the ground. I initially thought it was crazy. Insane. Thought there is a chance I might die if the chute failed. But it did not. And while we dropped I was a little scared but as I landed on the ground I found myself disappointed. While I was hoping to feel something really genuine I really did not. What I felt was fear sure but not actually life threatening fear and had no adrenaline for doing it. I now a week and a half later feel as if I have done nothing in the past two weeks.Can I not feel something real? Is this all just an idea I foster for myself that I can feel true excitement again? Or is it a lie? Can I really not feel things for what they are now? I have so many questions that I cannot answer yet I cannot even bring myself to a counselor to figure this out.I do not know anymore. I expect nothing good from this to be honest.

319,I recently moved for college. I definitely had moments where I felt sad in high school and at home but its never been that bad. I feel really crushes by my expectations. There was this guy I talked to and I thought that we could really like each other. But I feel like I just liked the idea of him and I really do not know anything about him. I do not know why I cannot stop liking people. I want a relationship to feel good about myself and to not feel lonely and I know this could never lead to happiness. The only sense of excitement I feel is when someone likes me back or when I get compliments. I always posts pictures of myself on social media to feel good and so that other can think I am good looking. I do not like who I am now. I feel like I constantly rely on others people validation. I have talents and achievements but I feel like I do them all to have the ability to say I did them. Or I do things so that I can tell others about them and they can think that I am talented and good at things. I cannot even enjoy shows books or games without feeling like they are all pointless eventually. I do not really know what I like or what I am good at. I do not really know what it means to be happy and I have always felt this emptiness inside for a really long time. I think too much about school and I am obsessive about grades. Even when I score badly on a meaningless assignment I feel awful about myself and I believe that if I do not do well that means that others are better than me. I constantly compare myself to others too. I do not know how to have fun because all I do is worry. I am shy and introverted around people because I worry that they will judge me for what I say and I always pick my words so that they put me in the best light and so that they will like me. It makes it difficult for me to make friends and go out because I am terrified of what they will think of me. I do not know if I really enjoy anything. Everything in my life feels like a checklist. I do not think about dying a lot but I do imagine what its like to just be gone. I do not really think ill miss out on anything.
