231,Lost all Will to continue but desperately trying to hold on. My girlfriend of 7 years since highschool broke up with me. We both had a lot of hardships and tried so desperately to keep positive. She was stuck home isolated due to unfortunate circumstances and for over a year we haven't really been able to see one another in person. I've been working hard to get a car and enough money just for a chance to see her. Even for a second. When things finally started to go into my favor...well she broke up with me. It was a mutual break up as she wanted to focus on herself and didn't wanna hurt me in anyway.But yet I feel like I've lost my only purpose of getting up in the morning. I respect her decision and her as a person. But it just hurts to badly.,Depression,2,Lost all Will to continue but desperately trying to hold on.

She has trust issues after suffering abuse from her birth parents at a young age and her situation is only complicated further with bipolar depression and fetalalcohol syndrome. She's in good hands now living with her aunt and is becoming independent with a job. Though I've noticed throughout our relationship that she has a tendency to push me away l whereas I am the exact opposite though I understand her situation it's not her fault. She says she loves me and I love her but she doesn't seem comfortable showing any affection holding hands hugging and kisses on the cheek are extremely rare from her.,Normal,3,So for a few years now I've been in a relationship with this girl who very likely has PTSD given her upbringing.

446,hi HiI'll start by saying I've been diagnosed with AvPD about 2 years ago around the end of my military service but it's something I've dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a 22 years old still. I'm seeing a therapist for the better part of 2 years now and it helps mainly mentally not physically yet as I'm not doing much spending all my days at home no friends no social life no nothing. I did get a job last week which I'm starting next week 4 hours a day cleaning some school buildings 5 minutes from my house.But as the time goes I find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff I'd like to do like traveling the world and studying I even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like 3 days before the semester started. Since then I'm daydreaming about traveling going to south america or something..Last week I said screw it and booked a ticket to Barcelona for a trip with my mom and sister. I was very excited as I'm a big FC Barcelona fan for years but as we all know something has to go wrong. We're supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days I had in the last couple of years. I feel like I just wanna disappear until Friday arrives when the trip is over. I feel like it's a task someone is commanding me to finish and not something I ever wanted to do. It took me some time cause I usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister and now they're thinking whether they should cancel or go and they're waiting for my desicion. I also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didn't know like how I don't talk to my 2 friends anymore or how before I got this poor job I was sending CV's and when people would call me I couldn't pick up the phone. I told her that I feel lonely even when I'm with them my family cause while they do make me feel good they can't cover up for my nonexistent social life.Seriously I feel like a mess I roam around feeling down like I've never felt before I think.
