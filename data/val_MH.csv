35738,35733,Kidney infection? Im a 36yo female.A few weeks ago I recognized a UTI coming on. I did what we all do and started drinking a ton of water and taking my cranberryprobiotic capsules. By chance my annual gyno exam was like two days after it started. Even though my symptoms had started to get better with still occasional pain with urination I asked them about it. They said they didnt see anything but I begged and she begrudgingly gave me 3 days worth of antibiotics. Then I started getting back pain.. but this is normal for me I have back problems. It was across my lower back so didnt seem to be specifically over my kidneys. It got pretty bad and I went to urgent care where they did another urine which was clear again possibly because of the super short dose of antibiotics the week prior they gave me muscle relaxants and sent me on my way. The NEXT week this week the pain started to intensify. It started keeping me up at night and was definitely over where my right kidney should be. Back to urgent care. They said I had blood etc in my itinerary this time. Did a CT scan but didnt see stones. Gave me fluids and pain meds and a script for keflex and sent me on my way. I got about two doses under my belt and woke up yesterday morning with excruciating pain that now radiated to my abdomen as well. I was getting cold chills and nausea. I headed for the ER. They ran a gamut of tests on me and concluded that its a raging kidney infection. They admitted me and Ive been on IV pain meds and antibiotics. My white cell count which was pretty high is normalizing. No more chills or nausea. My question is why isnt my pain going away? When the meds wear off its still excruciating! Im a realist.. I know theres still going to be SOME pain.. Ive been in the hospital for two days though and it ruts almost exclusively in my abdomen now. The nurse cant seem to explain it to me and I wont see the doctor until the morning. Im concerned that this is something more nefarious than a kidney infection but Im wondering if anyone has had an experience like this or has any input at all really that might help. Thank you so much in advance! ,Anxiety
52404,52705,Im going on anxiety detox I want to cut caffeine and sugar intake and start meditating everyday 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at nightafter 10 days Ill start meditating 40 minutes a day Ill also add running 5 kmsI want to report how I feel during this project and Ill try to understand if my anxiety really goes away.thankuu for all the support its really cuteDay 130 20.03 Overall this day was easy for me I didnt experience any headaches from my new nosugarnocaffeine diet my mind felt more a bit less stressed than yesterday though I slept 6 hours at nightI accidentally ate one sweet oopsiesBut I had a public speech and my body responded with a fight or flight response Public speaking is one of those things that I want to master by dealing with my anxiety issuesDay 230 21.03 Lmaoo today I did feel those headaches after cutting caffeine. They were not so strong though. I definitely feel less anxiety but not so much. My legs almost died when I was running and my sneakers are dirty afthe weather conditions in my city are Anyway I did well. I took a test so I can track my anxiety. I got 1138 score it was a social anxiety test because sometimes I start worrying when I talk with peopleThe test results say that my anxiety level is considered as low and thats true but I want to feel 100 confident around any person and in any situation. Public speaking still awakens in me fear of being judged so its still a big way to go.Day 330 22.03 It was really hard to get up from bed and I dont know why maybe because of cutting sugar. Meditated twice in the morning because yesterday I accidentally fell asleep while wanting to take a nap Omg my legs hurt so much when I runToday I feel more stable than before this project and even yesterday as if my inner psychological core or something has grown stronger I stopped worrying about little things that always bothered me before this challenge. For example I stopped hesitating to talk to handsome guysDay 430 23.03 I probably wont run today my legs are sore. I stopped having mood swingsFeel much more relaxed than ever before. Things really bother me much less. I just stopped thinking random negative thoughts. My hands used to shake from stress sometimes now it doesnt happen.upd no it still doesI had little eczema caused by my nervousness on the back of my hand now its completely gone. Headaches dont bother me I dont crave sweets but I started to eat much more.Day 530 24.03 I feel really goodI started to understand my anxious thoughts and emotions and realised how I used to repress them their symptoms rapid heartbeat trembling hands. Its funny how theyre going away now when I noticed my resistance towards them. Like I used to get annoyed and try to control my body when my hands started shaking or tried to calm down my heart when I get worried now I just let go of control. Today I also didnt run instead I walked 6kms on a high speed. I dont mean to ruin the challenge it just seems like I injured my legs.Day 630 25.03,Anxiety

I have an eye appointment next week and my mom is letting me use her disposable ones for practice. Im terrified of what it could do to my eye though.

35078,35081,I'm genuinely unhinged I currently and have done for the past week have pinching cold tingling sensations all over my body. It starts off as a tingle and distils into a pinchy itchy feeling. I have no rash it's all over my body fingertips neck hairline ankles elbows. I'm going mad. I want out of my skin and mainly out of my head. I cannot believe that my mind would cause such symptoms if it is that and not something massively creepy and neurological. I'm obsessed with my health keep imagining a great big tumour pulsating away in my head. The symptoms become worse the more I concentrate on them and I can create pretty much any feeling depending on what I decide to latch on to and worry about. The last fear was unequal pupils and that's triggered a worry something neurologically wrong. I went to the eye hospital and they scanned my eyes looking for abnormal discs pressure etc nothing was wrong. I also had another perfect blood test. I cancelled a CT scan of my head because I panicked about the radiation. I feel mad,Anxiety

If my symptoms is very specific why wouldn't Google be correct? I mean to say that I realize there can be many causes but if I'm experiencing something very specific and the most likely cause is on Google wouldn't it be fairly accurate? I'm having a tough time convincing myself not to Google but not because I think it's incorrect but because I'm scared I'll find the truth on there. I hope in making sense in explaining my meaning.

34500,34514,fear of rabies hi i'm new to this subreddit but i've been lurking it for a while so i figured i'd give this a shot instead of other forums. i've been a hypochondriac since i was little but it's been kind of getting worse with age. now something new and exciting has hit me super hard and super fast rabies!it comes and goes and my ocd a whole other animal makes it worse but right now it's at one of its peaks. long story short my HEALTHY VACCINATED dog scratched me and since then the spot on my wrist where it's at has had an internal tickling sensation and to make matters worse when i get nervous my throat gets tight and i feel like i can't swallow. i feel like i'm fully going crazy.i love all my dogs but due to all of this i can't even bear to be around them anymore. i just sit around and cry all day on the lookout for symptoms and trying to come down from all this anxiety and it's almost like i can't trust myself to know that i didn't contract anything. like 'i KNOW it's all in my head but HOW DO I REALLY KNOW?' or 'WHAT IF ITS REAL THIS TIME' or something.i'm starting to feel hopeless and like i'll never calm down again. i feel really dumb and embarrassed because i definitely know better but i just... like won't listen to my better judgement. my family and friends are sick of me being such a mess and that makes me feel bad too.sorry if this is long or ranty or hard to follow this has really gotten under my skin pun kind of intended. can anyone relate or offer some advice? if you've had the same problem what did you do? i'm kind of super at the end of the rope with this lmao,Anxiety
34699,34707,Im so tired of it all but I cant stop thinking something is wrong with me. Ive never had health anxiety but Ive been blessed with plenty of other types. Lately HA seems to be my primary form.Back in August I visited the ER for 104 degree fever that affected my vision in October urgent care sent me to the ER for an uncharacteristic migraine. In November I started getting chest pain which sent me to the ER several times out of fear. After numerous EKGs blood tests a stress test and event monitor setup Im told Im fine but have some PVCs. Im still getting the chest pains palpitations and headaches and multiple doctors ranging from primary care to ER to neurologists to cardiologists all attribute it to stress. Last year my blood pressure used to be 12173 when visiting the doctor but lately its skyrocketed to 15088 in the office. Taking it at home I average about 12876 but I can see my pulse go up when I take it.Im so scared about a multitude of things happening to me and I cant stop thinking about the unknown. I dont know if Im really okay or if theres something wrong with me with the constant headaches and other symptoms.How do people deal with this?,Anxiety

34337,34354,The fear just keeps getting worse and I need some advice Hi allI've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kidbut this past month I have been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.Instead I just keep googling and freak myself out constantly.The past month I've been very paranoid about pregnancywhich is irrational in itself my last sexual contact was in october and the circumstances made pregnancy very unlikelyafter PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovariesand because of this I worry that she could have missed it if it was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.I know this probably sounds crazy but I can't shake the thought that there's a ticking time bomb inside of me.I'm really panicked and I just want to move on.How do I deal with this?,Anxiety
52222,52517,Do you ever get intense chills with your anxiety? From time to time when my anxiety is acting up I start shivering almost violently. All of my muscles clench so hard that sometimes my abdomen begins to hurt. It usually appears to be related to feeling cold but not always. For example I had a cat attacked by a stray dog a little while back and before I could do anything to help her I nearly fell to the ground I got these chills so bad. I had to sit down and take a bunch of deep breaths before I could function.I couldnt even look at her or Id just start shaking worse. I think the correlation to the cold is psychological. I walk into a cold room or get out of my warm bed and it starts but usually only when Im worried that it might happen to begin with. Does this sound like a standard anxiety response to you all?,Anxiety

34949,34954,Healthy anxiety is literally going to kill me Sorry for the essay Okay so you're all going to probably think I'm a nut job and you're probably right.. I've been a bit of a hypochondriac since a child but it's gotten way worse in recent years I'm now 27. I actually don't even know what to do anymore? I went to counselling about this last year and it did zilch! The past year has been my absolute worst!!!I'm a Googler and it's really starting to piss me off! Every single pain I get I end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. Heck sometimes I don't even Google it and I just assume it's something bad! The anxiety got that bad in the summer time that I was crying every night and having no sleep thinking I was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. I'd literally made my self depressed. I then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. I just don't want to have death thoughts everytime I feel a pain or a niggle! I'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase I feel a lump!!! I also hate it when I see articles on Facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and I end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! I'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now it's exhausting!So my question is is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? And how are you coping with it? I literally can't go on like this feeling like i'm going to die all the time. It's an absolute waste of life.,Anxiety
35697,35692,Hello I could use advice...I am suffering from rather severe health anxiety. At least I think I am? Hello I just want to say I'm really sorry if I break any of the rules! I am a bit confused as to what is allowed I don't know if there is a point to this I am just...confused and scared.I am 15 and for the past years I have experienced extreme fatigue to the point where I sleep 15 hours a day when I can. But how do I know if this is real? I could just have a bad lifestyle. I try my best to stay healthy and do everything the doctor says but it doesn't go away. I also believe I could be faking it? I experience a lot of weakness and like...memory problems. I also get chronic pain in my thigh which is really painful. But the thing is...there is nothing that could cause this? I don't think there is. It is incredibly random am I making this up to seem like something is wrong? I have previously been diagnosed with depression and GAD but I got those treated. But I am still worrying about this? I am on medications that have helped so why am I still anxious over my health? They worked for everything else I think it is something in my mind because I keep getting Dreams that make me feel no one can be trusted or that I will be yelled at or do something wrong. How do I even know if I'm suffering from health anxiety? What if I am just exaggerating everything? Maybe I am just a person who is afraid to grow up or that I am immature...I am really sorry if this broke any rules or didn't make sense. I guess it was just an outlet! I have been scared for a while now. Thank you for reading if you have any advice on something I could maybe do to help calm my nerves I would appreciate it very much ,Anxiety

I suddenly moved so I wouldn't be touched or run over by this guy w the cart. No 'pardon me' 'excuse me' nothing.This morning I come to do my laundry at my local laundromat. I usually chat w a little old lady here but she usually gets in my personal space to clean literally crumbs from the floor.I am putting laundry in and I'm suddenly butttobutt with the laundry attendant a woman comes in w a body bag sized laundry bag and almost hits me w it and I try to back up and the laundry woman is directly behind me inches behind meI finished loading the laundry and went to my car for a deep breath.

I passed it off as my asthma but the coughing since then has gotten worse and today I am running a lowgrade fever.

I have to attend a funeral out of state this weekend and the thought of being sick and having to stay in a hotel room is just dreadful.

35176,35177,Throat ear stuff going on Im having the worst day.. Ive been having random symptoms that have triggered me in a huge way.I had a bad bout of colds for almost two months and when I finally recovered I felt like I had a grain of rice in the back of my throat. Now Im prone to tonsil stones and noticed a bit come out but the feeling was still there. It almost feels as though one is lodged deep and I cant get to it or see it. Additionally Ive had some dull ear pain off and on. I went to urgent care and the doctor got out a tiny bit of something in the back of my throat but it didnt resolve it completely. She said my throat looked healthy but I still worry she missed something. Today I made the stupid mistake of checking my throat for the billionth time and noticed a white patch In the back of my throat and went down a google spiral. I feel so anxious its hard to function. I have a little baby and he deserves better than what Im giving him right now. I feel like a failure and yet I cant break out of this vicious cycle. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms?

35575,35570,Antibiotic cocktail and side effects Disgusting me has a bacterial infection in the stomach and I'll have to take 15 pills every day of antibiotics to get rid of it. Normally I won't take a look at the side effects because I know I will go insane about them but after my mother saw the prescription she said I should consider another form of antibiotic treatment that only has 70 success rate compared to 95 but less side effects. SO I looked up the side effects and its worse than anything I've ever taken. It's nausea and diarrhea and vomiting in over 10 of cases and a condition with black burnt skin and multiple organ failure with unknown probability. As I'm already vegetarian and you're not allowed to eat dairy products I have to go vegan for a week and I'm not allowed to go outside in the sun cause the medication will cause my skin to burn in the sun.I can't find the side effects for the other therapy but I also I want to be done with the whole thing if I survive the ten days.

34944,34950,Eyelids twitching for many months? Just wondering how many people here have had their eyelids twitching for many months or longer? If you finally got it to go away what did you do?I see a lot of posts where people are stressing about eyelids twitches theyve had for days or weeks or sometimes hours. But mine have twitched to varying degrees since last May or so. I have tried several bouts of destressing improving my sleep meditating exercising eating bananas drinking tonic water taking multivitamins ... but cant seem to get them to stop twitching.I also notice if I blink hard sneeze look certain directions etc that theyll start twitching. If I partially close my eyes then the muscles around my eyes quiver like theyre straining to hold the position. Which leads me down the path of thinking its more than stress anxiety and something more in my muscles or nervous system. Especially since it has lasted this long through many periods of low stress.Any advice from people who have beaten this? I cant even remember what it was like to go a whole day without twitching! ,Anxiety

Felt ok the first couple doses but I noticed on the 3rd dose I felt kind of light headed and fuzzy. Took my 4th dose around 10 and about an hour ago got up from the couch and was really dizzy. It seems like its a bit better now Im not dizzy while sitting anymore. But I googled and started freaking out some sites say dizziness is a common side effect and some say severe dizziness can be a sign of an allergic reaction. So I started freaking out even more and now I feel like my throat is closing up. I can drink water though and breathe so Im hoping that part is just my anxiety making everything worse.

35153,35154,anxiety over leg numbness so i've had crippling anxietyhealth anxiety for 2 years now. it's been such a torture in my life and i still havent gone to see a therapist mostly financial reasons. but anyway two nights ago my left leg started feeling restless while i was lying in bed and i didn't think much of it and went to bed with no problem. i woke up forgetting about it until i remembered and the feeling came back even worse. it feels like how your limbs feel after they fall asleep and you wake them up slightly numb and tingly and sometimes it feels kinda like how your legs burn after you exercise. this has been going on for two days and it's caused me so much panic because i automatically think its DVT. it was so bad that last night i had the worst panic attack i've ever had and i legitimately could not breathe. i took a xanax and i could breathe again and went to sleep but i've been dealing with it all day and my breathing has been hay wire today which is especially great since DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism which is shortness of breath so lol.... i'm going to the doctor tomorrow but i'm scared as hell. i'm trying to convince myself it's just a pinched nerve but it's so hard. i really hate living like this because i'm not even living at all.,Anxiety

35437,35433,I hate this stupid disease. My HA first manifested itself when I was a freshman in college. I felt a coldness in my chest on the way home for a weekend probably a flare up of the anxiety I didnt know I had triggered after moving away from home for the first time dealing with college life and new workload homesickness my parents moved from my respective childhood homes first childhood pet died etc. I googled my symptoms and thats where it all went downhill. Heart attack. All of the sudden I was sweating shaking chills feeling of doom lightheaded I truly felt I was going to die. To the point I told my mom not to be sad when I inevitably died.Later that night I had a two hour long panic attack. I begged my boyfriend to drive an hour to where I was to take me to the hospital to which he obliged. I missed my sisters college graduation party sitting in the hospital getting laughed at and joked on by the doctors and nursing staff. Did your boyfriend break up with you recently? Are you on your period honey?.Subsequently that semester I went to the emergency room two other times. One doctor gave me an emergency script for Paxil. Never filled it. Never wanted to. Went to a cardiologist my pediatrician gastroenterologist got an endoscopy etc. I even slept at the foot of my dads bed for a week because I thought He could save me if I died. turns out Im a perfectly healthy 21 year old which is great until I started searching healthy 21 year old surprise heart attack and other similar things. The anxiety subsided after about 8 months. A few months later it resurfaced when I convinced myself I had bed bugs in my apartment. Called the bug people 5 times hired private bug people instead of my apartment ones stayed with my mom for a few weeks begged my best friend to move. No bed bugs. Eventually I healed from that two and recently random itching and a few colds has convinced me I had lymphoma. A headache recently convinced me I had brain cancer or MS. A bruise on the back of my leg has convinced me I have a deep vein thrombosis for the last three weeks. My anxiety has caused me to have a slew of unimaginable PHYSICAL symptomsArm and leg painItchy skinChest painTingling Numbness PanicSweatingShiveringRashesStomach pain Twitching musclesHeadachesHeavy headPins and needlesBack painJoint painSusceptibility to more colds and flusMood swingsfatigue Lack of appetiteIncreased appetiteMissed periodsI hate this terribly debilitating disease. A disease most people will never understand. Convinced my family and friends dont believe me and dont trust me and dont take me seriously convinced the doctors must be missing something convinced Ill be that rare case that dies at 21 from a heart attack.

34626,34635,I think I'm losing my mind Hello guys long time lurker here. I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.It all started last summer when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test I was 20 at the time. I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. Fast forward to last week that pain came back exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days but today I saw in a stool some darkbrownish spots which I believed to be blood.This has gone too far. I have no idea what I should do but I want to get out from this dumb situation. I don't enjoy life the way I used to because of some stupid thoughts.,Anxiety

52164,52458,How to get over embarrassment over having an anxiety attack at work? So the other day I had a full blown anxiety attack at work. All of the sudden my heart started racing my whole body was shaking so bad I felt like I couldn't breathe and I was terrified. The fact that this was happening at work made it 1000 worse. I was with a coworker and had to run to the bathroom for like 10 minutes to try to calm down. I barely calmed down but went back out to help customers. I was probably obviously shaking like a lunatic but I did my best to work through it. I was honest with my coworker and told them what was going on.This is a job that I've been doing on and off for several years. Nothing bad happened but my life has been chaotic lately and it just snowballed right then and there. How do I get over the embarrassment of this happening not only in front of my coworker but customers too? I still don't know if my coworker told my boss but if they had I'm sure my boss would have reached out by now. The last time I had an anxiety attack this bad was about 2.5 years ago. So it's not a common occurrence but when I go back to work I'm afraid of it happening again or about repeat customers commenting on it. I just feel so ashamed and like a total loser. I'm in my mid twenties this shouldn't be happening. I want to hide in bed forever.,Anxiety
35292,35291,Painful hard lump behind ear.... Mastoiditis? I have this painful hard lump on my mastoid process that hard bone that's right behind the ear on only my right side. I literally just noticed it about an hour ago. It's tender to the touch and now I can feel dull pain in that spot without touching it. I have no idea if it's been there all day I didn't notice it at all.The closest thing I can find that it could be is mastoiditis. I have no other symptoms other than the fact that I noticed my hearing was slightly worse than my right ear a couple of times in today before I noticed the bump.I'm extremely scared and I don't have any support everyone around me writes things off as nothing. I keep reading things about needing antibiotics through an IV but I can't find very many people talking about mastoiditis... and obviously I don't even know if that's what it is exactly.has anyone heard of this or dealt with it??,Anxiety
35602,35597,Pro tip don't Google symptoms if you're logged into Facebook. They will use the data from your searches to give you relevant ads and articles and it will exacerbate your HA. There have been times where I've frantically googled the symptoms for everything from MS to brain tumors to ruptured ovarian cysts and shortly afterwards I would see an ad or an article about something related to it nearby gynecologists cancer centers etc. But since I've stopped doing that I don't see them as much anymore. It's been really helpful in taming my anxieties. Googling something once every so often doesn't affect the algorithm too much I don't think but when you're a chronic symptomchecker like I used to be triggering ads definitely start becoming more prevalent. So resist the keyboard and just breathe. ,Anxiety
52449,52750,Tingling in sideback of head Has anyone had head tinglingnumbness with anxiety? I spent the last 15 minutes freaking out because I woke up today feeling somewhat very anxious. A few minutes later I felt this crawlingtingling feeling that started from my left temple to the back of head. It comes and goes and boy.....the panic I felt with it was the icing on top of the cake. There's no pain whatsoever but just a weird sensation that makes me feel like the left side of my head is going numb.This is the first time it's happened to me. I have been somewhat anxious these past few days about my health so I'm not sure if that is the trigger? I don't have any headaches whatsoever. And I'm refraining from googling because I know whatever I'm reading is gonna aggravate my anxiety. But my brain has decided that it's best to jump to the worst case scenario I'm trying to keep calm because I know if I let my thoughts run loose it's going to make me feel worse.But I'm really wondering if it's the stressanxiety causing it. My neckshoulders feel relatively fine so I don't think it's a pulled muscle or tension.,Anxiety

I dont believe the things she says when I ask her if anything is wrong I dread hearing no. Nothing is going on between us yet for a while now I have the uneasy sense that shes lying to me.

34313,34330,Premature Heart Beats This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with. I have had premature atrial contractions premature junctional contraction and premature ventricular contractions for like 4 years now. At one point I was in bigeminy for 1.5 months. Scariest and most depressing time of my life. I could not leave the house and was in constant discomfort. I went to every doctor and they all claimed they were benign. Cut out this add this don't exercise too much exercise more.This is what gives me Health anxiety. There's nothing I can do about it. All my doctors including my Mayo cardiologist and electrophysiologist says an ablation would more than likely make things worse. So I live with these day in and day out. I've tried everything. The best thing I have is magnesium glycinateWhat do you do when the something you can't fix.? But you still have to go on. I'm not even worried about them killing me but they caused me so much discomfort that it affects my quality of life. I don't see an answer to this.Health anxiety to something that is actually physically happening to you but is considered benign truly sucks. Sorry for the rant,Anxiety
35632,35627,Chiropractic adjustment on neck now scared of cervical artery dissection This will sound ridiculous and it is embarassing to even type but that is what we are all here for to get these issues out in the open and find people who can support us right so here it goes. I am a 27 y.o male and have been seeing my chiro for years because I would get headaches. He uses the drop table method and I have had my neck adjusted 100s of times before. Last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated visit and mentioned I was seeing a chiropractor. He responded right away dont let him touch your neck he told me that an older patient of his had had a stroke days after a neck adjustment because of a torn artery. Now I will mention that the chiropractor this patient had seen was using a different type of manipulation on the neck as opposed to the thompson drop table method. At my chiropractic appointment yesterday he did what he normally does and worked kn my back and neck. this time my neck was sore all night and I have not been able to sleep or focus on work or my kids because all I can think about is what if he tore something what if I am going to have a stroke???? seems silly right? Anyone who has health anxiety knows that these ludicrous thoughts seep into our mind and pollute our rationality and thinking. I have all but convinced myself I am going to have a stroke and die and leave my kids behind fatherless no matter how crazy I know it sounds. My neck hurts as of writing this but very mild discomfort perhaps a 2 out of 10. I would assume if you tore an artery you would feel it? Anyways I would love some responses maybe just to reassure me or if anybody has some insight on an issue like this they could share.cheers,Anxiety

35318,35317,Can health anxiety cause real symptoms? Hi firstly I wanna say that I am a 20 year old male and I think I have developed severe health anxiety in the last 4 months I woke up one morning with an awful left back ache spreading to my chest left shoulder and arm. Went to hospital they told me its a muscle cramp gave me naproxen and told me to go see a physio if it doesnt get any better.I wasnt getting any better after few weeks I started feeling really shit had fever dizziness blurry vision body aches awful stomach cramps bloating chills sweats and back ache. Went to the doctors got an ultrasound done and was diagnosed with a kidney infection had antibiotics for a week and they told me its clear after a check up. At this stage I was still getting daily stomach cramps and tightness especially in the left side of stomach hip and shoulder dizzy spells and blurry vision. After weeks of not caring the symptoms have improved now I only get tightness in left side of stomachback and light bloating sometimes it spreads to the hip or to the shoulder and I sometimes get dizzy spells but all the other symptoms are going. I wanna say that I constantly worry about the symptoms as it is there everyday and I havent been eating enough because of it all. Ive done so many tests at my doctors as well as few scans and everything comes up clear and they say Im healthy although I feel shit.Do you think I have developed health anxiety over this due to constant stress and worry and this is what causes the feeling of tightness and bloating that I get everyday? Has anyone experienced any physical symptoms similar to this due to health anxiety and constant worry or stress? ,Anxiety

34429,34445,Recurring chest pain for around a month So I started having pain on the left side of my chest on the inner part of my pec towards the top. It happens mainly when I exhale. Kind of a sharp pain. It sometimes happens on the tail end of taking a deep breath. Movement doesn't increase it. The pain hasn't increased. It's possible that the frequency at which it happens has. I had an appoint two weeks ago and had an ekg and blood tests which neither of which showed abnormalities. Im a 29 yo male who has exercised on and off for most of my life. Only problem I have is decently high cholesterol. I called the doctor today and they made a referral to a cardiologist on Apr 21. I want to think that's to much I hope. My first worry goes to endocarditis.. Other than that I don't know what to think of it. It's hard not to worry about it. I want to assume its inflammation but I've never experienced something this consistent for so long.,Anxiety
35313,35312,Health anxiety that has lead to panic disorder My health anxiety has led to panic disorder my panic attacks are almost daily now honestly. Me health anxiety has gotten worse over the course of college I used to get sick or feel something and go on about my day and not care too much. But now if I even get a cough or cold I think I have lung cancer or something lately Ive been short of breath anytime I try and do anything night just all be in my head but it makes me wanna just lay in bed. Im an active person I lift 56x a week been taking some time off here and there because of the anxiety and panic attacks. I noticed whenever I see something like a friend being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism that Ill look it up and then think I have it or feel a normal bodily sensation and get fixated on it and make everything worse until Im in panic mode. I would have to say the worst thing is being dizzy I feel like Im constantly dizzy most places leaving my house and it makes me uncomfortable and fear Ill pass out although this wouldnt happen bc my BP is normal at those times or high if anything. Id just like to know other health anxiety worries of people fears panic attack stories what youve done to cope? Because I have a lexapro prescription but not sure about it yet. Thanks!,Anxiety

35679,35674,Afraid something is extremely wrong with my heart Hey guys. I lost my job in March due to Gastritis from unknown causes. Had an endoscopy and biopsies. It's just gastritis and they think it may be due to my gallbladder but I will be having tests for that in about a week. I have been extremely ill with that since the beginning of January. Lost almost 20 lbs. In pain all day. It's great. ANYWAY throughout this time and I think right before but only rarely I have been having having issues when I stand and start doing usual activities. My heart rate soars when I stand and when I begin doing everyday things nothing strenuous I even get sweaty sometimes and short of breath. This scares me so I have to lay back down and then it immediately goes back to normal. I have a history of PVCs the palpitation where your heart skips a beat. I saw a cardiologist and he did not see anything and said it was pretty good except he vaguely mentioned some part of the ultrasound being slower and he told me to exercise more. He didn't explain any of that. That was a year ago now. I realize I have been laying on the couch for about a month now but could that cause all this? I also often have low blood pressure but I've never had this happen everyday. Could it be any of these causes or maybe since I haven't been able to eat much anymore? My anxiety is driving me insane. Someone please help. ,Anxiety
52316,52613,Anxiety? Im trying to figure out and address an issue Ive had my entire life or at least as long as I can remember. As I try to seek out treatment and help Im not sure if anyone here can relate.I will obsess and fixate on completely mundane things. For example If I overhear someone taking about a movie but I dont know what the movie is I may fixate on Who did they say the lead was? An Australian named Ben. What was the movie? What was the movie??? and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and Ill need to get up and walk around. Another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and Ill obsess wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that Im reading. I might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is who was that guy that I helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar etc. You know how sometimes people will hear a song and not know what it is and theyll say What IS that song? Its going to drive me nuts? For me it feels like that going to drive me nuts thing is for real. These attacks might also occur in certain circumstances of guilt or selfloathing.

34067,34086,Always think I have cancer So I remember it started in high school where I started having a bump grow on a specific spot on my head and I never had any real fear before this time. I remember sitting in my class googling bump in that location and it said swollen lymph node which could be a sign of cancer. At first I was like ok no its probably just a pimple but then two weeks after that I got another one on my head where another lymph node was supposed to be located. I was terrified and I thought this was it. I went to the doctors made them send me to specialists the whole 9 yards and they kept telling me thats not a lymph node but I was convinced they had no idea what they were talking about because I read so many articles on google. Turns out they were just cysts. Since then that has sparked my fear of always thinking I had cancer. That was 3 years ago and since then I have been convinced I had bone cancer brain cancer and now stomach cancer. I have been a heavy weed smoker for a while and I started to get a tightness and cramping pains in my stomach I associated with the weed. So I quit and 2 days after quitting I got really bad runs I was nauseas and I threw up a couple times. I lost 15 pounds during this period which was a feeder into yep its cancer. The strange thing is when I stared getting better my symptoms only appeared in the morning. After this period I thought maybe it was just a sickness and not the weed so I smoked all day everyday again for another week but then started waking up nauseas so I quit again and again a couple days after quitting I got the runs. Its been brutal and I have since gotten a lot better. Although my stomach still hasnt gone back to normal Im now terrified every morning because thats usually when I go the bathroom and I freak out I have stomach cancer. I wouldnt leave my doctor alone at the time and made her run so many tests and everything always came back fine. I just want to know how some people got over this irrational fear. Im only 19 and on the cancer statistics website shows less than 1 of people who get this cancer are under 20 and most of them have a family history of it so my chances are very unlikely which I can understand but a part of me is still terrified. Thanks in advance! ,Anxiety

34750,34758,Terrified of catching the flu after ENT visit. I've been a huge germaphobe for as long as I can remember. In the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress but once cold and flu season pick up it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. Earlier today I had my biyearly appointment with my ENT to get my ears cleaned out I produce a ton of wax. I was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now and the flu is widespread. I took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. Thankfully there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. I was called back quickly the nurse took some info I sanitized my hands and then my ENT entered the room. He shook my hand and then sanitized his and got to work cleaning me out. Once he finished I asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. He demonstrated it for me and then asked me to try it. Ordinarily I dont touch my face under any circumstances but since I had just sanitized my hands and since I was just pinching the outside of my nose I was careful not to get too close to my nostrils I figured it would be okay. So I pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. On the drive home I started to think about it a bit more and realized that after I sanitized my hands I shook his hand so my hands probably were not very clean when I pinched my nose shut. And I started to get really worried that in doing so I probably exposed myself to tons of coldflu germs that will infect me in the coming days. Now I'm anxious as can be trying to find some rational reason why I shouldn't be worried here so I can calm down a bit. I havent had any luck yet. Can anybody help me out here? Also just for the record I'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. We just started back in October but unfortunately he's been out of town all of December for the holidays. I've backtracked a good bit in his absence. I'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because I have a vacation coming up next week and I really dont want to have a coldflu while traveling. ,Anxiety

34803,34810,I had no idea so many people were like me. Ever since I was 1516 I had panic attacks from thinking I was having a stroke or heart attacks or cancer etc. First was walking home from school started feeling very thirsty and hot then dizzy called 911 thinking I was dying having a heat stroke. Doc told me I had a panic attack. Now I'm 25 and been in and out of work due to my panic attacks or just the anxiety of having panic attacks. Im super depressed and have no drive to be the best me anymore. I feel stuck and like I'll never get better. Pot works wonders but unfortunately I don't live in a legal state. And since I'm looking for a job I can't use it I have to rely on my clonopin which only helps if I catch the panic attack in time. I get pains or find something wrong on my body and assume the worst instantly and go full panic mode. Fucking sucks. It's ruined my life all I do now is put in job applications and play BFV to keep my mind off my body. Last income I've had was from a guy I used to work concrete construction with who hires me as a ranch hand ever so often but only for about a week a year. My father supports me but I hate relying on him because he barely makes any money doing what he does and we are always short on food because rent and utilities come first. I hate doing this to him.

34315,34332,New to this Hey allIm new to Reddit but some recent health concerns have made me feel like I should reach out to some objective people for my situation. Im 24 years old and before a little over a week ago I thought I was in great health. A little over a week ago I started noticing heart palpitations didnt know what it was called for a while and chest pain. I thought this would just go away but it didnt after a couple of days. Then I had my first and second ever anxiety attacks. These were scary but I felt like I was anxious about my palpitations because they lasted all day and night. My pulse was constantly 20 bpm faster than it used to be and the chest ache and pain lasted almost 24 hours. Ive seen doctors and nurses and Ive had a chest Xray blood work and CT done and they didnt find anything abnormal. Ive been tracking my blood pressure as well and its constantly in the 15090 range and today during a snow day Ive been laying in bed and the pain and palpitations are feeling worse than ever and my BP was 160110 and my pulse 105. I had a Holter monitor and Im waiting to hear the results. I also started seeing a counselor. I dont consciously feel anxious and my symptoms last all day and all night. Im waiting for my next doctors appointment but Im just reaching out because I feel worse day after day and just wanted to see if anyone else has been through something similar to this.Thanks,Anxiety

I don't know if the blurred vision is permanent and i've just gotten use to it or not but ive definitely had these phases. Ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions B12 deficiencies and a whole load more. With B12 deficiency in particular its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. Other than my symptoms ive mentioned already B12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss' i feel like i have these or atleast they're more pronounced recently ive always been fairly forgetful.Im genuinely worried if i have some serious conditon. Ive booked an appointment with my doctor and hopefully i can get however many of these symptoms i actually have sorted. Sorry for this being so long winded. Stay healthy friends.,Anxiety

51846,52125,Don't know if I'm in the right place for this... Recently it was seeming like my life was finally getting on track. I had taken control of my addictions I was being more productive I was seeing myself changing into a better person. Good things were happening.Then out of nowhere everything just came crashing down like many times before.I don't know if people think like me or that far ahead for that matter but I don't think I am the only one who fears such an overwhelming anxiety about not achieving whatever it is you want in life. I have been feeling like I won't ever be able to achieve even the most basic things that all other humans are able to achieve. I can't explain the reason why I feel this way but it's basically being anxious that I'm failing at life as a whole and that I'm not taking advantage of the precious time that I have on earth.Like I'm just here and wish to stay here but when do I start living?,Anxiety
51985,52270,I feel like a car idling and the gas is in full throttle. I haven't slept in two nights and I've been drinking too I was hoping the alcohol would knock me out but it hasn't. My girlfriend is asleep beside me and I really don't wanna wake her but I'm concerned because I've been convulsing and my heart kinda of aches too. I also haven't eaten so I'm completely drained of energy but I'm trying to stay hydrated...I just don't know what to do anymore.,Anxiety
34908,34915,Feeling of trapped burpexcessive burpingNausea Hello all lately Ive been going through a scare as someone with IBS. Lately Ive been excessively burping. Even if I havent eaten anything yet and especially once I eat something. However the thing is sometimes I need to force the burp out because it feels like its trapped in my stomach or chest or throat. And when Im unable to get the burp out it makes me feel nauseous. For the past couple of days except yesterday Ive been either dry heaving or actually vomiting. When I vomit its either this clear liquid that tastes like acid which I assume is acid and sometimes its food I eat. Burping helps relieve the feeling for a few minutes but then its back. This has been happening for a couple of weeks already. But before I wasnt diagnosed with IBS. I had HA about colon cancer. Once I was told that it was IBS by my GI the burping never stopped but the nausea sort of did.Fast forward a little bit and I was fine. I was eating healthier and my bowel movements were even improving. I even went on a trip to Hawaii and I was fine there. I had one bout of nausea but thats it. And then shit hit the fan right when I got back from Hawaii. Basically whatever I said in the beginning lol. But heres a list of all my symptomsmedical issuesExcessive burpingfeeling like a burp is trapped in stomachchestthroatNausea due to reason aboveOccasional acid when I burp and in the morning when I wake up making me think its possibly GERD but I dont have heartburn and this feeling is only occasionaldry heavingvomiting clear liquidfood. No red blood or coffee grounds or green or yellow liquid.mild IBS no abdominal pain predominantly constipation although it has been getting better. Ive been having nice BM every day. But yesterday it was diarrhea which is weirdsometimes blood on the toilet paper but this always happens when I have to strain and it hurts and itches. GI says I have internal hemorrhoids.BM are usually 45 on the Bristol stool chartSwollen turbinate and a deviated septum ah my first bout of my HA. If I could go back in time I would prevent this lol.Fatiguesome skin patches that idk if its eczema or psoriasis. Leaning towards eczema since I have an intense family history of it.Ive had no weight loss thankfully. I actually gained weight in Hawaii haha. So its basically the burping nausea that is making my HA spike. And it sucks because it makes me anxious that I have some deadly colonstomach disease again and Ive considered making an appointment with my GI to see if I can get an endoscopycolonoscopy which he was very reluctant to do since Im 22 years old. This burping and nausea is just so annoying and depressing. I had to go home from work because of it. Ive been combating the vomiting well so far. Breathing sort of helps with nausea as well as chewing gum and ginger ale. However they havent been as effective as before. My mind is going through so many possibilities of what this could be hiatal hernia GERD postnasal drip from my nose problems a general IBS flare up a stomach ulcer my stupid anxiety or something worse. Its just so fucking scary. The only thing that makes me feel better is sleep. Please the best advice andor reassurance.,Anxiety
35509,35504,Last month filled with illness and anxiety not being able to sleep well and surgery possibly coming up. Need advice on how to cope. I've had really bad panic attacks and anxiety since I was around 14 up till the age of 16. After my first major panic attack I was hospitalized for a week after which they concluded it was anxiety and referred me to a psychiatrist. ampx200BI've essentially been free of panic attacks since but have had periods of anxiety centered around my health. ampx200BThe last month has been especially terrible. It started with an eye infection that caused an eye edema where my left eyeball developed a dent and a bump. The ambulance ride was nervewracking and I was given antibiotics at the ER and then discharged.ampx200BThen I got stomach flu. Terrible week. I felt weak dehydrated and completely sapped of all energy. More antibiotics I felt better after a few days. This is when I started to become hyperaware of my heartbeat. ampx200BThen I got sick again for 23 days fever cold sore throat. Had some relief but then went out on the weekend walked home in skimpy clothes in freezing cold and rain bronchitis for another week. ampx200BLast week I started getting wisdom tooth pain. It's an infection and abscess. Dentist said I need to have it pulled. Terrified of the surgery and especially the anesthesia. Haven't had it before scared of an allergic reaction or complications. Dental anesthesia can briefly cause palpitations which sucks because I'm so worried over the health of my heart. ampx200BAround 4 weeks of constant healthrelated drama worrying palpitations panic. The worst is probably the poor sleep. I cant fall asleep easily because I keep checking my heart rate and freak out when it slows down. My resting heart rate is around 60 so I really freak out when there's a long time between beats. This leads to palpitations poor breathing patterns tingling twitching you name it. ampx200Btldr four weeks of infections anxiety panic worrying about my heartbeat and shit sleep possibly getting wisdom tooth surgery terrified of anesthesia and related complications. I'm tired and need advice on how to cope.,Anxiety
52604,52912,Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. I'm always worrying about the future past things I can't change things I say or do after im with people how people view me if I have a too much gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it that I'll always be alone etc.It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. Money is always a bug stress factor for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me I'll stick to my same safe routine and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily. Where I do I start to fix this...?,Anxiety
34059,34078,Possible Ear Infection? So my left ear is a bit red and itchy it also feels like its burning and its tender to touch in certain places especially just before the inside of the ear and behind the ear like the rounded bit on the outside.I think it might be my earphones that have caused the problem so Ive stopped using them for a couple days.Im not sure if this is something I should go to the doctor about or not. I know ear infections and stuff dont really need treated but I wasnt sure if I should just wait it out or go see a doctor about it. ,Anxiety
34664,34672,Stomach related cancer Hey guys....I've been having problems with my stomach lately it started on September. Basically I had tons of things to do on my uni got really stressed out and started feeling like my stomach or better yet the area above it felt heavy. I started running by that time and I ran almost every day until the real winter kicked in around two month period. I also started eating more healthy and I stopped eating after 7PM for quite some time. While I ran I almost felt as if a weight was in my chest and as if it was jumping while I was running so I visited my doc.In the meantime I lost quite some weight. I was usually around 100kg 5 and last time I tracked my weight I was at 83.The doc basically said it's all stress related and she took my blood urine and stool sample.Stool gt negative for H. PyloriUrine gt everything good except high amount of proteins in urine I had wisdom teeth extracted and took antibiotics a week before so I'm not sure if it's related to that if anyone has something smart to say regarding this...please doBlood gt All goodShe gave me a prescription for Controloc pills proton pump inhibitor and told me to take them for two weeks at least.Well newsflah. I'm stupid. First of all I started taking them and the situation improved. So I stopped taking them after around 5 days forgot one day and figured oh well if it doesn't hurt it's fixed. Then another period of high intensity workload on uni arrived and so did the pain. I started taking them again but for a week and it improved a little. Later I figured I won't be my own doctor and I stopped taking them so for a while I felt just a minor annoyance above stomach but nothing alarming or hurting so I ignored it.Now back to another high intensity period my stomach is going crazy again I google telling myself not to do it but hey I said I'm stupid didn't I?The moment I read about bla bla cancers of this and that caused by gastritis I totally lost it.If I had these symptoms on and off considering I didn't take my meds as I was supposed to how bad did I fk up my stomach? Could this half a year have made any permanent damage? I'm terribly afraid of well...pain doctors disease and death nice combo in fact so nice that it keeps me scared but not scared enough to face my fear of doctors and operations.Yesterday it was hell I took 2x20mg Acipan same thing as Controloc basically and I feel a lot better but my mind is still in a terrible place. I guess this turned out into a rant rather than a question but still... any comments are welcome.sidenote I read that the usual period of taking controloc or similar pills for such symptoms is at least 4 weeks considering I didn't take even 14 of the given time is it possible it's simply the gastritis coming back every time?,Anxiety

33943,33963,Head injury worries? I constantly worry about head injuries because I constantly worry if a hit to my head was significant to cause a concussion. For example I was laying in bed on my not very heavy laptop and I accidentally pushed it into my chin. It wasn't a super hard hit it didn't hurt but I immediately started worrying that I could have a concussion. My head was against a pillow too but the reading I did claimed that it's worse if your head doesn't move.I mean I don't notice myself feeling especially nauseaous or dizzy but I can't stop worrying. It seems like most concussion stories involve something more significant than that. Are small hits like that something to worry about? Does anyone have any expertise as when to start worrying about a concussion?,Anxiety
34656,34664,Would you go to the doctor again? Alright. This is a pretty long story... I haven't had a UTI for about 5 years I'm a 27 yo F but about a month ago I was in China and got one. Went to the doctor to get antibiotics took them for 5 days. 2 days later I developed super intense middle super low abdominal pain that almost made me faint Broke out into a sweat couldn't stand ears began ringing.Went to hospital where they ran some tests and said the infection was still there so they gave me another batch of antibiotics. These made me feel super ill every night btw at this point the UTI stinging symptom is long gone and by the 5th night I felt sick af and was vomiting.Went to hospital the day after and I still had the infection. So 3rd batch of antibiotics. Went to hospital the 3rd night because I was nervous I had a UTI that lasted so long. They told me I still had an infection and that it was severe So I should stay at hospital. Didn't feel comfortable doing that in a foreign country so I got on a plane to Melbourne where I'm from the next day. Dad picked me up and took me to hospital. I did indeed still have an infection so they gave me a new batch and sent me on my way I was asymptomatic at that point. 3 days later I have muscle aches in my leg I start feeling super weak and my heart rate was really high 180 when I arrived at emergency shortly after being admitted I developed diarrhea. Doctor on duty thought I might have an undertreated UTI so they administered new antibiotic via IV. I was discharged the next morning.Considering how long this UTI lasted I followed up and had a new urine test 8 days later last Monday Called my GP's office last Wednesday and the results were normal yay! But was feeling worried because since Tuesday I felt ultra uncomfortable in that region down there. Had an ultrasound on Thursday and went back to the doctor on Friday explaining my concerns. He told me my test results from earlier in the week were completely normal so it was highly unlikely anything was wrong. Gave me some tablets they apparently usually give to old ladies with bladder issues.Started feeling okay Friday night and Saturday. This morning Sunday I woke up and started feeling the same horrible sharp pain that almost caused me to faint in China. It's right below my belly button but at the pubic bone and it's SUPER fucking sharp and intense I've taken 6 paracetamol tablets today spread out But the pain hasn't completely disappeared. All this shit is making my hypochondriac tendencies go mental. It's almost 230am and I'm struggling to sleep because I feel so uncomfortable. I saw the doctor on Friday I know but this pain is fucking intense. Am I being paranoid or should I go back to the doctor tomorrow? I feel kinda stupid because he kinda laughed me off on Friday too... but... I'd also rather be safe than sorry. What would you do? ,Anxiety
51604,51879,Asked my parents who I don't live with for an extra 10 or so a week spending money and they've turned it into a big thing I am currently under an intense care plan as an outpatient at a mental health hospital. One of the nurses suggested asking for an extra amount of allowance. 'well off' but not rich parents completely fund me while I'm at university as my loan is less than my rent.I was debating asking for weeks me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least some definitely their fault some a mix of both of our faults. Anyway it's left a gap between us that I haven't been brave enough to cross.But last night I asked them told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. IMO they've blown it way out of proportion they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me TODAY. It's sending my anxiety haywire this is why I don't open up or ask anything from my parents.What do I do? Say no to them visiting all together? I'm 100 fine with keeping the current allowance I just want a yes or a no to have some closure on this conversation with my parents.So I'll repeat my question with your limited knowledge of my life What do I do??,Anxiety

I'm guessing where my shoulder bones connect to my arm it doesn't really hurt on a regular basis in my life only when I do heavy lifting using my shoulder. The cracks are loud and my friends usually get surprised about how loud my shoulder can crack I've been debating to try to reach out to a chiropractor friend of mine but just curious to see if anyone else has experienced this! Im also pretty skinny below average weight if that could be a factor. Thanksny help,Anxiety

34329,34346,Its like I am at war with my heart Hey people. 27m here. I have had panic attacks 7 years ago. I had severe anxiety for a year then I used antidepressants got a girlfriend and stabilized my anxiety for many years. I still had episodes of severe anxietystress and depression but it never turned into full blown health anxiety that triggered panic attacks and major anxiety symptoms until recently.I have been very stressed thees past months and I finally had multiple panic attacks within the span of a month. Ended up in the ER 2 times. So as a person experienced with it I thought I can overcome it more easily and systematically this time. Took some anxiety episodes like a boss started SSRIwhich elevated anxiety so far and tried to fix things again.So my last barrier was to exercise as it had been a major weapon for me to overcome my health anxiety. Today I tried to go for a run but was breathless and my chest was hurtingdue cold I guess? I don't know pretty bad. I became anxious and dizzy. My dizziness went on for hours and I think I still have it.I am 27 and I had ECGs done during 2 of my attacks where the doctor told me it is not a heart attack this past month.But this dizziness thing and basically whenever I measure my blood pressure it turning out quiet high at around 15 910 whenever I go to a doctor to have it measured is freaking me out.I feel like my body is getting severely damaged due to my constant high blood pressure and the dizziness obviously screws my functionality. I'll go to a cardiologist regardless. I went to one 6 months ago and he told me all was fine before I was having these attacks.But is it possible to have dizziness and hbp that often with anxiety? I can often see my blood pumping in the body when this state becomes very strong. I want to get back to exercisingworking out to have a normal life but I am scared that its going to be what kills me...,Anxiety

52459,52762,A month ago I was drugged without my consent long post... TLDR Dad gave me edible without my knowledgeconsent I had a really bad trip now I don't know how to deal with it.Hey not sure if this is the best place to post this. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for exactly to vent? To know if someone had a similar experience? I don't know.Last month I was staying at my dad's house. One night I was sitting in the living room while he and his wife were in the kitchen nearby. I wasn't paying any attention to them I was playing a video game on my dad's laptop. I had headphones on with one ear uncovered because I was also watching The Simpsons. So I didn't know what they were talking about.My dad came up to me and held out what seemed to be this gummy candy. I don't remember if I asked what it was whether I did or not he was just like Try it. Now the thing about my dad is that this sort of thing isn't unusual I'm used to him making me try weird foods and such. So perhaps foolishly I ate it without really questioning it it tasted vile. It was only after I had already swallowed it that he told me it was an edible.Now another thing about him is that a lot of times he likes to mess with me. Once when I was a teenager for example he gave me a drink and told me it had alcohol when it really didn't. So I wasn't sure if he was lying or not. I knew he and his wife sometimes took edibles I just...didn't know they had any at the time. I had never done drugs before and I don't think I would have eaten it if I had known.After that he and his wife went to bed. About an hour or so passed then it began kicking in. I started feeling dizzy and I got kind of scared so I went into their bedroom and I asked my dad if it really was an edible. He said No. This was a lie but obviously I didn't know it at the time.I decided the best thing to do was try to get some sleep. There was only one bedroom so I had been sleeping on a mattress in the corner. So I was lying there crying because I had no idea if what I was feeling was because I was high or if it was all in my head.My dad's wife was also high and she started talking to me. I started laughing things got kind of funny...I started talking about all of my interests much to my dad's annoyance as he was trying to sleep and I said some really embarrassing things I later found out he had recorded at least most of what I said...well yelled 'cause apparently when I'm high I get really loud. I have selective mutism so I tend to have a lot of trouble talking if I'm not really comfortable it's gotten better over the years but my dad is convinced that I don't actually have it or something...Anyway at some point I fell asleep and had a horrible nightmare. It's hard to describe but it involved me forgetting everything...my life my interests the people I knew and the world around me...I dreamt that my dad knew I was going to forget it all and I remember the fear I felt in the nightmare. Just that feeling of...Why? Why would he do this to me? I tried to recall faces mine my dad's a musician I have a crush on yeah weird I know...and everything was warped grotesque. Everything became a black void you know that scene in Spongebob where Squidward's in that Alone place? Kind of like that except black instead of white. I began thinking that maybe I had died or was dying and that this horrible void was the afterlife.I woke up sobbing and screaming Oh God!Oh Lord! over and over and also yelling at my dad How could you do this to me!? and I will never forgive you! He and his wife got me up from the mattress and had me drink some water. Everything during this part and afterwards felt like a dream that I was trying to wake up from.My dad made me some oatmeal and put on some songs by one of my favorite artists American Murder Song. In my disoriented state I remember thinking that the first song he put on was familiar and that if I could just hang on to that familiar feeling everything would hopefully be okay. I vaguely remember singing along to the songs.After I ate he put on one of my favorite movies Repo! The Genetic Opera and left me in the living room. I remember it being on but it felt almost like I was half asleep or something throughout. I was just anxious and confused and I was trying to focus on the movie but I kept...I don't know it was like going in and out of consciousness or something. There's a scene towards the end of the movie where the main character falls unconscious and I remember vaguely wondering if perhaps I was actually her I'm a guy not that it mattered to my drugged self and that I would wake up and the movie would be reality.Apparently I also sang along to the whole move but I don't remember this my dad came into the room to check on me at some point and he said I seemed to be having a great time but I know I really wasn't. I do remember however that at some point I threw up all over myself. After the movie I told my dad I threw up and he was mad that I was too disoriented to clean it up myself. By this point about six hours had passed since I had taken the edible. I remember being so confused I asked him what day it was. After that I went back to sleep.The next day my dad told me that it really was an edible...so I did feel somewhat relieved that it was actually a drug that was making me feel that way. But for about three days afterward I still felt the affects of it...and for about a week or so I kept experience derealization.My dad's reason for giving me the edible...he said he thought it would make me talk more...which it did but it was humiliating. Apparently he and his wife had talked about what was in it before he gave me the edible but as my cousin pointed out to me it's strange to just assume that I'd be paying attention to a conversation that I wasn't even part of even if I was in the room. So he apparently thought I knew what it was...I wasn't able to go home immediately he lives in another state so he had to buy a plane ticket and all that but when I eventually did I told my mom what happened. She's furious at my dad though neither of us have spoken to him about it. I talked to my therapist about it recently but her reaction seemed...dismissive like she thought it was cool that it made me talk about my interests but again...I had no consent.So here I am exactly a month after it happened...I still experience derealization if I think about it parts of the nightmare I mentioned I literally only remembered last night.... I just...I don't know how I'm going to get over this. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to for example watch Repo! again...just recently I listened to one of the songs my dad had put on and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. I'm trying to decide whether or not to cut ties with my dad...this isn't the first time I've thought about it to be honest but I'm seriously considering it now. I just know now that thinking about that nightmare still terrifies me...,Anxiety

I would say I've been smoking since around Octber or November. I smoke maybe half a pack every other weekend if that. Maybe have one or two on the side here and there but I wouldn't consider myself a smoker. I've noticed a sore in my mouth it's all white doesn't look harmful. I think it's a canker sore as I've been drinking coffee like hell these past couple of weeks sometimes without regard for how hot it is. Is it possible to get mouth cancer after smoking maybe two or three packs of smokes in total in my life or am I just freaking out over a little blister? Thanks for the help. ,Anxiety
35585,35580,I just found out I'm diabetic. What now? Hey folks. Yesterday I went in for a routine DOT physical to get my medical card updated. These happen every two years to make sure my health is in check for driving a rig. So I go in to my appointment. I give a urine sample. There is a massive glucose concentration. They use a diabetic meter and my glucose level was a 257. With almost no symptoms apart from occasionally dry mouththirst. I went and immediately got an a1c test to determine what's going on. I understand this won't find Type I but it's worth doing. I've taken my blood sugar three times since. Last test yesterday was still in the 250s today it's been 157 for two tests.I'm worried. I enrolled in insurance yesterday because I'm not financially prepared for the lab work but I cannot continue driving until this is diagnosed and handled. I bought a bike to start trying to get my weight down and keep active. I'm internally freaking out right now. I've always had good health minus a little extra weight. Any advice? Thanks ,Anxiety

34193,34212,Terrified of PCOS For the past 7 months the fear of developing PCOS has taken over me despite have no symptoms. Ive always had normal periods. They always come every 28 days and last for 5. Not only that but Ive always been skinny I havent had a bad acne breakout since I was 14 I dont get any facial hair aside from a little on my upper lip and I dont think its possible for me to have diabetes. But I gained 3 pounds this month. And my period started yesterday and then completely stopped. So now Im convinced I have it and I cant think about anything else. The last time PCOS fears struck me I had two panic attacks in a row and was a state of high stress for a while. My period ended up coming a week and a half early which just made the anxiety worse. Eventually everything went back to normal but for some reason Im convinced that wont happen this time. I know PCOS is not a death sentence but I have never worried so much about an illness ,Anxiety
34540,34553,So worried any ideas what could be wrong? Hi everyone so basically for the paat month i've woke up everyday with headaches mostly tension headaches and the feeling of pressure. I also get flashes of light in my vision chills and a tingly feeling going through my whole body also pain in my arms and slight numbness in my fingers. 2 weeks ago i vomited aswell which really didn't help matters as i have a fear of vomiting.Im convinced i have a brain tumor but i went to the doctor and he shone a light into my eyes and said everything looked ok but i still dont believe him. I've have headaches from anxiety on and off in the past but they never lasted this long before.The last 2 months have been really stressful for me as my mum was in hospital with liver failure and i had to look after my dad during that time who is a schizophrenic. My anxiety was improving but this has brought me back down and i feel worse than ever.Does anybody know what it could be? Is it a stress reaction or could i really have a brain tumor? ,Anxiety

Ok so I was reading online about the Rombergs test where you stand with your two feet together and fold your arms then close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for at least 20 seconds. I can do this fine.Then the Sharpened Rombergs test. Stand with your heel to the big toe of the opposite foot heel to toe put your hands on your hips and close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for 2131 seconds. Sometimes I can do like 1.5 minutes other times I can only do like 15 seconds. Then the big one. Standing on one leg with your eyes closed for 1530 seconds. Stand on your good foot lift the other foot while bending it has to be at least 6 inches off the ground. I CANT DO IT.

51685,51961,College Student w Anxiety Dating Life I first developed severe anxiety and panic disorder in my senior year of high school. I can proudly say that with perseverance proper medication and the help of my lovely therapist family and friends I was able to complete my senior year and begin college in the fall. Ive taken a liking to this guy in my class and we will hang out this weekend. I am very inexperienced in the dating world as Ive only really gone out with three guys ever none of which lasted more than a few months. Though I had not been diagnosed with anxiety in my sophomore year of high school I began dating this guy whom I was pretty infatuated with. However the first time he put his arm around me I shook uncontrollably. I misread that as a sign that he wasnt suitable for me when it was just anxiety. Fast forward to now I am anxious about seeing this guy this weekend and I am scared that these feelings of fear wont go away even if we continue to see each other. Has anyone else been through this? What should I do? I dont want to be limited from dating but l my body is giving me unclear signals of what to do.,Anxiety
34709,34717,Health anxiety when sick Hi everyone I've had issues with GAD for the past 10 years it's something I've learned a lot from and managing it usually is not terrible difficult. In late November I came down with a cold which in turn became a sinus infection. I've had seminoticeable issues with my sinuses for the past two years but nothing crazy mainly decreased sense of smell and having a stuffy nose. During this time I became paranoid of various fatal diseases I had a ton of different symptoms some that can be related to sinus stuff some anxiety things. I've had a few ups and downs throughout the last month and a bit at one point having almost a full week anxiety free. Anyways do you guys have any recommendations for dealing with HA when you have an actual medical thing going on with it's own symptoms? I am currently paranoid about some kind of Bacterial Meningitis which while being rational is kind of a ridiculous fear. Going to the doctor is also a bit of a challenge I can't get a GP in my city In Canada and have to use health clinics. I haven't had any of the super thorough scans tests etc. Which also makes me a little paranoid even though I know it's recommended not to go down that rabbit hole. I feel like my mind gets incredibly caught up in that minuscule chance that it's something serious and my ignoring it is going to be the nail in the coffin. I also just wanted to mention that I know this is a positive experience for me even though it's kind of miserable. I don't want to be overly negative as I have had my good days during all of this and I try to keep positive even when things seem incredibly bleak and dreary. ,Anxiety

52570,52879,Advice Ive been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life. Ive had lots of trama and was diagnosed with ADHD as a young child. Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive in school. I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations chest pain shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didnt believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is Im very worried Im developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if Im worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But Im just looking for advice.EditI would like to add that for a long time when I went home after a long day I could not relax to fall asleep. My mind would be racing. The only way I could describe it is like a radio. In order to drown it out I would have to put on music to fall asleep.,Anxiety

34142,34161,My HIV hypochondria is acting up again Hey guysSo I had been sleeping with this guy Rob on and off since 2016 and around August last year I started to get anxious about his status after stalking his exes facebook. I noticed she had cold sores on her lips and the last time I saw her in 2015 I saw her with cold sores. At first I thought it was normal because lots of people have and get cold sores but when I saw a recent picture of her on Facebook with the same if not worse cold sores. This concerned me because to my knowledge only people who are immuno compromised get recurring cold sores that often. I had spoken to Rob about his status earlier and he assured me he was healthy and I chose to believe him but after speaking to one of my girl friends she was surprised at how quick I was to believe him. She said verbatim guys can lie and I don't trust these uni boys keep in mind I live in Kenya where HIV is prevalent. This comment really freaked me out and I was sure he lied to me. I started freaking out and going crazy because of the picture of his ex coupled with my friend's comments I was sure I had contracted the virus. At this time I started sending him cryptic messages alluding to him infecting me but he didn't get which then forced me to plainly ask Are you HIV positive? He quickly replied No I'm not. I checked you also checked and I went and got tested and my results returned negative this wasn't a rapid test it was the one you wait two days for. I felt so bad about accusing him and we stopped speaking. Skip forward 3 months and we start fucking again. We met up and fucked 2 more times before I officially ended it for good. Now my mind is going back to thoughts that I'm HIV positive again. I keep thinking that maybe the first 6 times we met up and fucked the virus missed me and on the last 7th and 8th time the virus may have stuck. Is that possible? TLDR Had been hooking up with a guy since Dec 2016 and started getting anxious about his HIV status. Got tested in August 2017 and results came back negative. Started fucking him again in October 2017 and stopped in November. Is it possible that he is positive and the virus missed me the first 6 times we fucked and got me the last two times we did it? ,Anxiety

Daily marijuana pack of cigarettes a day drinking 56 nights a week MDMA every weekend. It was intense. I was on Zoloft at the time for my anxiety and depression due to a crappy upbringing and social anxiety.Flash forward to now. Quit pills 4 years ago quit weed 1.5 years ago quit cigarettes a month ago and now only drink once or twice a week. HOWEVER. Since getting healthier and stopping substances my body has freaked out and feels like complete garbage every day. I have constant heart palpitations tingling and headaches. I've had ECGs a brain CAT scan MRI on my chest lung xray blood pressure monitor and numerous blood tests and literally they can't find anything wrong with me. I am sad because I feel worse now than I ever did during my party days and according to doctors I am in great shape considering. Also go to the gym 34 days a week.

35483,35479,Brain Tumor Concerns Ive been feeling super anxious lately and thought it would be worth venting out at the moment. Im M20 years old and Ive been feeling anxious over the idea of a brain tumor. Headaches have been presentish but theyve been minor. I wouldnt call them the worst headaches in my life. I feel like Ive been seeing tiny streaks of light? Its not huge glares or anything that has messed up my vision but I feel like I see tiny streaks sometimes. I sometimes feel like I have double vision when reading? But that might be just a me problem since I need glasses. Left eyelid has a small twitch. Though the right eyelid has been starting a bit too. Been waking up earlier than normal. Not sure if my speech always had me stuttering. Might be overthinking it. My ears have been ringing for a while now. I havent vomited or suffered any seizures yet.I dunno if I can chalk this up to allergies since they hit hard this season. I just need comfort that this isnt a reason to panic. This anxiety has been really messing me up and even if Im going to the doctor in two weeks Im a bit concerned for my health.,Anxiety
34207,34226,Someone please help First of all I urge anyone who reads this to please give an opinion on what they think it may be I'm worried sick. Thanks in advance.Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.I'll get straight to it here are symptoms with context Odd feeling on left side of body mainly legs only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it really odd and it scares me. Tinnitus already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence. Constipation probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems. Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. A feeling that for some reason I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this the never being able to relax I feel on edge 247. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred or check my heartrate to check for palpitations or check my typing to check for strokeALS. I seriously can't keep living like this why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!Many thanks Max,Anxiety

34048,34067,I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 56 years now however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.About a year and a half ago I started saying 'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden I still say it sometimes but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness shortness of breath chest pains headaches shaking etc. I knowhope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind. ,Anxiety

My personal favorite is the TIP acronym cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute paced breathing or breath work sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic. Just thought I'd share if anyone is looking for ideas. Love you all lt3,Anxiety
51870,52149,Feeling overwhelmed and uncomfortable in my body right now I dont really dont know how to describe this. But I just genuinely have that feeling like on the verge of exploding. Like Im so exhausted and dissatisfied with my life. And right now I just feel so uncomfortable in my own skin like I just dont even want to be in my body anymore. Just the feelings that arise from not having a support system experiencing chronic pain trauma and not getting what I want in life academically socially etc. is just all coming to a head. Life just feels so unfair sometimes. Like Im having to work twice as hard as other people in my life and Im just drowning. But when I complain or ask for help people brush me off or call me over dramatic. Meanwhile everyone is always expecting me to play superhero for them in their own lives. Its just making feel so wound up and tense. And I dont really know how else to describe it but I cant even focus on work right now.,Anxiety

34251,34269,I 28F Health anxiety Help. How did you get over it? Health anxiety SUCKS. Like really sucks. I literally have no reason in my current life to be so down sometimes but I am and I hate it. I'm literally crying. My grandmother two of her sons and one of my female cousins have diabetes. My mom does not and neither does my 14 year old sister. I'm 28 eat relatively healthy but was pretty sedentary up until 3 weeks ago. I weigh 151.7 and I've started exercising 6 days per week 1 hour Zumba super high intensity with plyometrics incorporated and have felt pretty great. I have remained at around the same weight despite all of this. I went out last Thursday about a week ago and got drunk which I never really do. I rarely drink but I felt so terrible and I'm not doing that again. I was super dehydrated and felt like crap all weekend but I still went to Zumba that Saturday. Out of nowhere I start thinking about diabetes and now I'm freaked the heck out. I went through all of my medical records from the past couple of years to try to calm me down fasting glucose at 96 at 78 at 87 most recent in December 2017 was 96. On 552016 my a1c with eAG estimation was 5.0 and my a1c today was 4.9. I did eat a small tub of mangoes from HEB and a green juice prior to my glucose test and that came back at 148. This was literally 1015 mins after eating. I've had some random shooting pain all over my body for a while now and for the past couple of days Sunday I have cold feet I cannot warm up at all. Granted my whole legs hurt and they feel cold from my butt down. My muscles are pretty sore as I've been doing squats and jumping all over the place for an hour daily. I took a rest day today. I seem to find charts and charts about normal diabetic ranges but not normal non diabetic ranges for immediately post meal and that 148 is freaking me out despite of the a1c level.Should I be worried? Also I started new birth control Vienva generic for Aviane and I think this may be causing the cold feet? and maybe the anxiety to go to extremes? I asked the Dr. on Nurx about the birth control and she said it's not a normal side effect of the medication although it is my experience that sometimes they aren't aware of all. My health anxiety started about two years ago with a diagnosis of H. Pylori which has been resolved naturally as the Flagyl and antibiotics caused the first ever anxiety bout I've ever had and continues today. I also had my gallbladder removed and then went to a gastro who said I didn't even need it taken out despite pain attacks. I've had EKG's Echo CT of the pelvis and abdomen with contrast ad I was also getting palpitations. Determined those are PVC's but I did not want to take beta blockers if nothing is structurally wrong with my heart. I just want to be the old me. Three year ago me who gave no fucks about anything until that shit. TLDR Is it diabetes or just health anxiety? Help! I want to be the old me ,Anxiety
52586,52894,Had a really bad turn the last few days Hi everyone I've had anxiety for the last 6 months or so in varying levels. From January I was in a decent headspace with it but the last three weeks it's got worse and then the last four days or so it's gone off a cliff. It's all I think about all day long I had panic attacks on Monday and Wednesday and my heart is racing all day. Where before I'd wake up rested now I wake up with my heart racing and frequently my muscles are spasming which is scary. The thought of doing normal stuff feels impossible and I can't shake this feeling I can't get better than this ever again. I spoke to my doctor on Thursday and he prescribed propranolol which I took yesterday for the first time which helped with the body stuff but my mind was still racing.Has anyone experienced similar and have any tips? I feel like this is really really bad and worse than most people have anxiety.,Anxiety
33970,33990,I finally saw the cardiologist today I had multiple ECGs bloodwork done I wore a twoweek loop and I had an echocardiogram over a month ago and today I did a stress test. I've been having HORRIBLE anxiety about my heart for over a month and a half. My heart is completely healthy. No blockages and no damage to it whatsoever. This is one of my happier days!!! They told me the chest pain which I can reproduce by touching it is likely caused by either anxiety or costochondritis and the heavy tightness is likely anemia which I can deal with much better than heart disease. The left arm pain is probably from inflammation because I lay on it so awkwardly and for too long at night. I'm OK ' Anxiety is a bitch guys. It can make you truly believe and FEEL the most frustrating and uncomfortable symptoms. I'm not saying to dismiss everything as anxiety it will always be better to see a doctor but what I am saying is none of you are alone. Thanks to everyone here who supported me through this. I can move on and focus on fixing my inflammation and anemia!! ,Anxiety

35300,35299,Mono nightmare Towards the beginning of 2019 I began feeling something weird in my throat as if a ball of mucus was stuck there. I thought it was allergies but never took any allergy medication. Fast forward to 1 week ago where I'm following a terrible flipped sleep schedule going to sleep at 10am and waking up at 6pm. I woke up at 4pm one day and was so tired that I ended up falling asleep at 10pm. After getting 9 hours of sleep I still remained tired throughout the day. I assumed it was due to my sudden shift in sleep schedules but the daytime fatigue continued. Eventually I scheduled a physical exam to see what was going on all while assuming the absolute worst case scenario. The doctor brought up mono as a possibility but I didn't think much of it.ampx200BAgain fast forward to today I receive a call from the doctor saying that my bloodwork came back positive for mono. I was shocked. But for some reason I've been having a heartchest pain that pops up for a few seconds at different times throughout the day and almost as it were to perfectly coincide with my diagnosis. Now there are some complications with mono such as heart inflammation however they are said to be quite rare. My hypochondria is immediately assuming that I am one of those rare cases and have developed a viral heart disease. Does anyone have an experience similar to this with mono? I would love to hear about it. ,Anxiety

I scraped off the top layer and the yogurt underneath seemed fine so I ate it but now I cant stop thinking about the possibility it might have been bad.

I searched up about health anxiety and read that a very common symptom is pins and needles which i am feeling a lot. Every time i hear those two diseases or even read them i always get butterflies in my stomach. By the way in the past i have also had worries about my health. I have had worries about my shoulder since it was starting to become numb and the joint clicking exactly in the spot that i had fell on a few years back playing soccer. I also had big worries that i had cubital tunnel syndrome since i was feeling numb in my pinky for two weeks. Another thing to note is that my grandma has always had the same problem about how shes always anxious about her health so i dont know if it could be inherited behavior or something like that.

35555,35550,Am I Going Crazy? So Im a healthy 27 year old American woman today is my birthday and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I cant seem to get a grip on anything. For reference it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldnt seem to go away. Im currently living in Spain which is where Im currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted lots of mucus coming out constipation tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldnt see clearly but my other organs looked good. But then my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool found something that looked like a worm went to the emergency room tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved.Just after my first dose of mebendazole I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldnt breathe in all the way but that was it. Anyway in addition to that I began to have sinus pressure a mild sore throat and drainage. I took my second dose of the worm medicine had a stool sample that came back clear of everything no blood and even a chest Xray that was clear. Ive been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up Ive been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I havent been able to completely shake this cold yet and its been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse Im still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then last night I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly I just feel like Im shutting down and I havent felt healthy in a long time. I cant seem to shake this chest cold my digestive problems are still there have some reflux too and now pvcs. I feel like Im a mess... just spent the morning of my 27th birthday in the emergency room getting the tests on my heart. Can anyone relate?,Anxiety

35620,35615,Anxiety over therapy Hii! I live in Belarus and in my country there are no CBT practitioners. All our doctors can offer is pills. Maybe talking therapy. I don't want to spend my time just talking about my anxiety it's not gonna help. I've been struggling with anxiety throughout my life. I had OCD sometimes still have it but overcame it on my own using Internet and articles of Dr. Steven Phillipson. I had GAD just general anxiety 247 and overcame it by accepting using the book by Claire Weekes Hope and help for your nerves. Now I suffer from severe health anxiety. I've read some books and other sufferers on forums told me some techniques. What I've been using is more ACT acceptance and commitment therapy than CBT. And it was quite helpful for me. I have always had problems challenging the thought it's much easier to accept it and let it float past me as clouds as just anxiety. Lately I've read on Wikipedia that CBT is a goldstandard approach. And developed anxiety what if yess classic whatif thought the approach you've been using is wrong and is not recognized by therapists?. I lack confidence although I have tools. But I continue googling. I understand this is just another anxiety about the therapy maybe a sign I'm recovering.,Anxiety
52438,52738,Questions for new anxiety sufferer... Does anybody's anxiety present with just the following symptomsChest TightnessTightness in the front of the neck and under the chinLightheadednessDizzinessFeeling FaintLike I may pass outNauseaThese are the symptoms I've been feeling. I don't really seem to have an impending sense of fear or doom when these things happen but I will say they are triggered by talking about my condition or just general stress but sometimes they happen for no reason at all. I have just been sitting watching TV playing a video game or scrolling through Reddit and they've happened.I've been to the ER three times at two different hospitals in the past week with these symptoms in addition to high blood pressure and all three times my blood work and ECG have been normal.I need to add a lot of these symptoms got worse when lying down and got better when sitting up or walking.In light of that last detail the ER doctors said it's just GERD and sent me home with orders for a PPI medication and a Blood Pressure medication.Well the GERD has improved and all the symptoms I've listed above have improved as well but haven't gone away.I'm seeing an anxiety doctor later this week and out of an abundance of caution a cardiologist later next month soonest they could get me inAnother detail I received a call from the doctor earlier telling me my cholesterol was high and my potassium was a little high from the Lisinopril BP med so they started me on a diuretic and a cholesterol medication. As soon as I got off the phone with that news I instantly started feeling the pressure in my neck and chest... This is what leads me to believe my symptoms are anxiety related.TLDR Asking about all of your symptoms to see if mine line up with anxiety or not.,Anxiety
35833,35828,Is this shingles? Please help me So for a few days Ive had aches on the right side of my upper chest and under my right shoulder blade. Last night I decided to use nutmeg balm to try and soothe the ache. This morning when I woke up and checked myself in the mirror I had this rashhttpsimgur.comaz5TaEWc on the right side of my back on the shoulder blade.The rash doesnt hurt when I touch it and doesnt seem irritated. The only places which hurt are where my muscle ache is the rash does not cover those areas at all. If its shingles normally does the rash itself hurt when you touch it? Im confused to whether it actually is shingles or maybe just a reaction to the nutmeg balm. Ive used it before and never had a rash afterwards but after I applied the balm on my back last night I was sitting on a bare mattress duvet and pillows maybe it could be a reaction to that also?Please let me know if you have had similar experiences or if I should go see a doctor. Right now the rash doesnt give me any pain or irritation the only pain I have is from the aches on my chest and back that were there before the rash,Anxiety

I visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right but he didn't know why. He assumed that its something I've always had but only noticed now but that's impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke hello health anxiety. a few days before the uneven pupils I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear usually pulsatile rushing noise. I'm afraid its either a carotid dissectionstroke or some sort of tumor. Maybe I had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue? Anyway I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had weird eye issues or fears. Its tough to have all these thoughts in my head without anyone listening or taking them seriously. ,Anxiety
34872,34879,Rabies HA is driving me batty Hi fellow anxiety sufferersI've been good for months but my HA has decided to welcome the new year with a flare up. A few nights ago I was reading in my bedroom with the window open when I heard some rustlingflapping at the curtain. I went to take a look and couldn't see anything except for two large geckos. I guess they could have been chasing each other on the curtain causing the rustling but who knows.ampx200BAnyway I went back to the bed and was facing away from the window with my hand resting behind my head when I felt a sharp sensation in one of my fingers. I looked around and couldn't see anything and there were no puncture wounds or marks on my hand.ampx200BLong story kinda short I've convinced myself that a rabid bat flew into my room snuck up on me nipped my finger and then ninja'ed itself away this despite there being no actual sighting of a bat or any wound.ampx200BI realise how irrational and ridiculous this all sounds but nonetheless the fear of dying from rabies is real and it's driving me a little nutty. ampx200BJust to mention that I don't live in a rabies hot spot the incidence of rabies in humans from bat bites in my country is very low and apparently fewer than 0.5 of the bat population is rabid. So...ampx200BI really just want to go get some rabies shots but I reckon my doctor will think I'm nuts. Any advice on how to deal with this anxiety or any words to help put my mind at ease would be much appreciated!,Anxiety

35117,35118,ALS Fear Sending My Life In A Downward Spiral. I don't know where to to turn other then to people who may be able to relate to me. Every second of the day lately I have it in my head that I am going to pass away from ALS shortly. It all started about 1 2 weeks ago. I started having muscle twitches in my right arm and right thigh and when I bend over to pick something up or when I squat my right thigh muscles twitch and tremor uncontrollably. A few google searches later ALS is popping up all over the place. It's been a constant worry now with every 5 10 minutes me getting up out of my chair to test my strength in my right leg. But every time I squat or try to balance on my right leg and bend at the knee the tremors and twitches trigger in my right thigh like crazy. I have really horrible HMO insurance and it takes anywhere from 35 weeks for me to see a Primary Care Physician. I have an appointment for 4 weeks from now with my PCP. But until then all I can do is sit back and hope for the best but expect the worst. I am in in a massive downward spiral now. I can't do anything but sit on my computer and research ALS. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because in my head I want life to move as slowly as possible just incase I have not a lot of time left on this earth. I don't know where else to turn. I am so so so scared. 28 year old Male. Thank you anyone and everyone who took the time to read this. Idk what writing my thoughts down will do but I hope I can soak in some positive vibes.,Anxiety
35641,35636,I am doing much better! Hey guys had an awful panic attack that sent me to the ER back in August and started a whole slew of anxiety related problems and oh boy I don't wish this upon anyone. So I have had pretty much every symptom under the sun from anxiety and SSRI medication. I could barely function work study I couldn't leave the house. Then the health anxiety started up and I wa sure I was dying all the time. Pain would be all over the place and move around and change the type of pain. All just anxiety. Life was brutal. But since we rarely see posts on this. I AM DOING WAY BETTER!!! I feel like my normal self and honestly feel like i am a better person I am much more compassionate sympathetic and understanding because of my experiences. And for everyone battling anxiety I know it can feel hopeless but you can get better. Take things one day at a time. Just try to do 1 thing better everyday. ,Anxiety

34087,34106,Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub but I really need to vent. I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However I live in Florida and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.Edit to add It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 19 days after infection so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.,Anxiety

35747,35742,I'm getting a colonoscopy and I'm freaking terrified I've had minor GI bleeding for a while that warrants a colonoscopy. I want to do it because at the very least it'll give me a peace of mind but it's the biggest procedure I've had so far in my life and the first time I'll be under sedation so I'm absolutely freaking out. I'm 25 people my age don't usually go under colonoscopies so it's kind of hard to talk about this with others. Even the prep alone sounds awful thanks to all the horror stories. I know it's a routine procedure for folks way older than me but I'm still pretty scared. Has anyone here gotten a colonoscopy at a young age? One of the things that concerns me is that I've heard people who have IBS have worse symptoms after the procedure likely due to the prep.,Anxiety

Im currently on 2 medications buspirone propranolol. My friend is aware of my anxiety and noticed that this week it has been particularly high. Anyways today I went a bit mute I cant find the energy to talk and its hard to communicate how Im feeling. So today in lab my friend was getting frustrated because she was hungry from not eating all day. And when lab was over I kind of rushed out because I felt a panic attack going on. I went to the bathroom to put cold water on my face. She got angry at me texting me saying where the fuck are you? And when she found me she sat there with a look on her face. I told her she can go to the dining hall but instead she went back to the lab classroom and started to talk shit about me to our lab partner. So now Im currently sitting here too afraid to even talk to anyone I just wish I could get rid of this. I hate feeling this way and making everyone around me upset.,Anxiety

Every single damn time I end up at a specialist and get a bunch of expensive tests just to find out nothing's wrong. It's all in my head. I have an appointment with an allergist next week to find out what caused a bad reaction... But now all I can think is that the reaction was not real. It was probably just a panic attack. I'm sure all the tests will come back normal again and I'll be left with regret and a big bill as I'm reminded that I'm still just a hypochondriac.,Anxiety

52250,52546,how do i calm down when i get anxious while studying? due to mental health i've been slightly struggling with uni studies lately. part of why i'm mentally not doing well is because i've grown up with a rather abusive father and one of the things that he's really forced on me has been to do well in studies like that's just something that's been going on since i started schoolso this brings me to how extremely anxious i get while studying which usually is at home. it can take a while or it can take a few minutes but majority of the times i get so extremely anxious or just straight up have a panic attack in the middle of it. the part that causes this isn't that 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll struggle even more with uni' but 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll en up in trouble by my dad'ultimately i know it's always gonna be 'study for your own sake not anyone else's' but after growing up with a father that's so abusive in so many ways it's hard to not make that association and just break out until i can't even focus on studyingso my question is making that association or not does anyone have any advice on how i at the very least can calm down or put myself at ease when this happens while studying?,Anxiety

51713,51989,Anticipatory anxiety ruined my chance at a vacation. I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing. 28M.I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel wellprepared to take headon especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.Specifically I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fightflight responses around takeoff and aviophobia or fears when the plane is in the air. I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. But as I lay on my side writing this I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.It's crazy I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight to sleep to cry to indulge in selfhatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today because it was not going to get done. I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear it.I still want to fly deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.,Anxiety

52669,52978,Politics has made me anxious again I just want something to finally go right. Hello.So my country is going to have an election in the fall. Politics used to stress me out much more in the past I've since then cut a lot of the sites that were stressing me out and most days I feel pretty good and don't really worry about it that much. My country has been ruled by religious extremists who are incredibly bigoted for eight years now I'm so tired of their constant discriminatory comments blatant disregard for any sort of decency and integrity and they overall just make me so tired and anxious and sad. They've started to rule when I was a teen and I'm a young adult and they're still at the helm. It seems like they will win this year again and another even more extreme religious conservatist party has a chance at becoming the third biggest power.I fell into a mental hole and I can't get out of it. I know that the elections will be in the fall and it's early spring but I just feel so depressed and powerless. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to and that it will always just be horrible.

33929,33949,Trying a new way of thinking. My day normally looks something like this...Oh man I'm dizzy. I wonder what that means. Any my left arm is weak. Is that a heart attack? Maybe a symptom of a small heart attack? Where did I get that bruse on my knee? Is that a sign of a blood clot? Should I go to the doctor again? Last time he told me to stop worrying about stuff like this. Is that a lump I'm the back of my head? Maybe that's what's causing my head ache... But what is the lump is another sign of a problem? Should I start documenting this? The doctor thinks I'm crazy but if I have all the symptoms with the times I had them he could surly run more tests. A friend I knew died for a blood clot that the doctors missed maybe my doctor missed something... etcRecently I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.So I'm going to try that method. Oh I guess I have a headache today. And try to leave it at that. If it lasts a week all the talk to my doctor.Has anyone had success doing something like this? Like just changing the way you thought?,Anxiety

35701,35696,I'm a lot scared about my mom's lower leg pain Hi! First of all I made a second account to talk about these personal issues I use my personal account which has my real name for a lot of public things and didn't feel comfortable in sharing those personal issues there.ampx200BMy mom had breast cancer six years ago and treated it successfully doing chemo and radiotherapy. Fortunately it was diagnosed very early. She is totally cured now and constantly monitors her breast and thyroid which she had some benign cysts. She is 60 and doesn't smoke or drink at all.ampx200BLast week she removed a dot on her face. The biopsy returned Basal Cell Carcinoma but with no spread on close lymphs. The dermatologist said it was nothing to worry about.ampx200BBut yesterday she said she had been felling pain around the tibia for about a year and half. It's a pain she feels deep that comes for some time like a week then disappear for some months then comes back. It doesn't seem to be affected by exercise but hurts at night. While she was pressing the region to show me where it was she said she could feel it hurt a little even if at that moment it wasn't hurting the way it used to. There is no swelling at all and she said it never was. She also said the pain is the same since it begun. ampx200BAnd she had been having some cramps a while ago the doctors said it could be a neuropaty caused by the medications she took like tamoxifen. She also said these cramps usually stops when this pain begins.ampx200BShe said she's worried about it being a bone metastasis from the breast cancer.ampx200BFrom what I know it's extremely unlikely that a metastasis from a cancer she treated back in 2013 and which in that time had no secondary tumor detected could only appear now. ampx200BBut I'm extremely worried about other cancer possibilities. Like a primary bone cancer or a secondary cancer from a hidden tumor that originated in other part of the body.ampx200BThe rational part of me says it's probably neuropaty or even some other symptom caused maybe by her age and if that pain was bone cancer she probably would be gone now or at least the pain would have gotten worse after all this time or even some swelling would have appeared.ampx200BBut the other part the same that worried about me having ALS because of some twitches says it could be cancer. She has an appointment with the same doctor that treated her cancer on Monday but until then I can't help but be terrified about this possibility.ampx200BHas anyone had any similar experience? Is the rational part of me probably right once again?,Anxiety

At the beginning it was fine but now Im starting to feel it again Im scared Im being too needy for him and that when I tell him I can talk hes gonna tell me he realized he doesnt like me so much anymore and we should breakup. Rationally I DOUBT this is gonna happen but I cant help but thinking its my fault?!? I feel so guilty.,Anxiety

52351,52652,Wedding speech in a few days social anxiety So Ive always had an aspect of social anxiety within me usually in groups of more than 3 or 4 people. One on one or in a group of 3 in absolutely fine.I had some bad experiences of speeches and presentations back in high school and totally avoided it throughout my adult life.Im now 31 and the only public speaking if you can calll it that Ive done is a hand full of interviews to no more than 3 people. Im my brothers best man at his wedding in a few days and Ive got to do it in front of 100 or so people which seems absolutely alien to me. My heart races and I get sweaty palms just thinking about it or practicing in front of a mirror. I hate the sound of my own voice and it just begins to breakshake and I go bright red and my mouth makes this involuntary frowning thing like Im about to cry whenever Ive had to do it in the past. Ive read online countless tips and advice but I just dont feel these people have it half as bad as I do? Ive resorted to getting a low dose of diazepam from my doctor only 6 2mg tablets and they have told me to take a maximum of 3 of theses before the speech. Will this honestly help? I appreciate the concerns about mixing alcohol and diazepam but I do believe that is a low dose and I only plan on having 1 or 2 small bottles of beer before the speech.Any tipsadvice? TIA.,Anxiety

I guess its not possible to know. I just ate fast food for the first time in a while which seemingly cause my blood pressure to spike. My heart rate was up as if I was on a brisk walk for an hour despite just sitting and doing deep breathing exercises. It was probably just all of the excess sodium but I just couldnt calm myself back down for anything. I know that digestion in general will cause a higher heart rate but when my head starts to feel hot and tight like a balloon I just have a hard time shaking the idea that something bad is about to happen.Doing fine now just thought Id share in case anyone has a similar thing.

35541,35536,Heart palpitations So I started having heart palpitations when I was younger got it checked it was just an atrial flutter so nothing. Last year I was jacked up on caffeine and I'd say a little depressed and I had a stimulant induced panic attach felt like I was gonna die. Quit caffeine and could workout and everything like normal. A few weeks later I had a night of binge drinking and woke up at 5 am to my heart pounding out of my chest which sent me into another panic attack. Now whenever my heart rate goes up whether working out or drinking I start to get anxiety and feel like I'm just gonna drop dead. Has anyone else had this?,Anxiety

I get super anxious about them but really I only notice them if I start to look. I went to my optometrist last Friday and he said that everything looked normal in my eyes at the time. But when I get anxious about them a lot I feel like I notice little pin pricks of light in my vision and other symptoms but no loss of peripheral vision.

52213,52508,SSRIs I had a drs appt this AM before work about starting meds for anxiety. Im anxious about taking meds in general and dont want to take SSRIs. Long story short I came prepared and specifically asked for one of two meds wellbutrin and buspar. The dr supervising physician refused to prescribe either. One bc im at a high risk of seizures bc family history alcoholism other meds... that was the one I wanted most bc it does depression anxiety adhd and helps w nicotine alcohol cessation. The other one was the only other anxiety med I was willing to try and they said no bc it doesn't treat depression only anxiety. The hypothesis is that my severe anxiety is the only reason I am able to function with slightlylesssevere depression so they don't want to prescibe it bc the fear is if they treat the anxiety but not the depression I will quickly spiral into a deep depression.I haven't felt this depressed in quite a while. I don't want to take an SSRI and it feels like my only option is that or panic attacks wherein I get so stressed out my blood pressure rises high enough to give me nosebleeds like an anime character.,Anxiety
34280,34297,Throat IssuesFears This is my first time posting on this subreddit... I've had some nasty health anxiety that's been going on since I had brief exposure to asbestos tile about a month ago during some home renovation. Ever since then I've been convinced that I've acquired cancer of the mouththroat. I recently went to the dentist to check out some mouth sores and bumps and they were found to be nothing. For the last week and a half I've had some issues with what feels like swallowing on my right side of my throat. No real pain but also no lumps or bumps in my throat or neck to speak of. Recently though I chose to feel in the back of my throats and felt what feels like cartilagebone on the right side of my throat. It is a hard ridge and doesn't appear on my left side. I don't have any pain and haven't had any other symptoms to speak of. I'm wondering If anyone would have any idea what this is or maybe it's just normal and I'm overly paranoid due to my recent health anxiety. My fianc is a PA student and hasn't been overly concerned at all and at my physical a month ago a blood test showed normal white blood cell count. I still can't stop thinking it's cancer though and really looking for advicehelp on this. I've been through a lot of stress lately and just looking for some support. Any thoughts help or support would be much appreciated. ,Anxiety
34682,34690,Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering coldlike viral symptoms for the last 10 days and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat but has now progressed to a hacking productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today although admittedly it feels muscular.Roughly 4 days into my symptoms 6 days ago now I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning. I mean as a health anxiety sufferer whose condition arises from a fear of death this is the worst illness I ever could've learned about. ,Anxiety

51727,52003,Is it AnxietyBurnout and why do my neckbackchest pains haven't stopped ever since august 2022 Disclaimer the post is slightly copy paste from this thread but I want to share this on many threads in order to get some help. I'm M 33years oldWhat's really interesting is every single described on this thread are almost identical to the ones I I have right now so if you can please check them out so you understand what I am going trough.httpswww.reddit.comrcostochondritiscommentsjrihv6chestpainformonthsnoanswers?xpromoedpenabled The only logical explanation I've found myself is that it might be severe Anxiety or Burnout I've experienced which makes my muscles being tense up all the time without me even realising it and get inflamed by the constant stress.As well some people from what I've googled claim that it might be side effect after a COVID infection around June 2022 but oddly enough my wife is totally fine despite both of us having similar symptoms while we were sick I got headaches and my throat hurt her throat hurt and she was tired both of us were 3x vaccinated. The only reason why I rule it out is because these pains did start 2 days after my bed broke down while I was lying on it August 2022 and we changed the bed mattress afterwards around october 2022 but we've slept on the couch that can be transformed into a bed which is literally a wooden plank with the old mattress on top of it that was way overdue had a hole in the middle so had to change it for almost 3 months.Before this all happend I was really really stressed for years because of tons of private issue that negatively impacted my mental health and I was inactive during the lock down 2020 and after losing my job june 2021 I've been almost every day on the PC with bad posture probably from 2019 June 2022. I got now a new job in september 2022 but got laid off from a previous one I was in for 3 months around January 2022Also I was on Amitriptyline 25mg for almost a year and stopped taking them as my neurologist told me back than June 2022 I used to have around 2021 iirc similar painstingles on the left side of my body but not like the ones I have right now.I do really hope if anyone finds out what we can do do finally feel better beside accepting our symptoms and live with them. I have the typical tingly electric feelings around my left side headaches migraines heart races burningcold feeling on one foot or both etc these symptoms typical come when I feel really anxious. Now all the symptoms seems to focus on ChestPainNeck Pain with Brain Fog with especially when the pains are strong.The only relief I've found was lying down tough sometimes I had moment where my back was blockedstiffed but just for a short time and after I moved a bit taking walks outside in the fresh air being distracted doing some stretching of the muscle where I have the pain. Yet what I hate is they all return. I've did the classic health anxiety attack routine going to many Doctors ER etc dozens of Bloodtest came fine have a slight Arthrosis and disc misplacement on my neck nothing seriously according to the doctors Neurologe didn't found any anomaly Cardio doctor in AugustSeptember 2022 told me my heart is totally fine we did a stress test on a bike So in the end I really hope it's just my anxietyburnout as my doctors all say who gave me all these physical symptoms. All I want is that these pains finally stop! And if I did write many confusing things please tell me so I can clear it up. P.S. I wanted to add as well that I grew up with stress my whole life ever since my childhood and that even to this day I am really nervous and my fingers are always tremble I am now asking myself if my body decided to crack when I got into my 30s,Anxiety

34456,34471,Those of you that Beat Cardiophobia I Could use your Help... HelloLittle bit of background. My younger brother has a weird heart issue. He needed a pacemakerICD at 21. Nobody else in my family has it I've looked into it. I spent a whole summer getting second and third opinions from specialists in the field. I had 24 hr holter over the summer excercise test and several EKGs. This kicked off my intense fear.During the late fall I started developing weird dizziness. I went to the ER twice back to the cardiologist everyone deemed it panic. I want to believe them. I'm trying.The worst thing I've been doing is regularly checking my pulse and it's always changing. The doctors don't seem to worried though. When I'm relaxed or even just sitting and anxious it can be 60. Sometimes it's 107. The more I focus on it the more it fluctuates. I tried deleting the Samsung health app with the pulse ox but the curiosity always gets the better of me. I felt tired and panicky at work I had a little coffee and was surprised that my pulse was 66. Usually it's high when I'm stressed and have caffeine. I made a doctor's appointment and by the time I got there my pulse was 100. I showed him on the app that in the 5 minutes waiting for him to come in after the nurse took my vitals my pulse was all over the place. 65 84 100 76... He said that was normal.I just want to be free of this. I want to stop checking and freaking out. If it's high I get scared if it's low I get scared. The holter monitor averaged my hr at 66. When I'm take it it seems more like the 70s. I'm seeing a therapist but the hardest part for me it's believing I'm ok and stopping the hypervigilance and checking my pulse all the time.,Anxiety

34805,34812,I think my HA is back I was doing well with my HA for the past year.From my post history you can see I had a small episode in December I had a loss of feeling in my foot that lasted almost all month but I managed to stay chill my friends freaked out more than I did and that made me question if I am too chill but overall I had no panic attacks or sleepless nights or anything. I went to a doctor after it lasted over 10 days and was sure it's just my back. I was prescribed some medicine for two weeks and got better can feel my leg again. My doctor did schedule MRI for my back just to check why it happened and since I have a sedentary job and have had minor back pain here and there I was happy with that. MRI is next week. Now this will get graphic. What is freaking me out right now is my bowel movements. I noticed that my BMs are a bit weird in August I would get more constipated from time to time feeling an incomplete evacuation from time to time and I started to need to go more frequent sometimes up to 45 times per day usually I'd go 12 times per day. Since I was on my let's beat HA kick I wrote it off to probably not eating as well as I should or maybe it's stress. I had no pain or other issues and I had good BMs as well. Those symptoms did not go away I got used to needing to go more often got used to mild constipation mixed with occasional diarrhea but a month ago I noticed that I often would feel like I need to go but all that would come out would be a few thin pieces. And 1015 minutes later I would feel like I need to go again. Then every 34 days I will get one somewhat bigger normalish BM and would feel better empty for one day then the cycle starts again. So for the last few months and especially last month I've had the following symptoms Change in the character or frequency of bowel movements Thin ribbonlike stools A sensation of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement almost all the time now persistent urge to have a bowel movement also almost all the time Feeling back pain could be unrelated but it is low back pain Lately lots of mucus Lots of gas Occasional rectal pain Very occasional blood maybe once per two weeks or lessMy diet hasn't changed I eat plenty of fiber I don't eat meat or dairy. I know that as a 29yearold I should not be worried about colon cancer. I know my HA probably has made it something it's not. But I think what is freaking me out is not having a positive story for this. Like for my leg I could tell myself it might be sciatic nerve chill when my chest hurts I know it's probably GERD etc. But I don't have a nonthreatening explanation for these symptoms so I can feel my HA levels rising. Part of me is still clinging to this might be something else you're fine but part of is you know what these symptoms mean don't you. I know that these symptoms are enough to go to a doctor especially based on how long they have been there. Actually I might have been stupid by not going to a doctor sooner. But I already have back MRI scheduled and I've been through so many bouts of HA I know that as soon as my doctor will say something like let's get a colonoscopy I won't be able to sleep or eat at all. I don't really know what's the point of this post since nobody can tell me what's wrong or what this could be we're not doctors here and I should talk to mine. I guess I just needed to let it all out and know I am not alone and it fucking sucks to get HA back after a year of normal living. ampx200B,Anxiety

51651,51926,Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. I'm always worrying about the future past things I can't change things I say or do after im with people how people view me if I have a too much gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it that I'll always be alone etc.It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. Money is always a bug stress factor for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me I'll stick to my same safe routine and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily.

51657,51932,Im Afraid My Mom Might Hurt Me So the preface Im someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dads door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills taxes or myself that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they cant stop themselves but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene my mom did physically attack me I didnt get hurt I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me.Last night she called me to ask if I could knock on my dads door since he wasnt responding to her calls because she needed to pay a bill. I knew that this wasnt just about a bill so I compromised and sent him a text instead I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasnt going to call himwake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency as I would consider it to be rude to do so. She then says dont worry your little head about go back to sleep or whatever okay? Then she called me again this time saying What are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door. I declined saying I dont want to be a part of whatever was going on between them and she should talk to him about this to which she said I know. Hes your loving dad and Im the evil mom. I said goodnight to her she laughs and responded with not goodnight. Good bye. I say that I will talk to her tomorrow and she replies Ill never talk to you again. Not tomorrow not the next day or the next.She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. She calls me one more time that night here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door againI ask you to do one simple thing and you didnt do it. Its just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad and he isnt answering me. Its not like youre picking sides or anything! Translation Look at what I do for you! And yet you cant this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!Its not like youre picking sides or anything!Youre full of shit just like him my dad.Where has your dad been all of your life?You need to take responsibility.Is this what one of your councilors told you to say the one that I pay x amount of money I dont exactly remember.You dont even know what is going on.But fine. You can do whatever go to sleep wake up in the morning do whatever you do.Me ok. Goodnight mom.And finally I said goodnight to her and she said Dont call me mom. Just say good night.Thats not to say my dads innocent either or anything hes hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically theyre both each others abusers and victims if that makes any sense at all. But I do believe he is the safer parent as although he can at his worst make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him as he is kind of an asshole at times I dont feel like my safety is threatened around him unlike with my mom. Hes a lesser of two evils if you will.So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad and my mom immediately associated me with him. So now Im afraid that when she comes home she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad or worse. Im afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically. Okay that is all I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading this.,Anxiety
35039,35043,Head pain!!!!!! Someone please help..... For the past three weeks I have been experiencing the strangest head pains ever. Shooting pains around my head that move around and are different each time sometimes its the same spotnot always A lot of it occurs behind my ears as well. The head pain is debilitating when it comes on feels like im being stabbed in the head but at the same time is kind of dull Its a pulsating feeling and doesnt normally last that long. This is happening every single day No exaggeration and has sometimes been accompanied by a dull normal headache. I went to the ER they took a regular CT and said it was normal. The head pain will come suddenly last a few minutes and then most of the time go however one night i had a pulsating dull stabbing pain for about an hour....I took a Tylenol and It eventually went away until about 9 hours later when the aching pain returned. I havent ever experienced headaches or pain like this.. and its every day for weeks now...I am also getting weird sensations all around my head like burning pains and hotcold pains aswell. I do have health anxiety and have experienced shooting like pains in my head from panic attacks however this is not the same thing. These are real headaches unfortunately...because of these symptoms though I have convinced and self diagnosed myself with a brain aneurysm thats about to rupture at any given moment. this is the worst part. I have no history of brain aneurysms in my bloodline but somehow have convinced myself I have one. I know I had a normal CT and that reassured me a bit but then i read somewhere they arent always caught and you need to have a CT with dye to catch them. cue the anxiety again I just want to know what these types of pains can come from? I dont understand.....any ideas? and any ideas on how to cop with thishas anyone else ever been afraid of this? ugh. It sends me into a full blown panic attack when i get this headache now which basically means im anxious all day everyday.

34999,35003,Psyching myself out over hereditary cancer So this last Summer my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that has since gotten way worse. When she was diagnosed and they were testing her they found out that she a gene that can cause it and that gene can be passed down to my brother and I. I dont even know the exact details of it but Ive read stuff about how with hereditary colon cancer you have anywhere from a 5080 chance of developing it anytime before youre 50. That obviously scares the absolute shit out of me. They said even with a healthy diet and exercise you still have a chance of getting it before 50. You can only do so much to control it basically. I went to see one doctor for something unrelated and she told me I needed to get screened at age 32 Im 22 but Im scared Ill get it before then and itll be too late. My mother didnt realize she had it for over a year and when she finally had symptoms she was already stage 4. Idk Im freaking myself the hell out because Ive battled intense health anxiety all my life and whats happening to my mother and what Ive learned from it is triggering the fuck out of me. It doesnt help that Im extremely picky and find it harder than most to eat healthy and the only exercise I get is walking and light lifting at work. ,Anxiety

34696,34704,21MFIRST TIME HERE THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP GIVEN TO ME. Hi guys never posted here before however I am in a very dark place right now with my life and don't really know how to start this but for a while now I have felt very low and have felt as if I am becoming a different person as I no longer find happiness in myself as I did before I am a university student also working in retail as well as recently being signed to a modelling agency and I often feel as if I have to put a happy face on everyday and I am honestly tired of having to do this it is physically as well as mentally draining. This feeling came around I would say at least a year ago and I kind of thought that it would pass as everyone does go through periods in their life were they feel low however it seems to have stayed and feels like a black cloud hanging over me which feels worse some days more then others I come from a very loving family and live with my Mother and Stepfather as well as my younger 3 half siblings I am very grateful for the luxuries I have in my life however there is so much going on within me some days I often wake up feeling very down for no reason at all feeling very worthless and lonely even though my family are very supportive and caring I couldn't ask for a better family. ampx200BI believe my mental health has worsened due to finding out through family members that my biological father has been diagnosed with cancer and I guess this has made me realise that life really is so short and for some reason it has caused me to question myself asking I wonder if this is cancer causing? or what if I also get cancer one day? almost as if I have some sort of health anxiety and this is becoming an everyday moment as a youngster my biological father was unable to be there for me and my mother due to his lack of love or care and the biggest blessing was my mother marrying again to a man who I can happily refer to as a real father also a very close family member to me who I once spent a lot of time with has recently tried numerous times to take their own life and being so distant from them for so long has not been a good feeling and has made me feel quite lonely as I am already an individual who does not really have true friends as I struggle to trust people there have been many times were I have been invited out by others and have had to make up excuses for reasons not to go. There have been times were I have contemplated taking my own life as the feeling of worthlessness and sadness was at its most high this feeling is very hard to explain and I am just looking for a bit of clarity on maybe why I am feeling this way or if others have experienced something similar I really would appreciate any help at all.To individuals at work and university and others I meet I am often commented on being a very outgoing individual with a lot of confidence however deep down I often feel as if inside I am a totally different person which really does make me wonder how I became to be like this. I feel as if I lack the routine I once had in my life before and some days waking up feels as if I am just going through the motions not long ago I would read everyday and would love to keep a journal to put my thoughts to paper I remember heading to the gym 5 times a week running twice a week being full of energy living life to the fullest appreciating each day with those around me where has the old me gone?. Often I have been told by others I am a very goodlooking individual and in playful ways people have said You love yourself don't you or you are so cocky as I very much take pride in my physical appearance and enjoy doing my best to look as good as I can the truth is recently I have been struggling everyday to keep a positive mindset and do the things I enjoy having to put a mask on everyday is a task which I have become very familiar with I just want to know if others have felt the same and I would really appreciate any help which can be given I don't want to give up I don't want to carry on feeling this way I want the suffering to end or at least made easier. ampx200BThank you for taking the time to read this I apologise for any grammatical mistakes it is quite late in the night right now. ,Anxiety
34772,34780,Rabies fear Hello everyone back again this time with a rabies scare.I got a new cat about 3 months ago and she's a community stray from kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia. She's about 9 months old now and very rambunctious and quite a cutie.However as she is rambunctious I somehow started looking into whether or not she could have rabies. She runs around like crazy rolls around a lot and loves biting me. Like LOVES biting me. Definitely drawn blood a few times no infections due to careful cleaning after. I read that rabies usually shows 23 months after infection and upwards of a year so theoretically if she was bitten before I got her she's 100 an indoor cat now she could start showing symptoms. Is it at all possible or am I being a doof?Also should mention got her all of her shots after taking her in. Not sure if that matters for rabies.Thank you all!,Anxiety

51941,52222,Anxiety about my appearance separates my life in two sides Hello! Today I 18M fully realized that I cannot function properly as a human being unless I'm directly seeking acceptance in others. This translates to me not showering not brushing my teeth not shaving not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that I am clean and normal. I recently started college I've been making friends and generally having a great time this if u look at it from the outside. Inside my head I just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically because of my clothes my face my hair because I have a gray shadow even after just 30 minutes of shaving because somehow I smell bad etc. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads And don't let me start with my personality basically all this converts into me having a sort of Double life.When I need to go outside I do all the work I can possibly do to try and look nice smell good and be a nice person. But the moment I'm in my home my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side I don't take care of myself in any way type or form suddenly I am mean lazy antisocial and want to die once again. The cycle repeats day after day I've been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now but my body just doesn't respond every fiber of my mind tells me that I can't do anything right I will always be kinda ugly kinda fat and kinda gross so why bother trying?Maybe nothing of this makes any sense sorry english is not my first language and i'm just trying to cope somehow,Anxiety

After eating when to floss and pick it out and digged around for a while. I think I got the piece out but my gums were bleeding a good amount. Note I do have healthy teeth and go to the dentist every year. On Saturday afternoon that tooth and jaw area had a dull pain made me stay in the night as it was just annoying. Today woke up and for the first hour seemed alright but that dull pain is now back. The thing is I am in the army and we are going to the field woods for training these next two weeks.

35155,35156,Diabetics Ketoacidosis and Brain Cancer Hi I'm new here. I started having very mild health anxiety when I was younger but it recently increased the last few months. In December I went to the ER due to chest pains because I was sure I was having a heart attack even though I was terrified. I went to the doctor and they said it was just acid reflux and they sent me home with a prescription. After that I had to followup with my PCP and she told me there was an abnormality in my EKG my second one and referred me to a cardiologist to do an echocardiogram. That same week I was worrying about every little ache and symptom that I've read about heart attacks and kept manifesting each one. It sucked because I didn't feel like it was all in my head and I kept freaking out. Mind you I'm a college student away from home which made everything worse. Winter break came and I went home. I didn't feel any symptoms and I wasn't worried about my health anymore. Then I came back to school last month and my friend had a stroke. She's 19 so I was surprised at how young she was to be having a stroke. This event stirred up my past anxieties about my heart and I found myself checking my heart rate often throughout my day again. I would also google every possible heart condition that I could have that I wouldn't know of. The next week I finally got my echocardiogram done and the doctor said it was completely normal which eased my mind at little bit. That same week I had on and off nausea which I was sure was because of how anxious I was about my health. The next few days go by and I start having tension headaches or so I think. They were on and off as well but it just hurt to the point where I was convinced I had brain cancer. With the nausea and the headaches I just assumed. I tried to refrain from googling the symptoms because I knew it would elevate my worries but I couldn't resist. The last few days I've been so worried about having brain cancer because I wouldn't be able to focus and some things were hard to remember but there is no family history of any type of cancer so I kept trying to focus on that. Now I am currently worrying that I have Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I have no family history of diabetes and I've never been told that I should watch out for it because I am 18 normal weight and have been healthy. But lately I've been stress eating because of how anxious I've been and food makes me feel a little better. However I always feel guilty right after eating and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I just don't know how to cope with this anymore and I have a doctor's appointment next week so hopefully she can ease my mind a bit more. ,Anxiety
35673,35668,How to help my husband Hi there! I am a 28 YO F married to my incredible 37 YO M husband who suffers from health anxiety. It comes in waves. He has gone through some therapy but she wasnt a LMHC so it was kind of pointless. He is on a low dose SSRI and that usually helps. Until we see someone who has MS. Oddly enough my maternal grandmother had MS. He does not have any history of it in his family. He does not know his paternal grandfather and sometimes that is his excuse for why he thinks MS might run in his family. Anyway we saw a friend who was recently diagnosed with MS over the weekend and his anxiety has been through the roof. I have severe anxiety and OCD so sometimes I spiral once hes spiraling but usually I can keep my cool. I am trying to find a way to help him. He has no real symptoms but has some issues that lead to similar symptoms. For example hes a graphic design teacher with metal screws in his wrist so he frequently gets odd sensations in his hands from working on computers all day but of course thats the MS not the likely carpal tunnel or arthritis he has going on. Any suggestions? He is open to therapy but I dont know that he will stick to it since the episodes are so few and far between. What can I do to help?,Anxiety
34179,34198,Skin on back and arms feels like it's burning? Hello all. I'm new to the subreddit but I wanted to see if anyone could help put my mind at ease. For the last couple of months my mom's health has not been the best.To make things worse I've been smoking weed and it's pretty much been giving me panic attacks everyday. I stopped smoking weed a couple days ago to see if it would help. Anyways In the beginning of last week she was admitted to the hospital and among other things it really stressed me out. That Monday I woke up in the middle of the night sweating hungry and cold. I was pacing back and forth and I started googling my symptoms I know bad idea and I came across peripheral neuropathy. I googled the causes of that MS was one of the results and I started to freak out. I googled relentlessly for the next week because the burning on my back and arms has not stopped since and it's put all my senses on high alert. I also feel like cold electricity going up the back of my head I I'ven really anxious ever since and it's started to affect me. I went to the hospital and got a CT scan on my neck and they found nothing. I read online that one of the ways to diagnose MS was to do an MRI of the brain and spine to look for lesions so I'm not surprised that the CT scan came back clear. I haven't been back to the hospital but the symptoms just haven't stopped. Now I'm also getting twitches all over and my muscles feel weak but I think that's just the anxiety playing tricks on me. I went to the doctor this morning and explained to her all my symptoms. She did some basic strength tests and she told me that the burning skin can be a symptom of anxiety. I've also googled burning skin and anxiety can cause that but it still hasn't really made me feel better. I had some blood work done and she prescribed me muscle relaxers and an antidepressant and told me to come back in 3 weeks. Could all my symptoms really just be from anxiety? The burning also at times can feel like my skin is cold but when I touch it it's not. I have noticed that my symptoms do go down a bit if I calm down a bit. Anyone else experience something similar? ,Anxiety

I touched its backshoulder area to see if it was alive but it was cold to the touch. anyway I put hand sanitizer on when I got back to my car but I know hand sanitizer can't really kill viruses and after I put the sanitizer on I noticed I had a papercut on my finger that I didn't see before. on the hand I touched the dead cat with! is it possible there was rabies virus on the cat's fur like maybe invisible blood that I couldn't see?? ,Anxiety

34322,34339,Fear of Brain Damage My health anxiety has completely debilitated me for the past four months due to worry that I damaged my brain from drinking for years. I constantly test my memory and feel it is declining rapidly. I have trouble picturing things from seconds ago in my mind all my memories no matter how distant or recent feel insanely foggy time is flying by as I feel Im not forming new memories and I often cant remember if I did something today or the day before even if it was just a few hours ago. Scarier symptoms involve me feeling confused and unfamiliar with my own family house dog etc. and feeling like I have to remind myself where I am or where Im going. I have brief moments of confusion where I have to piece everything together and constant memories that have nothing to do with what Im doing which lead me to a fear of seizures that I ended up being tested for that have happened for he past few years when I was super anxious. I have had an MRI CT PET 3 day eeg and neuropsych testing and everything came back good but I cant believe my symptoms are just anxiety and derealization since it feels its progressively getting worse over the past few months which I barely have any memories of. I honestly feel I have severe short term memory loss and have posited thy maybe I was having seizures and brain damage from alcohol but the neurologist psychiatrist GP neuropsych and therapists all dont think so.I have in the past believed I had HIV liver failure mouth cancer throat cancer and other ailments and of course they all ended up being false but this one feels so much more real. Has anyone else ever had extreme memory issues just because of anxiety?,Anxiety
52141,52433,A lot of anxiety over this so I need advice please. The following is a text I really wanna send this girl in my class. I like her a lot she is really pretty I have no idea how she feels about me but the past two girls Ive been talking to I never was really upfront about how I felt in the slightest and they both have found their own relationships and it really made me angry with myself for not being honest. Granted Im not actually saying I like her in the text or anything but I feel it would be implied lol. But any advice would help. We send each other homework and help each other in class but thats it. She is really awesome.I really dont mean for this to be awkward lol but it probably is anyway. I was trying to tell you in class yesterday without everyone hearing and turning around but I thought you looked really beautiful and I just chickened out and didnt say it for some stupid reason. But its been eating at me because Id rather feel like an idiot who made someone feel good about themselves than an idiot who didnt . Really trying not to be weird Im just trying to get better with this stuff and saying how I feel. But I recognize I probably made it weird.,Anxiety
35552,35547,There is always light at the other end of the tunnel! Just a little backstory I have had hypochondria that has steadily i creased in terms of severity since late last November. Over this period of time I have been worried about going deaf having heart diseasedying of a heart attack going blind having the Hantavirus having lung cancer and the most recent one skin cancer. Throughout all of my fictional illnesses even with the consideration of how rare they are to my specific case I continued to believe I had them. I mean heck I live in Australia and there are only 15 cases a year of the HantaVirus out of the whole country. Didnt matter. My brain knew I would be in that 0.00000062 chance of getting it. Although of this considerably unrealistic thinking I still believe that deep down I knew I did not have the virus. Enter Skin Cancer. Out of all of my fears this one really stood out to me. I had an oh shit moment where I realised my petty fears before where nothing compared to this beast. Due to the fact I am a relatively avid golfer who plays without sunscreen and typically without a hat this fear was so real to me. Book the doctors in a 16 day wait I shit you not. In the beginning of this wait I was fine because my worries were on other things. However approaching the date I developed absolute chaos inside of my head. I head to google and establish... Yep... must be Stage 4 skin cancer this is the end. For the week I could not attend school maintaining the fear there was a long road of chemotherapy doctors appointments and eventually death ahead of me. Today I finally go in to the get the skin check. I was essentially prepared to have my life torn to shreds if I needed to get a biopsy and then to wait for the results of said biopsy. Doc looks at practically every mole on my body nothing. No stage 4 cancer. No risk of death. Just nothing. Although other worries have taken the limelight of the skin cancer I maintain a sense of happiness and humour about how much I work myself up. How much I google every single one of my bloody symptoms. Not just I however we all do. This story was to simply let people know that there always light at the other end of the tunnel and I cannot say it enough stop googling your symptoms. If you are really worried about something get it checked up with your doctor ASAP and put your concerns put to rest by the professional! ,Anxiety
34274,34291,I'm 16 and going through hell. My anxiety exists due to my high heart rate and I have some questions. I've been dealing with this crap for almost 3 years. It all started with a bad infection that almost costed me a finger. Since then I've thought I had cancer autoimmune diseases genetic disorders neurological disorders diabetes severe mental issues beyond anxiety and a whole bunch of crap. Luckily I saw how ridiculous this was before it got too severe hehe it probably is but not as much as it could possibly get. Now my problem is my heart. I know it is supposed to speed up when having stress anxiety or panic I know why my fingers tingle I know why I hyperventilate and how it makes things worse I know why I get headaches I know! My issue is that it speeds up in a way that I think is too fast. For example during anxious moments my heart rate is around 100120 normal and I understand. During panic attacks my heart rate is about 180205 not normal. My question is if anyone relates to this? The funny not really funny thing about anxiety is that the symptoms cycle. Anxiety is a smart cookie who knows how to fool you pretty bad. I've been writing down EVERYTHING since this started and I've learned a lot about how it works. I've solved my past diseases by finding the flaw in my thinking process but this time I can't. I can count my heart rate when it is that fast. I believe heart anxiety is one of the most difficult ones to beat because the heart does some weird things that we're not supposed to feel but anxiety allows you to. I get ectopic beats My heart stops for a few seconds and then beats strongly again which I know are normal but I feel them and people are not supposed to feel them. It's all due to my anxiety. Anyway I'll repeat my question again Does anyone else gets heart rate of 180 to 205 BPM during panic attacks? ,Anxiety
52655,52964,Why can't I believe what the doctors tell me? I 26 M am super frustrated with myself today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux. The cardiologist did some blood pressurepulse checks to rule out POTS and said I was fine on that front. The EKG came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape. I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something. My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.Edit I should note I am very aware that I have health anxiety and I am currently in therapy for it already It still bugs me though.,Anxiety
585,587,Looking for a job and the prospect of becoming unemployed makes me nervous ,Anxiety
51798,52078,Can someone relate to this or have I broken myself? I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore and it's a vicious cycle. And so please telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.Recently I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.After a recent night out I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with im new to the job. There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.However I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rapehurtabuse someone or that I was racist towards someone or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughingtalking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen so much that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.This is not a new thing in my life I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me. The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.,Anxiety

35008,35012,Chest pains and limb numbness Cardiac ischemia possible for F24? I'm female 24 years old and I've been chronically experiencing most of the symptoms describing cardiac ischemia. For a few years but more often lately. I have no issue of being overweight rather almost underweight and generally I don't seem like the type who'd have heart problems. I rarely smoke don't drink. But I do go through a lot of emotional stress am very depressed and I don't move enough spending a lot of time at home in bed. When I'm depressed I often wake up full of anxiety feeling like I'm almost having a heart attack.I know that I should probably do an ECG asap to know for sure but I will only be able to do it in a couple of months.

34694,34702,It's officially affecting my every day life The anxiety meds aren't responding. I got finished with an eye doctor appointment who told me my eyes were fine the initial cause of this got one night of rest after 3 weeks of anxious manic hell and it started up the next day. It moved from my eyes to other health concerns. It just never stops. I've talked to my therapist but I don't know when I'll see my psychiatrist next. I'm losing sleep. I'm barely hanging in there. I'm being a good girl and staying away from google but still continuously performing body checks every few hours and obsessing over random sensations and tingles on my body. Sleeping is the worst. I can't at all. I toss and turn. Wake up from panic attacks. Have vivid nightmares. It's just all gone to hell after years of building up and I don't know what to do. I've attempted grounding meditation nature sounds reassuring myself etc etc. It builds back up.I'm not sure where to go next or what to do. Maybe more doctor appointments if it even helps anymore. Sometimes I think they're lying to me. Sometimes my brain tells me they either missed something or just aren't trained enough. I'm just crying right now because I feel so defeated. My brain has collapsed into itself and I can't escape it anymore.,Anxiety
35570,35565,Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support. This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.I started off as a mess and eventually got a full heartbody checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains numbness tingling in my limbs dizzy spells being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke and a ton of other shit something outside my control changed my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself stressed but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis inflammation of the rib tissues read stressinduced I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and selfadjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough I am. Also my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf I know stick with me and it's been lifechanging. Yes this is obvious. Yes we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just how much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!So to recap here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impactGet a doctor's opinion. As in a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job but if something is stressing you out a situation at work a significant other family take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fightorflight response. You absolutely do not to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people like me apparently.For the love of Reddit never Google your symptoms.The terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.,Anxiety

34368,34384,Convinced I'm dying from visiting auto body shop Hi everyoneSo basically Im freaking out because Im thinking about how I used to visit my estranged dads body shop from time to time growing up during the summer. I cant imagine that I would have gone more than 1015 times or so in a given summer and some years I probably only went a couple of times others none at all.I would go to work with him to washvacuum cars answer the phone and sometimes wetsand cars. However there would be times where I would follow him around to his back shop to check on his employees. Or I would go back there to let him know that a customer was waiting for him. Im currently freaking out bc I cant imagine that being in that environment while guys were doing work could have been good for me even though I wasnt doing any sanding or painting myself. His back shop is rather large and he would keep his garage doors open for ventilation httpsimgur.comFviJwNq see building on the left. I think I remember a couple of times in the winter I was there and he had the doors shut though. I probably opened the door to the paint booth a handful of times to scream in there that someone was waiting for him.My biggest fear is that Ill wind up getting cancer or something years down the line from now. I probably first went to his shop when I was 5 and stopping visiting after I was 18 or 19. I have no idea how secondhand exposure to this stuff works. Does this limited secondhand exposure to dustpaint as a kid pretty much guarantee problems down the road? Or does that typically require years of direct exposure?Was my dad 100 in the wrong for letting me come to work with him in the first place? Part of me thinks that its quite common for kids to go their familyowned businesses but still.Its gotten to the point where these thoughts dominate my mind and its very difficult to care about anything since I feel like Im dead anyway.I think its entirely possible that Im overreacting and this anxiety is brought on by the fact that I just graduated college and started my first job.Can someone please let me know what they think?Edit I found some pictures of his shop so that you can see what the environment was like for what its worth httpswww.facebook.compgSuddenImpactAutobodyINC161287353937984photos?refpageinternal,Anxiety
52662,52971,Anxiety and Weed Hi looking for a bit of advice and experiences from ranxiety here.Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed but not excessively mostly once a week. After developing said disorder weed now increases my symptoms despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout I mainly suffered physical symptoms. In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results sometimes I get more anxious and panicky but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse depending on the day so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest I quit enjoyed being high so that would be quite the bummer but certainly not the end of the world.Thanks in advance!,Anxiety

34200,34219,Loss of appetite for over a month I believe I got the flu right on Christmas Day most likely caused by eating extremely spicy popcorn which I have been eating somewhat frequently prior. Went to the ER about 4 days after and got nothing but laughs from the doctor saying there's nothing wrong. Been eating nothing but rice porridge and shredded pork for over a week. I could hold food down but have completely lost the urge to eat since would occasionally eat out to try and care for my hunger pangs that I think I was having. At first it was difficult to eat or even will myself to eat got better then got worse again. At this point I could hardly eat and have to seriously think about whether or not I am hungry since it's seemingly impossible to tell when it was as easy as a stomach growl before then. 56 days ago I think I got food poisoning now I absolutely can't eat anything. Got the flu shot maybe 2 days prior and things only seemed to get worse then. Would often puke but wouldn't see food come back out mostly what looked like saliva had nothing but rice porridge after all. Went to the doctor's office and was prescribed Ranitidine the medication may have cause this sense of looming nervousness but it's most likely just me since I've been fine with it every other time after about the second day of taking it or so. Decided that it was now necessary to force feed myself to jumpstart my appetite along with light walking 12 miles after each meal or so I wasn't physically active at all prior worse since I was bedridden during the flu. I fear that I'm overeating when I've been told to eat 56 small meals each day I've also grown terribly impatient with my recovery seeing as how this has been going on for over a month. I would often feel incredibly miserable and every day I was plagued with anxiety until I decided to force feed myself I don't care about getting fat anymore I just want my appetite back but now I'm starting to fear that I'm going about this the wrong way. The feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have hardly gotten better and while I don't suspect my loss of appetite is due to my anxiety I can never be too sure. The whole reason why I even had anxiety in the first place was because of how sudden my loss of appetite was and how I was unable to self diagnose myself since I felt no abdominal pain whatsoever I'm at a loss as to what's going on with my body. ,Anxiety

33935,33955,I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old male and im 6' 3 170 lbsLet me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.Two years later this last summer i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painfultender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds in muscle over the last 6 months.What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.Also i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years,Anxiety

I feel like I dont connect with anyone and everyone gets along with each other then everybody thinks Im a weirdo because Im quiet. I hate being like this Is this anxiety or am I just overreacting. I dont want to give much more details but I really struggle to talk to people unless they make the first move. It feels like Im a total outcast even teachers dont want to talk to me. I dont know what Im doing wrong I wouldnt say Im ugly or weird besides being quiet. What do I do and how do I stop being so anxious when saying even the smallest thing to another person. I big myself up everyday and then I come home having done nothing different. I just got back to school after a long break since I had surgery and Ive been feeling more depressed when coming home from school ever since.,Anxiety

I have another smaller one on my head and the same spot in my neck on the left. I get really obsessive when it even gets a little bigger like it is now because Ive been having some throat normal winter stuff going on. I told my therapist a long time ago and they never got bigger I never had symptoms but they showed up years ago when I had a bad cold. Also I think theyd show up from physicals that Ive had over the years? Since I had blood work done etc. I just read some post where a girl had lymphoma that they didnt even catch from a biopsy and my heart literally dropped it scared me that much. But she also had more nodes showing up. This stuff scares me so much and I cant talk to friends about it because they just dont understand.

46615,46607,needing validation ive never posted on this subreddit before because i am not officially diagnosed bipolar but i went from MDD to an unspecified mood disorder in less than a year. some bg im a college sophomore. the first time i ever went to therapy was march of last year. i started lamictal in december. growing up mental illness was just not a thing to my parents so i never saw any doctor or pdoc.basically ive had to do and learn everything myself regarding mental illness and treatment. but i think im reaching a burnout. the lamictal is great however my focus issues which ill just address as ADHD i have vivid memories of almost never sleeping during preschool nap time and instead lifting up our bed mats with my legs and ive heard my mom say she has it are still something i don't have treatment for.not being diagnosed with anything as a kid has made this journey incredibly difficult especially concering ADHD. while ive improved drastically since freshman year i had a debilitating depressive episode where i ended up with a 0.8 GPA i haven't made progress with the ADHD. last friday i went to an ADHD screening for testing at my school's psych services office as im required to have the school's insurance anyways. it was the most discouraging experience.i told the woman that ive had focus issues and homework issues for as long as i can remember. i told her exactly what my thoughts would be like in a class my horrible sleep quality my difficulties around getting my work done etc. i talked to her about the very recent development regarding my mood disorder.she told me that she thinks what i was describing is related to other issues which were out of their scope and recommended me to a doctor who has a semester long waitlist for full psychological testing. which would be at least 400 4000 if i didnt have insurance. last semester i dealt with ADHD by meeting with a professor every week to go over assignments. i got accommodations from a few classes even without being registered with disability services. however that's not 100 the case with all my classes this semester. i was struggling before that screening but now im struggling even more. i have a test tomorrow morning i have not studied for not to mention i did not do at all an essay assignment and i havent done the workbook pages due by the test. i had to ask for an extension for a paper in another class the night before because i hadn't even written it. ive missed meetings and work.that friday night i tried to find coke. sunday night i took 5 shots at 1am. monday i bought adderall and took 34 of it and ive never taken adderall before. i have not done anything but stay in bed because the thought of even trying to tackle my immense amount of work is so overwhelming. i know it takes a while to get a diagnosis but like i said i am feeling so burnt out. how many more doctors do i have to see? how many more episodes do i have to go through and other selfdestructive behaviour? my family is no help either my father threatened to not pay my tuition when he found out i was taking meds and refused to tell him. the rest are just invalidating. i don't know what to do or figure out what i need to find out. i am so tired of not having anything. my chest literally hurts and im curled up in bed in the dark crying. im sorry this is so long but ive never had the chance or resource to really talk about this stuff honestly that im just letting it all out now. im just desperate for some reassurance and validation at the very least.,Bipolar

45850,45844,Waiting to get into a doctor I moved to Florida about a year ago and I had a lapse in insurance coverage.

I ran out of these meds about 8 months ago but Ive been managing pretty well lately until this past week. Ive been working a full time job and I deal with stressful people day in and day out. It usually doesnt get to me but I havent been able to get in to see a doctor and I feel so frustrated. Ive had some really bad lows and some mild highs but I feel myself dipping down really low again and Im worried Im going to fuck everything up. On top of having bipolar I also have ptsd and anxiety. Depending on how my bipolar is being treated these things kind of make one or the other worse at times. Im just really frustrated and Ive worked really hard to get to where I am and I dont know how to keep control of everything when I cant even get a doctors office to call me back and schedule me.

46525,46518,Advice on longterm treatment for a bipolar depressed family member? My brother has had bipolar depression since he was a teenager he's mid20s now and still living with our retired father. Recently he attempted suicide by jumping off a 15foot balcony and breaking his feet leading to hospitalization and inpatient psych. Given the background context below what would you do? He has talked about and threatened suicide hundreds of times This is the third time he's been hospitalized in the last 90 days previously for psychosis and suicidal threats Each time he's released after 35 days after he begins to act normal and wants to go home Our father is a psychiatrist who desperately wants to help him and has not been willing to kick him out of the house He has not been willing to consider longerterm inpatient psychiatric options I don't know what options are available? and because he always has had my father's home to return to the hospital is always able to discharge him He has seen at least 20 psychiatrists in the last decade and taken hundreds of different medications with zero success He has received a year of ECT treatment with significant memory loss and only temporary depression relief He dropped out of high school due to a combination of social phobia depression sensory issues and rage issues He has never applied for a job He sometimes wishes to move into his own apartment but that gets derailed by his constant suicidal threats changing his mind about everything easily becoming frustrated and overwhelmed and at least for now he can't even walk...How do you end a revolving door of 5day long emergency room and inpatient psychiatric visits? Is my father's home being open to him actually hurting his chances of recovery? Would being barred from returning home force him to choose between homelessness and longterm inpatient care? My father is in his 60s and beginning to decline mentally so I see this situation deteriorating longterm if someone doesn't do something. What would you do?,Bipolar

Someone whose opinion I care about told me recently that he thinks I should go see someone and get medicated . It started kind of a big fight and at the time I was really angry because I didnt think he understood what was going on . I took some of the meds they would probably start me on when I was a teenager because of these seizures I was having and I told him I would literally rather die than take them again and feel the way they made me feel again . I hated being in a fog all the time not feeling anything at all ever the weird side effects . He tried telling me that I could tell them that and that it didnt have to be like that again but all I heard was youre being over dramatic and crazy . Which isnt really fair to him . Ive never been professionally diagnosed with anything ever but theres always been something not right . Its gotten worse the last few years more and more intense to the pint I dont even believe myself when I say I can handle it myself . I guess if Im being honest Im fucking terrified to even think about getting diagnosed and getting on meds . Im terrified of not being me anymore because even when I feel awful and like Im drowning in darkness I know that Im gonna get this high again and be ok . Im scared of getting told Im crazy .

45432,45428,I'm on klonopin but it doesn't seem to be very effective anymore... The background which can be skipped if you'd likeI've been on benzos for about 16 years. At one point when I was 2021 I was put on on Xanax 6mgday which is obscene. I think this increased my tolerance. At the time I was also very depressed maybe exasperated by the Xanax and drinking a liter of vodka a day.Needless to say after a bit of homelessness and finally moving to a different state I was slowly tapered down on Valium. I was relatively stable in that and then was forced to move again to another state where they refused to prescribe any benzos or any adequate medications for my bipolar disorder.I ended up staying in the house for about nine months because I was too anxious to leave. I would go to my psych appointments with no progress on getting them to put me on something that worked for the intense depression I was in. I was seeing a psychiatrist at the time who I really connected with and miss him but have never found another one who I don't feel is judging my life.I quit drinking cold turkey 5 years ago and have never had any more problems with that.However I was then forced to move to yet another state where I couldn't find any psychiatric treatment whatsoever as was unmediated and in a mixed episode for over a year. I did finally get into psychiatric treatment by going inpatient and was put back on klonopin 3mgday which I'm told is a high dose.Then my psychiatrist suddenly died and his clinic closed. Two months later I got an appointment with my wonderful new psychiatrist and was back on track. Unfortunately the klonopin doesn't seem to have much effect on me. I've taken 10mg at once with absolutely no effect I'm aware this is dangerous as fuck but apparently not for me.To the current situationI am looking for a change. My anxiety level is very high but vaping with nicotine I have never been an actual cigarette smoker seems to help quite a bit but not entirely. With the Klonopin not doing its job I feel like a different benzo might be a potential answer. I don't want to be back on Xanax and Valium didn't do much either. Has anyone been in a similar situation with tolerance and successfully switched to a more effective benzo? If so any suggestions?,Bipolar

I was diagnosed with Bipolar type II about a year ago and I currently have a job but am looking for a new position. While filling out my apps there is a mandatory question where they ask if you have an kind of disability and Bipolar Disorder is on the list. I'm very hesitant about identifying myself with a disability. I was able to stay on my dad's insurance with a letter from my doctor but I'm not sure what applies for this. I'm really nervous about letting any of my employers know I am Bipolar. I'm pretty good at hiding my illness but I have depressive dips that last for a few months and they affect my work. I'm on medication but currently I've been having hormonal issues that I'm dealing with my gyno. I get very antisocial and irritable but I am afraid of my work trying to get rid of me if they knew. I know they technically they're not allowed to but I work in the Biotech industry and they can be very cutthroat. I don't want to not be hired for a job if I was upfront with being bipolar. I also do value my privacy and I don't want the whole world knowing about my illness. I was hoping someone out there has been dealing with this issue and can offer some advice. Thanks guys! ,Bipolar

I called my psychiatrist and told him I just didnt think I could do this anymore told him Im not gonna be able to pull myself out of this one. So he put me on a med to work in tandem with my mood stabilizer. Ive been on it for a few weeks now and I already feel so much better. My mood my ability to cope and do better in many aspects of my life handle my husbands dark times doing things to improve the relationship itself and my anxiety is so much lower I find myself going days without having an attack.

My therapist also wants me to be tested for ADHD because of the things she's heard from me and seen in my behaviors. Valid but I'm a 28 year old so I feel like if I was ADHD I would have known it long before now. I'm wondering if anyone out there has a diagnosis of bipolar and ADHD. How do you cope? What does the combination of meds look like for you? My biggest concern is adding on an ADHD med because of the link to psychosis that's come out recently.,Bipolar
46768,46758,I honestly don't know what to do warning rant ahead and me being manic reaching out for something anything! I am trying to dumb this down as much as I can to fit a general post so here it goes... YEARS ago i disowned my friends. Swore them off like they were a plague mainly to reinforce my manic state of I wasn't good enough for them. Because seriously I am not good enough. My mood swings are prevalent my lack of funds from being manic are there my general lack of well being keeps me from hanging out so to speak. I dont know what to do. I miss them. The whole friendship arc has worn itself out and I am a side character waiting to be in the story again. So instead of that I cut things Everythings. and here I am alone and depressed years later reaching out to the interwebs to see what they have to say about my relationship issues. I want to be a part of someones life. I want to be a human again. I want a friend. I want to say sure I am ok to someone and actually mean it.

46509,46502,Evidence for high TSHlow thyroid causing rapid cycling mania? I was recently diagnosed with unipolar maniabipolar NOS after having a ton of hypomanic episodes over the past three years started out as 12 a year but over the last six months I've had at least one a month each lasting up to 10 days.I just started lithium so I had my bloodwork pulled and my TSH showed up with a result of 2.78 mIUL. My psychiatrist looked at that result and said that we need to get it below 2 and that she thought my high TSH was the reason I was rapid cycling.She wants to get me on a synthetic thyroid and I'm skeptical. 2.78 mIUL seems to be within healthy reference ranges though it is on the high side and I can't find any evidence that higher TSH values cause rapid cycling for mania. I've found evidence that taking synthetic thyroid was effective in preventing rapid cycling with people with depressionhttpspsycheducation.orgtreatmentthyroidandbipolardisorderhighdosethyroidhormoneasamoodstabilizerinbipolardisorder but it doesn't mention mania.

I know what I have to do to feel more satisfied more fulfilled but it really seems like an uphill battle.I need to lose a lot of weight that I gained because of meds and overeating due to stress trauma and fucked up hunger cues from the meds. I need to get a better paying job so I can afford to live on my own and not live paycheck to paycheck or work a part time in addition to my full time. Then I have my grander goals like grad school getting married and starting a family moving up in my career. Im just so deeply unhappy with where I currently am and how hard I have to work on top of managing my mood swings. So much so that I frequently contemplate just giving up on being alive at all. I had to put my dog to rest this week and the week leading up to it and this week Ive pretty much let my routine go. I dont shower frequently enough I dont do my skincare I dont eat well but Im still not losing weight I barely manage 2030 min of exercise which my partner so helpfully points out is not enough if Im serious about losing weight.

46358,46351,Is this me? off my chest I'm not asking legit medical advice all I'm wondering is some direction in why I am the way I am. and at the same time it's a bit of an off my chest . I've never felt quiet right but I tried to accept it as I never wanted to be categorized as someone who's mentally ill. But lately I notice I'm getting worse and the only way to describe it for me when I found the word 'Manic depression''Bipolar'. It's as if I felt understood for the first time. A lot of my time I spend alone on my room except when I go out to meet friends. So my family doesn't know much of my personality. Last summer I had a job at the same restaurant my sister works and shecoworkers noticed how I'm often staring into space while smiling and this is a big part of me. Whenever I experience this full on power high feeling as described by people during manic depression I get lost in my fantasies and I feel as if the world surrounding me no longer exist and build up whole scenario's and imagine people to be near me. For example I would imagine to be in a big house while holding a conversation with a person I want to speak with and I would laugh at their jokes as if it were their jokes. most of the time my life is amazing in these deep daydreams sometimes they could be described as another persons nightmare. I'm not even hating this. I feel a part of it is a coping mechanism which goes hand in hand with my natural creativity. And I love the force of energy I have during these moments. How I can smile as if I'm drunk just by staring and thinking about all the amazing things i can accomplish. by thinking how charming I am. And then the next second I could cry. I'm not sure if it's how I really feel sad. Or if it's an overload of happiness that makes me sad in the moment. ButI really burst of energy in which I actually do accomplish a lot. I know it's not a healthy me but it's the best version of myself if I want to get things done. I feel as if it isn't totally me but more a phase. But I love who I am during this phase. Because the other part of me is depressed and has no energy. I hate admitting to this part because while I know my life situation sucks and would had likely made anyone insane and as I have experienced horrible things and have anxiety I hate accepting that a big other side of me is useless by depression. As I feel like I'm constantly trying to fight it and these moments of feeling highhappy actually make me feel at times as if I'm on the right track. But now I read more about this subject I feel I'm not winning any battle at all when feeling high on energy is just another extreme on the spectrum. The weirdest thing I have done in these daydreams is travel to another country because I felt like i couldfinancielle it wasnt the greatest choice like it could be amazing. I fell asleep in the airplane and once I woke up i was wondering what I was doing. I don't regret it and still had an okay time for a couple of days but i do notice it isn't normal behaviour and cried one night wishing to be home again. I'm planning to upload soon a cover of me singing on the internet but i'm slightly afraid of the attention among friends I will get as it will likely impact my emotions. I'm not into getting attention as it will bring out either side of me but I never know which one. Sigh will be a rollercoaster. ,Bipolar
46873,46863,Pot induced my mania is this the new normal? Is bipolar mania precipitated by marijuana use typically one off or a new normal in the cycle? Am I likely to experience fullblown mania without medication?Some backgroundAfter a period of minor depression I reverted to old habits and smoked some marijuana which caused my first manic episode. I spent some time in a psych ward and was given lithium and zyprexa which didn't fully suppress my manic state. After a couple months in hypomania I gave my zyprexa to someone else I'd med who couldn't afford them. I thought I'd be fine with just a week until my next refill. I was wrong and went manic totalled my car and ended up back in the psych ward. Now I'm dealing with the fallout from this event.I'm 26 and generally high functioning. I was an alcoholic for a few years and have been sober for about 4 years it runs in my family. I'd smoked pot before but not often because it would make me feel very anxious and make my thoughts race.Is this extreme episode of mania my new normal or is it likely a oneoff ? I'd never experienced them before. In fact I don't think I'd ever really experienced general hypomania before only excitement related to specific projects or areas of interest.I'm unable to find much online about this here's onegtClinicians agree that cannabis use can cause acute adverse mental effects that mimic psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.gt...gtCannabis abuse prior to development of bipolar disorder has a significant effect on firstepisode mania and on the course of the disease. Another study reported that using cannabis at baseline can significantly increase the risk for manic symptoms during follow up.httpswww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpmcarticlesPMC2811144,Bipolar

I have been stable for years and have even been told my bipolar is in remission but still see a med prescriber for anxiety. She talks down to me and speaks to me in a manipulative way that feels like subtle interrogation. She puts me in a situation where I dont have the option to say no to going to see a therapist for something minor I brought up casually about getting flushed when Im in public... it feels like there is a subtle implication that there will be some type of consequence if I dont comply. I have never seen a med prescriber in over 10 years who hasnt treated me like a potential criminal and like theyre keeping tabs.

I didnt eat for 3 days after then binged on the worst hospital food. I wish I said no.

I've made an appointment with a psychiatrist which I will be seeing next month and in the meantime I've been researching medications. One particular one I've been interested in is lamictal. It seems perfect for me since I suffer more from bipolar depression as opposed to mania plus it doesn't seem to have as worrisome side effects as lithium.

45446,45442,Wondering If Im Bipolar... So for as long as I can remember Ive had issues with mental health. It didnt get bad until around 12 when I started selfharming and eventually I was hospitalized at 14 after a suicide attempt. There I was put on Zoloft for depression and also diagnosed with anxiety. For a few months I felt happy so I figured it was working. I stopped cutting I felt good. Eventually I just stopped taking it without a doctors consent but I took myself off of it slowly. I started cutting again after that. Thats my only experience with doctorspsychologists since and Im 19 turning 20 in 5 months. I had my first hallucination when I was 16 but the timeline is so bad and foggy because my brain literally cant remember anything besides the event itself I was in the shower and just like flicking a switch I thought somebody was in the bathroom with me trying to get me. Immediately I opened the curtains to find nothing but still wasnt convinced. I went to my room thinking something was following me from behind the entire time and closed my door psychotically looking around for whatever was there trying to get me. For about 3 hours I sat in the corner of my room looking back and forth between things that would just escape my direct line of sight it was like I could only see the things trying to get me in the corner of my eye. I wouldnt move off my bed in fear that it was under my bed and would snatch me that way. It felt so real at the time. I forgot it even happened the next day and didnt remember it until months later when it randomly popped into my mind but I couldnt place it along a coherent timeline only that it had happened sometime that same year. A few months after I remembered the event I was in class and out of nowhere just like last time I thought somebody who in my head looked similar to the girl from the ringexorcist was inside the room with me. I started darting my eyes everywhere making sure that she wasnt it felt real but apart of me knew it wasnt but that didnt help it go away. All throughout the day I continued feeling like she was right behind a closed door or peaking out at me from somewhere. On the bus ride home I was convinced she was somehow following me in vans in cars buildings this thing that was following me didnt adhere to the normal rules of transportation she could transport between buildings just to keep an eye on me. It happened about three or four times varying on levels of intensity for about two weeks and that was the last time Ive had delusions or hallucinations if thats even what they are. Now fast forward to 2017 where after smoking weed one night I get put into this semicatatonic state where I felt unreal like a joke and like where I lived and the people around me were fake too. All kinds of memories of my childhood were playing on fastforward on my head except I was outside looking at my younger self and it was terrifying I was convinced that I was actually going to die. Now this experience is druginduced but after this first time I began having experiences like this without being high and the thoughts couldnt leave my mind I felt unreal fake all the time and occasionally I wouldnt be able to view the world around me as real or the people. This happened between July 2017 December 2017 and its just starting to subside after I quit weed a few days ago. But while it was happening it left me in a severe depression. Now since the new year I have been energetic and positive I feel better about my body which all throughout my life I have struggled with and have positive thoughts about it. And not just I love my body! its more like I can 100 fix my body and make it how I want it! I didnt sleep for 40 hours straight albeit a 2.5 hour nap before my shift. During work I was talkative which I NEVER am and had something to say to about 99 of the customers. It was almost as if when the thought popped in my head no matter what it was I had to say it. Nothing inappropriate mostly just about the products or casual talk or responses but it was so natural. My answers are NEVER natural because I have social anxiety Im always rethinking it before I say it. But not this time. I bagged their groceries so fast I couldnt stop singing songs in my head occasionally singing them outloud in front of customers and not feeling embarrassed like casual singing when you have a song stuck in your head except it was a few different songs When I wasnt with a customer I couldnt not be moving my hands my legs etc.Once I got home I became obsessed with watching and rewatching and tweeting about my favorite show. I had so many thoughts about the show and my favorite characters that I just had to put them out there. I think I tweeted about 500600 times within 6 hours. On top of that I was also writing some characters for a TV show Im writing and usually Im a little stunted w writing because Im usually depressed but it was like I could write for ages. I wrote like 10 characters within an hour. This has been going on since the New Year and Ive gotten a total of... less than 20 hours of sleep within 5 days. And now I just got the idea that I want to finally get my license so I can get a car and runaway. I know logically the plan seems bad but its like I have no intention of doing anything else? Like all of my effort is going into that plan. And lastly on top of all this I havent eaten one meal since the new year and I dont feel hungry at all. No desire to eat really albeit a few snacks here and there. Ive had past experiences with being energetic so I always speculated whether I was bipolar but never like this. 90 of the time I have been depressedSo sorry this was long but please how do I know if this is really bipolar? Since these symptoms started Ive also become obsessed with researching hypomaniamania and the thought will not leave my brain. So am I just making the symptoms up or am I actually bipolar?????,Bipolar

46508,46501,Transitioning Treatment from Symptoms to Behaviors So Ive been officially diagnosed with bipolar for about a year now. I had been diagnosed as all sorts of things before we settled on this. The medication has been working well now that Im on the right things and Ive made a couple lifestyle changes like spending less time with my more reckless friends and not sleeping because I just could. And all of that has been going very well and so is therapy. But this week I had a realization about how messed up a lot of my mental relationships with things like sex and my past romantic relationships. On particular the combination of those two things and a lot of anger and shame about how Ive handled things in the past. What I realized this week in therapy was my perspective has been all about limiting symptoms and episodes Ive been sleeping cause it makes me feel better. But I have been mad at myself for a long time about how I handled a breakup without changing the underlying behavior and not thinking about how it has kept me in the same place. And that is an awesome realization. But what scares me is contending with the behavior. How Im going to change what Im doing not how I feel. I realize the two are connected but adding the other mode is scary. Ive always thought that you can say I did this because of my bipolar and that explains the behavior but doesnt excuse it. I just wanted to ask if people have gone through a similar process? And if so how did it go and how did they deal with it? Thank you ,Bipolar

Sometimes I get to experience long intervals of depression. Sometimes I go on a 3 week manic bender. Through all of these ups and downs I have to consistently work to survive. Yet when I need a leave of absence I get told my job cannot be guaranteed. The funny part is this industry has horrible job retention. Well its because they pay shit and treat you like shit and make you do the job of 34 departments but do not increase your pay and all the roles get looped into a miscellaneous tasks section in the job description. What hurts most is the way colleagues talk about people with mental health disorders like theyre an annoying object. This bipolar mom this un medicated dad.. if they would just take their meds. I have been in a manic episode where I had to go home because the impulses were going to overcome my civility. Why is there no room for me? I chose this field to help. Yet no one here wants to help. We are supposed to be professionals not letting out bias skew our service. Yet I see the attacks and I feel them for these clients too. Thats me. I am on that side.

I'm applying to a million jobs right now. But I have always done so much better with structure and routine. It's only been two weeks and I already feel myself slipping into a depressed episode. I realized today I hasn't gotten dressed or left my house in 5 days. I went for a 2 mile walk today just to get dressed and out of the house. My sister who I live with even commented on the fact that I was dressed today. I can feel myself slipping but not sure what to do about it. I dont have any income so I cant go out and do much right now nothing that costs money at least. And I dont have a car either to really go anywhere. I just dont want to get stuck in a depression right now when so much of my life needs to be changing. Any suggestions on creating some sort of structure and routine when I have no job no classes and no money? I'm thinking about trying to go walking everyday just to get out of the house.

When I look in the mirror I do not recognize myself I dont even know what I think I look like in my head its really hard for me to picture my face.

46990,46979,Life changing I posted awhile back about meds change. The effectiveness of meds hits me quick so the change was pretty much overnight. Prior to the change my body hurt all the time. I was always exhausted I longed for my couch. I had no motivation to clean my disaster of a house or car. 2 days after taking the new meds I cleaned out my car. Its still covered in dog hair but not trash. I just went to the store and bought black hefty bags and am going to throw out all the stuff thats been accumulating in my house over the years. Ive been out with friends. Ive been socializing more with coworkers and the brain fog has lifted making conversation easier. It has been years since Ive felt this way. Its amazing. I want to do as much as I possibly can while this lasts. I cant help but feel itll be taken away and I want to be productive but not overly manicproductive. Ive got all the windows open when I usually have the blinds drawn. Its a beautiful day and my house needs airing out. The best part is my father who was against meds for years pointed out the fact that meds can plateau and you might need to switch them up. And then if those stop working you might need to switch back to the original meds. I was blown away. He did all of this research on his own. My shitty mother stayed silent then started talking about herself as usual. But I didnt care. Im lucky to have my dad and to have a successful meds switch. Just wanted to share.

I'm still in the introductory stage with my new doctor so she's still reassessing me again but I did provide her my previous doctor's certification of my BD diagnosis and prescription history. So I guess I'm just looking for reassurance about this new regimen for BD. Please note that I communicate with my doctor i.e. I ask her what to lookout for when taking this medicine and I also read material about this but it's always good to hear from other people.,Bipolar

Some part of me figured if I was gonna lose it I'd lose it instantly I guess. So I didn't notice when the impending sense of doom came back.. does anyone else feel like you're holding your breath waiting to breath but the breathing never comes and it's slowly crushing you?? Between that I've started to believe something bad is gonna happen to me. I can physically feel I'm not interpretting the world the way I used to on my meds...

Mania ruined my life I miss my old life the way things use to be I work so hard for everything and went thru so much in life just to destroy it all. Now its been almost 5 month and I try to start over went to a new school and trying to make new friends everything and it hurts so bad because it doesnt compare to the life I use to have. I need some help. How do you rebuild everything!

46657,46648,Bipolar 1 doesnt seem to cover it anymore. Schizoaffective anybody? I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 amp CPTSD repetitive childhood trauma and abuse 4 years ago. Mainly after a severe 6mo. Long manic episode in which I was convinced I was indestructible and a direct channel of god resulting in multiple unintended near death experiences related to drugs alcohol and physical safety. Long story short bipolar in itself has been one hell of a show. Since my first severe episode I have experienced a multitude of smaller shorter lived episodes 2 out of 4 which would probably even fall in the hypomanic category. The depression always lasts much longer usually 23X times longer than the initial mania but it never comes with out visual amp auditory hallucinations explosive anger psychosis and catatonic moments lasting no less than 3 hours at a time. Im 21 years old. The lines are starting to get blurry. I dont know where the episodes end and begin. I am scared as fuck and have had a handful of clarity moments that reveal the way my brain seems to be slipping through my fingers. I tried to tapper off my lithium my doc is on board thinking that much of this time spent somewhere else staring at a wall only to snap back a few hours later confused as to where the time went was just because of my high dose of 1250mg lithium carbonate. Ive tapered down to 300mg at night and 300mg in the morning and my partner has started to point out that I seem to exhibit ALL symptoms of bipolar each day simultaneously and more consistently. Redditors Im usually better spoken but my brains in shambles and Im eager for you to make me think deeper on this and reflect before I word barf it to my psych. Anyway. Im not to familiar with schizo effective but am starting to feel that could possibly be more fitting. I dont want more meds in my life. Im also an avid micro dosed lsd dmt amp earth medicine user for some background and am very on board with alternative medicine to get me back to reality. At least one I can be comfortable in.,Bipolar
45631,45626,Anyone else have trouble consistently taking their meds? Just last year while in jail actually after coming down from a manic episode and then spiraling further into the latter I was finally confronted again with my type 1 bipolar diagnosis. I was lit back on my meds depakote ER trazadone gabapentin and prasosin and stayed on them until being transferred to a rehab facility as a result of trauma undiagnosedmisdiagnosed bipolar I developed a really shitty and extreme addiction issues where they were hostilic and took me off my meds. One manic episode in and they made a exception for that rule quickly....lol. after that and making a timeline of my relapses and it being made clear as day that taking my meds for me is a matter of life and death because of my addiction I stayed on them and stable for a few months. I had a slip where I stopped taking my meds went manic after a week relapsed but was able to catch myself before everything went to shit...but again a few months later the same thing happened I wasn't so lucky and have been stuck in another relapse for a few months and self medicating.I now find myself very aware I need my meds. J talked to my therapist today who essentially told me that I need to accept my diagnosis and that I need to take my meds if I want to succeed based on all the past times I've tried anything otherwise. I've had intentions of calling my psych doctor I plan to but I'll pick up the phone and put it down. Or procrastinate it. When manic I'll say that it will keep me from fulfilling my purpose or take away my ability to feel fully and see the future. I KNOW I need to. I plan on calling first thing tomorrow for the first possible appointment. I want to get better. But I won't stop fucking myself over.Does anyone else have this issue? Or can relate? I'm just now starting to realize I'm not crazy or alone and it's in fact my bipolar that's effecting my life like this. And I would appreciate anyone who has similar issue's input on this.

46422,46415,Idk if Im manic but Im not doing well I dont know if Im manic or whats going on. I was super stable for about 2 months. Very motivated productive going to sleep early and waking up early etc. I think it slowly ramped up to the point where I was out of the house doing school work or going to the gym or eating out or working like 16 hours a day making big plans etc. Everything seemed really beautiful and i think around that point I started to realize I was manic. Then this past week or two Ive begun drinking and smoking every night if Im sober I feel like buzzing out of my skin. Ive been hungover for days and I think Im acrually getting the flu now. The thing is I dont exactly feel manic anymore but I dont feel depressed either. Im not out being productive like I was at the beginnings of the episode I generally feel more on edge and tense? Like instead of having a bunch of positive energy i have more intense or stressed energy? I cant eat more than a few bites of anything with out getting nauseas even if I smoke and get the munchies. Im eating maybe like 500 calories a day not including alcohol. I cant sleep unless I smoke. The other day I worked 8 hours went out drinking all night slept for 4 hours and then went back and worked an 8 hour shift. I took a test still drunk from the night before and got a 92. Im going to the gym every other day just because I like the communal energy. I dont really know what Im getting at here. I guess I just feel sick as fuck from drinking all week and barely eating. But despite feeling sick I still feel like going out and being social. But I dont feel all positive and motivated like I did at the beginning? Idk whats going on.,Bipolar

45535,45531,My Current Battle with Employment Discrimination This is a long story so I'll try to keep it as brief as I can and only include pertinent details. For those that just want a brief summaryTLDR the Peace Corps rejected me because I admitted to having bipolar not thinking anything of it because I am high functioning and my doctor can clear me. I decided to fight this to the bitter end since I am not my mental illness and they can't reject me based on their discriminatory and outright archaic assumptions about the conditionI am a 23 year old college student that will graduate this spring with degrees in Biology and French. Three years back I was diagnosed BP II and as most of you know it was a wild ride. By communicating with my psychiatrist and by making the right lifestyle choices I have remained totally asymptomatic for more than a year.Being young and hoping to join Doctor's Without Borders someday I decided I would join the Peace Corps to gain the necessary public health program experience and to expand my French I'm looking at West Africa. I spent a large amount of time working on my resume and statement and kept in touch with my local Peace Corps recruiter. He gave me advice and assured me that I was a shoein for a position in Benin because of my health care experience and language experience I work as a fulltime Rec Therapist while finishing classes full time. Not easy but incorporating the right lifestyle choices has helped my time management.After I turned in my application I was informed that I would have to fill out a Health History form divulging any medical conditions that I had. Naturally I was honest my doctor said he'd provide a letter clearing me medically and my recruiter already said verbatim that I am extremely qualifiedWhat happened next blew me away. An automated email was sent to me after I turned in the Health History form informing me that my condition could not be supported in the country I chose. Not one person from the organization would speak to me further about the issue. I've been told dozens of times about how they're sorry but they simply don't make those decisions. What's really shocked me is that my resume and essay we're not even looked at because of admitting the condition.I have been hiding my mental health ever since my diagnosis. It has not affected my professional life or my work. I am high functioning and need no more accommodation than a healthy volunteer whatever that is. Having them reject me for checking the wrong box made me incredibly angry and hurt. But instead of accepting this I've been fighting it for the past 2 months. I've called senators lawyers mental health advocacy groups and have begun the informal resolution process with their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. When they asked what I hoped to get out of this process I told them that I want to be medically cleared and that I want them to put an end to this discriminatory process. Odds are they will not give me an inch so I am prepared to take this to District Court there was a case in 1996 where a volunteer was rejected because she admitted to taking antidepressants. The court ruled in her favor and this decision gives me hope.The most exciting development will come the end of this month. Patrick J. Kennedy nephew of John F. Kennedy who coincidentally founded the Peace Corps will be coming to my city to advocate for mental health rights. Patrick Kennedy was diagnosed with bipolar himself so I'm doing everything in my power to go to the conference and talk to him get him a letter anything if there's an offhand chance to get him to lobby the PC on my behalf I need to take it.I'm not giving up this fight until I receive my letter of acceptance or until they tell me stop calling us or we will contact the police. I will let you guys know the newest updates as they come up if you have any ideas for me on how to fight this archaic government process please throw your ideas here.As always never give up trying new things to get your condition under control. It is possible and things will get better if you try.,Bipolar

46492,46485,I can't trust my memories I had a pretty extended hypomanic episode in NovDec and a few weeks into the episode I had a longawaited pdoc appointment at a specialized mood disorder clinic. I came out of the appointment very upset because the doctor didn't seem to want to help me didn't seem to get what I was saying wanted me to stop taking the meds that had pulled me out of a yearlong suicidal depression. I hadn't slept more than an hour the night before so the appointment is a bit of a blur but I felt betrayed by the system and cried for hours.I saw the pdoc for a second time today and my impression of her was completely different. Apparently she is not a psycho monster bitch. She clearly wants to help me and has a reasonable approach even if it's not what I would have chosen.I also realized that I have gaps in my memory from that time like I know one of my friends was concerned enough about my state of mind to call my mother but for example I completely don't remember one of my friends coming over and visiting me for several hours. Granted I was drinking a lot over that period but not enough to completely forget events. It makes me wonder what else I'm not remembering.I'm diagnosed BPII but I know that over about 6 weeks I spent way too much money hardly slept or sometimes even didn't for days at a time and drove so recklessly that I could have been arrested if I had been caught. I just didn't go to work a few times. Also had a few panic attacks. I had some pretty big ideas but I wasn't psychotic so manic vs. hypomanic? Don't really know don't really care too much but I normally consider myself a very grounded and rational person so feeling like I can't trust my memory freaks me the fuck out.I guess this is more of a vent than anything. It's the first hypomanic episode I've had that can compete with milder depressive episodes in terms of negative impact on my life. I don't really know how to come to terms with the fact that I can't trust my memory from that time. Especially because according to friends I seemed pretty lucid but my judgement was obviously impaired.Anyway bipolar sucks.,Bipolar

I am in the process of getting in to see a psychiatrist in the new state but I have to see a case worker first and that is over a month away.

50496,50647,Im new Im very recently diagnosed in conjunction w ASD. Im just very scared of my head Im scared of the way my brain makes me think and I am scared of how little control I have over it. Ive no idea what world Ive entered into mostly because I dont understand much yet despite wanting to. Ive studied psychology at university before dropping out multiple times and its so easy to look at things on the outside and understand them but to look introspectively is so difficult. Its difficult to analyse the thoughts I should and shouldnt listen to. Its difficult to place or recognise moments of irritability excitement etc. Sometimes Im panicking without even knowing Im panicking or why. Im just very much in a state of barely knowing whats going on in my head until the aftermath unless its depressive thoughts those are pretty easy to figure out and by far the most common for me. People near me just say I shouldnt think that way but its hard explaining why I feel I have no control over how I genuinely feel if that makes sense. Does it get better?

50268,50402,I feel like I'm subtly giving up and I can't stop Background I'm bipolar 2. I'm a 42 year old man. In addition to the bipolar I'm autistic and have been severely abused throughout my life. My wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. I'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. I blamed myself but it doesn't change anything. She also left me with both of our kids who I love a lot they're 10 and 15. We've decided to slow date again and see if we can actually be together but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. Yeah I know it's a really bad sign but I have to try for me.Now I can't stop sobbing all the time. Like hard hurt sobbing. I'm in therapy and I'm on meds. I'm not actively suicidal but I am starting to worry that I might be slipping into a suicidal trance. I think about it daily and I keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it. I don't really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage there's a lot there and a LOT of people would tell me don't give her a second chance including my 15 year old. I feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm she's caused me. But let's get back on subject. Today when I was signing out of work on Slack I typed Bye to my boss unconsciously I've never done that before it's always been See you Monday or something else. I held my 3 cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them. I wandered around the house I work from home after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room. I don't know what my brain is trying to get me ready for but I'm scared of myself right now. I can't really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward I might lose custody of the kids because of it even though they've both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left. So here I am. I don't know what is happening I'm scared and I have no where to really turn at the moment.,Bipolar

46024,46018,Doubting my BPII Diagnosis Apprehensive About Meds Feeling Like a Fake TLDR Im afraid that I was never hypomanic in the first place and it was all in my head Labelling Theory my current medication while effective is dulling my moodscognitionmemory and could be dangerous to keep taking in the longterm if Im not really bipolar and I dont know what to do.Ill preface this by saying that Im not seeking medical advice or rediagnosis just venting and looking for general advice or shared experiences from people who know they have bipolar. I dont feel comfortable opening up to my therapist about this because she doesnt believe me and I have a strainedweird relationship with my psych. Apologies in advance for the wall of text.So history. I was initially diagnosed with MDD in late high school but had recurring episodes since age 13 put on Zoloft and once I titrated up on a higher dose I started to feel restless and hyper to the point where I wondered if those were side effects. So I googled and found out what hypomania was. Even though a lot of the symptoms were similar what I was experiencing wasnt as harmful or destructive. I also did not experience the two suspected episodes for very long maybe 45 days TOPS. In fact I was very productive and somehow ended up doing paid work for this relatively wellknown animatorillustrator on the internet that I wouldve otherwise never dared to message out of the blue. So I wasnt too concerned. It was psychomotor agitation and racing thoughts that made me uncomfortable but those arent exclusive to hypomania. Other stuff happened but I dont want to write a laundry list of symptomsactions.But then I saw things like Even if you have the slightest concern it can turn into fullblown mania!! Especially if you have a bipolar relative!! and my anxiety kicked in. I stopped seeing my psych for unrelated reasons and cut off my meds. Then something traumatic happened which triggered a year long depression. So I got a new psych that diagnosed me as BP2.However in retrospect Im wondering if I exaggerated my hypomanic symptoms and made myself believe I experienced it after researching it. What if that euphoria was really just the happiness from getting out of a depression and accomplishing new things in life? I got second opinions from other professionals who disagree with my psych and suggested ADHD dysthymia or even a vague personality disorder big NO for the latter. So Im confused.Its been a year since Ive been on medication Lamictal and Klonopin and Ive been tracking my moods on Daylio. Aside from good days bad days and occasional daylong blips of intense moods its so purple. Neutral. But Im functioning well! Im so glad that I have not been suicidal for so long but it feels as though my emotions have been dulled or flattened. Happiness is just mild contentment. Seeing other people cry at a funeral without being able to feel their pain feels so uncomfortable. If I were truly bipolar I would have definitely had at least one hypomanic episode by now but it hasnt happened. With these meds I also get brain fog every once in a while and I feel that my memory is much poorer.I was actually thinking of switching to another psych I live far from my current one and my mother hates her so that I can explain my situation and try something different. But if my current medications are working to an extent is it worth it? If Im not actually bipolar staying on this medication for the longterm might do more harm to my body than good. No matter how you look at it all of this is risky.Does anyone have any personal experience that is similar to this? Thoughts or advice?,Bipolar
50036,50142,Dont believe it This is headed into a rant..I was diagnosed BP2 after one visit with a psych. Put on lamicital and here Ive been for two years. Im not bipolar the meds arent helping.

Ive also been dealing with marriage straina pandemic a major surgery the chronic pain and long term issues from that surgery and a new high stress job. Its been a busy couple of years. Those are life factors that can make anyone go off their baseline. I dont want to be given a dx because I can fit a checklist that day and then some meds to make me foggy.I have been letdown by so many healthcare providers.

45663,45658,Lamictal Pristiq Wellbutrin Bad Combination? Hey all First I am a male in my early 20s.I have been struggling to find the right mix of medication for me. I am not formally diagnosed with BP my doctor classified it as depression at the beginning.My experiences with medications began about five years ago. I originally started with small doses of Pristiq Desvenlafaxine and Wellbutrin Bupropion HCL XL. 50mg of Pristiq and 150mg of Bupropion. Still didn't feel 'right' so the doses got upped over the course of a year or two. I eventually was taking 450mg of Bupropion and 200mg of Pristiq.A year or so later my doctor added Lamictal Lamotrigene. Began at 50mg went to 100mg and eventually 200mg. At this same time my doctor decreased my dosage of Pristiq. I was taking 100mg Pristiq 450 mg Bupropion 200mg Lamictal. Lamictal seemingly helped the most out of all the drugs. I was not feeling extremely low ever i.e. hurt myself.Looking back it seems like a whole lot of medications...did I really need all that? I began to feel suppressed. While I didn't experience extreme lows their was not any highs either. It was just flatlined. My sex drive was also nonexistent. I am in my early 20sAfter speaking with my Dr. we decided to lower some of my doses. He briefly told me what lowering the doses of each of my medications would do and he gave me the liberty of experimenting a bit. I slowly trickled down to what I am currently on 25mg of Pristiq 150mg Bupropion 200mg Lamictal. I do not feel as emotionally suppressed as I once was nor do I feel extreme lows. Everything seems to be okay aside from a few things. I know that life isn't perfect and being 'happy' all the time isn't normal but I do feel like I am missing some happiness in my life. Another major issue is my sex drive. It is still completely ruined and it is beginning to affect my life and overall wellbeing.I guess my questions are Was taking all three of those medicines at high doses a bad thing? In other words is my doctor not giving good advice? Should I seek out a 'second opinion'? Are there any ways to combat the sexual side effects that you have successfully utilized? Should I consider talking with a doctor my current Dr. or a new one about changing things up if so do you have any personal experience that would lead you to suggest a specific change here?Thank you for all of the help! If I am missing something in my post or you need clarification please let me know.,Bipolar
45735,45730,Lowering the doses of my meds fairly mild triggers For most of my life I have been on huge doses of a lot of medications which made me slow clumsy and stupid. I am not like any of those things naturally. I have been terrified of changing anything because it almost always leads to suicidal urges and self harm. When my previous psychiatrist changed me from risperdal to geodon I had a manic episode that lasted several months. I ended up in the hospital 5150 suicide attempt lots of cutting. When she put me on serroquel I had such bad vertigo and extreme sedation that I stumbled into a wall and broke my nose.I changed to a new psychiatrist about 3 months ago. She wanted to to start reducing my meds. I was willing to try because of the effing side effects and also the fact that the meds don't begin to control my symptoms.We lowered lamictal waaaay too fast long story. I was off it for about 2 weeks after taking 400mg a day for many years. I just went nuts when it was all out of my system. I felt suicidal urges that seemed uncontrollable and like I might try though it was against my will. I cut myself up. My dearest husband has worked from home for the last 3 weeks keeping me safe. I'm now on 100mg of lamictal and I'm hypomanic. I feel awesome. Everything has calmed down and this dose feels good. I'm more alert and I have some energy. I'm scared about what it will be like to reduce some of my other meds but I want to do it. Has anybody else had trouble changing meds or doses of meds? Is my body just freaky? These last few weeks have been hell. Sorry this is so long!,Bipolar

On top on that I've gained so much weight since being on them and I'm just so fucking tired all day every day. I'm just so over it all. Like everything. I haven't worked in like three years because I'll lose my insurance if I can even manage to find something I'm able to do.

46031,46025,Recently diagnosed I never really thought that I had anything other than depression that came and went but after something happened a few months ago I figured I would talk to a professional. After talking for a while she diagnosed me with bi polar disorder.I always just thought that the periods between depression were just that but she pointed out some things that I never really noticed occurring during the times that I didnt feel depressed. like extremely high energy not sleeping really really obsessive behavior. I get super into one thing or another and thats the only thing I can focus on for like a week and after that Ive lost all interest in it. Like a while ago I started researching how to brew better coffee. Next thing I know Ive spent nearly a grand on coffee makers and different coffee beans and am making like 10 cups a day its all I could think about. About a week later I have no interest in touching any of it and I start feeling depressed again. Sorry if that sounds weird that was just an example. She asked me to do research on my own to see if I think that fits but Im not sure. I figured I could talk to other people who are also diagnosed. ,Bipolar
46188,46182,Things dont feel quite real. I sometimes get into these fogs of feeling like my life isnt mine or that its all not real. I have a cold and my partner just handed me Nyquil to take before bed it felt like the pills crumbled or disintegrated in my hands for a split second Ive seenfelt this before in the car when I look at building or the road sometimes for a split second it looks like the buildings or the the world around me crumblesdisintegrates kind of like the movie Inception if that make sense. Ive been in a mixed episode for almost 5 months and keep get snip bits of this feeling. Last year my sister in law essentially took my personal experiences having Bipolar and claiming it as their own experience observed from their many behaviors this person shows symptoms of BPD and factitious disorder this kind of fucked with my head a bit. I am someone who constantly tries to make themselves feel guilty I obsess and try to convince myself my problems arent as bad as they seem because I dont want to come off as pretentious or as a victim recently I shared with extended in laws that I have bipolar in the context of the conversation we were having one of them was a social worker and I had a lovely conservation with her about it that made me feel open and comfortable. However in sharing this I feel like I am coming off as though Im victimizing myself or trying to gain sympathyeven though that wasnt my intention. This is making me feel like my experiences arent real and that Im just pretending to even though I know what my life has been from my memories but I keep questioning if they are real? I keep questioning if anything is real. And Im kind of terrified. It isnt that extreme but maybe it will get worse I dont know Im very confused... anyone ever experience this?,Bipolar
49994,50097,I hear people singing and music when I get manic? Does anyone else have this happen to them? It's very strange.I remember maybe when I was 7 I would be confused as to if music was actually playing.It doesn't happen too often but it's peculiar when it does. I became more consciously aware of this when I was maybe 13. I remember being restless because I could hear music but it was too clear for it to be real. I went outside my bed and didn't hear anything.I was talking to my psychiatrist maybe 2 days ago about it. If you want you can take a quick scroll through my post history but basicallyGot sexually harassed badly from a supervisor. He told told me sexual things about my body and told me he liked sliding in and coming insideWhen I reported it the manager cut my hours to zero. I have to pay for rent and food not to mention how it felt to muster up the courage to report it and then right face retaliation. I've never experienced this kind of devastation before. I can't even describe how painful the act of retaliation in itself was. I was aware I might not be believed but I didn't think I'd get punished.So I told my psychiatrist about it and almost cried. I'm still processing this information and I'm struggling. I really am.Sometimes it's music playing. More often actual music will be playing and I hear an actual person singing along with the song but they aren't. It's the most bizzare thing. I have to stare at their lips and they won't be moving. But I hear their singing very clearly.Has anything like this happened to others before?But thank God for meds. I've dipped in and out of suicidal fantasy because of it but overall it's been ok. I still have panic attacks when my throat closes up and I have to step away to cough it out andor drink water. But again thank God for meds.I'm not going to ask for a higher dosage yet though. I think I'm stable if not for this happening. Anyways that's such a tangent. So I guess that's a question rant I have for yall.,Bipolar
49926,50023,On suicide The past few months I've been struggling with persistent suicide ideation and even attempted during a major depressive episode. But instead of saying it's just a symptom of your disease I would like to walk you through my thought process. The argument from circumstance. Right now I am unemployed with no realistic chance of getting a job. My resume is spotty and the market I operated in pretty much collapsed. My memory focus and cognitive skills are pretty much gone after having two psychoses in a year. A low skilled job almost always requires a drivers license which I'm not capable of I tried. Furthermore I have a criminal record from the things I did during my psychosis excluding me from most jobs in my field anyways. I'm lonely and have no support system no friends or family that can offer any stability. Meaning that within a year or so I'll be forced to sell my house and eventually live on the streets. Homelessness is not a reason for suicide of course nor is unemployment but it's also something I'd rather not do. Yet it is almost unavoidable. The argument from harm. My actions whether in psychosis depression mania anger or just because who I am have caused irreparable emotional and material damage. My continued existence is a danger to society and will always incur tremendous cost through health care living on the streets and I've had multiple encounters with the police during both manic and depressive episodes. While one could argue that all life is ultimately detrimental in my case it's fairly obvious I cause harm without being able to effectively control it and I do not wish to cause any more harm. The self image of a calm collected person is a fever dream in reality I'm just a unstable criminally psychotic mental health patient. The argument from hopelessness. You might argue well maybe you'll find a job some friends maybe even love and what you did in the past might not happen again. Living on the streets is an adventure! Unfortunately it might also not be the case. I've always had a pessimistic and depressed outlook and whether that is caused by brain abnormalities or not almost seems irrelevant life has always been a struggle and I do not want to continue this struggle. It's hopeless really I just kinda fumbled my way into an impossible situation. The argument from despair. Although perhaps a majority of people disagrees with the following I believe society is on the brink of collapse and within our projected lifetimes things will likely only get worse. Without going into the precise reasons for believing this I feel like it's almost uncontroversial to say things are bad and they'll get worse. For the longest time I held a certain morbid curiosity for this lets see how this plays out but after my depressive psychosis which was a traumatizing hell I quite simply no longer have the desire to see it. The argument from meaning. Commonly the argument against suicide goes what about the people you leave behind. The two people I still have in my life pretty much said we get it just make sure your affairs are in order. So that's not a real argument for me personally. But in the abstract you might say you owe it to the world to do your best to which my mind always replies no. I have nothing to contribute anyways but if life is simply reduced to doing the meaningless bidding of others in order to perpetuate some bizarre notion of you must work to live even if life is miserable then I simply refuse to play that game. But even if it is not miserable which it will be because my brain is broken is life then simply some egocentric hedonism find pleasure in something. I mean that's also a little bit of a hollow existence. Someone once said to me life just is there is no purpose or meaning to it which is fair. But then not living really seems like a choice and I can choose to stop it. The argument from personality. Nobody likes a pseudointellectual climate activist with anticapitalist tendencies that has a mental health disorder and will probably live on the streets. Especially not one that studied AI and philosophy. Especially not ... you can fill in all the stereotypes feel free to pick the ones you hate the most. Now you might say just shut up then and be normal I quite literally can't. You can't just say change your personality. I have seen so many death threats on social media it's worrying in its own right. So that's it that's the thought process. I'm just too tired I have lived an acceptable life. I've known riches and wealth love and the depths of thought. But it's done. Life will always end there is even some beauty in the idea that I get to pick when.,Bipolar

I feel like I want to reach them all.Anyhow going through a mental health transition. Seeking help Ive felt that I needed for a long time now. I could only repress myself for so long. This last melt down completely broke me. My life that I created is in my eyes perfect. Ive worked so hard to have it all to not be my mom. And yet here I am in the shower tears blending with the water and my dog is scratching at the door to get in. But in that moment I wanted everything to stop. Even my heart. I pulled myself out of the shower. Looked in the mirror. Wiped my eyes and smiled. I couldnt convince myself I was ok but maybe I could to my husband. Got dressed went downstairs. Tried folding some laundry. Tried hiding. Tried holding back. But I looked at him and completely lost it. Immediately I made an appointment with my primary that week. From there I have now sought out a therapist and psychiatrist. Ive since tried new medications. Not to much help. How am I supposed to feel? Bipolar 2 is my official diagnosis. However I always mask and mask and mask and pretend. Im very high functioning. Before my meltdown I was the most manic Ive ever been. Reckless. Hyper sexual my husband loved that part. No sleep. Busy busy busy. What can I get into next? Whats going to keep me from crashing? Constantly on the go. And the second I withdraw in the slightest people are surprised. What do you mean you dont want to go out? You dont want to talk and socialize? Why are you being so anxious? BECAUSE THIS IS WHO I AM. Ive been so fucking good at keeping this up I trick myself. But only for so long. Other people I had convinced. Which brings me here. Im now trying another medication AND was told that marijuana isnt a great match for bipolar which is a fucking bummer. I love my maryjane. However I am dedicated and took my vows seriously. I want to be the best me wife daughter sister and friend I can be. This process is hard and challenging. I want to be open with those around me about this struggle. But for now I think I need to understand it myself before the outside world can get it. Well thanks for sticking around this long if your still reading. This journey is hard but worth it. Exhausting but rewarding. Everyone keep your head up. Its so fucking hard.

45812,45807,My new psychiatrist doesn't agree with my current diagnosis Starting in 2009 age 17 I had increasingly awful depression reaching a peak in late 2014 age 22 when I checked myself into hospital for 5 days outpatient then 7 days inpatient. After this my meds were switched from Paxil and Abilify to Effexor XR. In early 2017 age 24 after gradually increasing the Effexor I was bumped to 225mg a day. This sent me into a hypo manic episode for a week until I dropped it back to 150mg. My body couldn't keep up with my mind I had no filter and I did things without thinking.This lead to my psych to change my diagnosis from Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder Type 2 rapid cycling as we believed that this wouldn't have happened if I didn't have bipolar paired with how I had described my depressive episodes as wavelikeebbing and growing for years. I added on lithium 300mg 2xday at this time.Now I'm in a new state and have a new psych age 25. I went to her last week for Rx refills and because I had the worst shortterm depression in years. I couldn't work or even get out of bed for 5 days.She says the the Effexor Lithium combo seems to have helped with some issues anxiety bulimia selfharm but isn't doing enough for the depression. She upped my Lithium to 300mg 3xday and is seeing me March 13th. Her main issue is that I don't have any issues with sleep during my up periods. I sleep normally. When I'm depressed I sleep a lot more and have trouble getting up in the morning.What my issue is If I don't have bipolar what are the other possible disorders I could have? What runs similarly to bipolar but isn't? Is there such thing as cyclical depression? If I don't have bipolar what the hell was that episode in early 2017? I asked my new psych something like this when I saw her but she didn't have an answer for me just shrugged it off...I'm not asking that you diagnose me just what is similar to bipolarEdit added info,Bipolar

50474,50624,Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately that psych ward didnt keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.This resulted in asking my inlaws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly I wasnt really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. Well my inlaws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner their child is unfit I am less worried about that. My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right.

45864,45858,A tiered approach to medication Lately Ive read a lot about medications people are being prescribed and their feelings towards them and I want to share my feelings on this. I am not a doctor. Bipolar patients need mood stabilizers. Lithium or lamictal. That is what treats your mood disorder and for the most part what you will always need. Other symptoms either bipolar in nature or created by the mood stabilizer get treated by other secondary meds. Insomnia? Probably seroquel. Psychotic features? Probably abilify. Tremors? Gabapentin. Anxiety? Stay the fuck away from benzos even if they try to give them to you. Is this generally the consensus? I feel like in the mental health community people just think drugs are drugs and maybe something will work eventually. That feels sad from my perspective. I do 1800mg Li along with 10g seroquel to sleep as needed 25mg bupropion as needed during seasonal depression and 40mg propranolol for performance anxiety when I need to perform. Its a lot of drugs but its really just the lithium at the core of it. Thoughts? ,Bipolar
46391,46384,Will You Take Medications For The Rest of Your Life? Its been 2 years since I was hospitalized for a manicpsychotic episode where I was diagnosed with bipolar. Over the course of 5 months posthospitalization I tried a myriad of medical concoctions including lithium abilify latuda and many others whose name Ive since forgotten. Whether due to the depressive episode that came directly after my manic one or the terrible side effects I decided I would go off medications.So now its been 19 months since Ive taken any medications. Ive avoided drugs alcohol and other stressors. I make sure to sleep 810 hours a day eat healthy drink lots of water workout meditate etc. and it seems like Ive been stable. I still get occasional periods of depression which I easily ride out or bursts of hypomania which makes life easier however all delusionsserious effects have all but disappeared.I recognize however that can be an illusion and at any point things can spin outside of my control. So recently I got a pdoc to write a prescription for Latuda however I havent picked up the medication yet because Im starting to question whether I should get back on it.This is primarily because I feel like the effects of longterm medication use can have irreversible consequences on the brain. It doesnt help that we have had 0 longitudinal studies showing the effects of staying on these medications for 20 years if there are I'd love to see them!. So given that Im currently stable I am having a hard time convincing myself to start taking medications indefinitely. I understand some people cannot function without their medication however Im lucky to not be part of that cohort for now.Anyways Im not advocating that anyone stop taking medications but I am curious how others view this topic do you intend on sticking with medications for the rest of your life?,Bipolar

50403,50548,Is stability supposed to be difficult? Hi I think 3 months ago I came here to ask you what being stable was like and if what I was feeling could actually be tagged as such. Only one person answered but he was saying exactly what I was feeling.Now I'm here I've been drowning in anxiety the meds I used only for emergency are now fixed. With a double dose. And I'm like????? What is going on? Yes. I got better Depakene really did wonders but I don't know how to deal with this under my skin crawling feeling that there is a storm inside that I can't let out because it's blocked. My mom said I'm a healthy woman why do I even need therapy for? When I'm like this seriously? Is this just anxiety? Am I into a hypomanic episode and don't know because I'm supposed to be stable? I have no clue. I'm tired. I fought for years to find meds who'd shut bipolar up and now that I have it does not look any easier. Sorry for the rant. I'm just tired.,Bipolar

I'm not necessarily afraid of failure but it seems like that's all that can happen to me. It's getting really hard to keep going when all I'm ever met with is disappointment.I'm caught in this stranglehold the manic side of me sees all this potential and what I can be if I put my mind to it but I always fall short and that just further verifies what the depressed side of me feelsthat I'm not worth much of anything and I have no real way of making my life better.It leaves me with no motivation to even try to do better because it's always ended the same way.I feel like I'm running out of time to get my life in order and I don't even really have a clue what to do with my life.I've been trying to just take the bad with the good but I just keep wondering when the good is going to come and it just makes me so damn disappointed with myself.Nobody has to reply or anything I think I just wanted to write all this down somewhere to try and get me to stop ruminating over my life,Bipolar

47084,47072,career advice I'm wondering if someone can give some academic advice. I currently go to a Top 30 University US news however my GPA has suffered tremendously due to my condition. I have appealed to my Dean of undergraduate school of education and he along with a committee have agreed to drop 1 semester from my transcript. Although appreciative I feel as though this is not adequate enough as I requested 3 semesters while hoping for at least 2. I come from an abusive and very poor background and I hoped that my personal life combined with my condition could gleam well upon me however that didn't happen. Now I want to appeal their decision and wondering how to do so. However I am also considering transferring to my local state institution. And here starts the problem. My local state school is much less prestigious than my current institution. However it may allow me a chance to start my GPA at zero. So my question is this is it more advantageous for job placement internships and grad school if I stay at my current prestigious institution and graduate with around a 2.8 or leave for a much lower caliber school and aim for a potentially a 3.5 GPA? Oh I am currently a SeniorIf you have any other questions please ask?Thank you,Bipolar

45711,45706,How to convince someone that I'll be okay? I've spent my entire life managing my ups and downs. I've figured out strategies for waiting out the lows and have handled it myself for as long as I can remember. It's made school difficult at times but I've done my best to keep my shit together and I'm in a graduate program that I absolutely love and working with people who are amazing. I know how to meet deadlines even in my worst episodes and I've learned how to harness the very rare hypomania for productivity. I accidentally confided in my supervisor and told him that I was dealing with a particularly bad bout of depression not my worst though. This spiralled into him being excessively worried about me and reaching out to other people and him phoningtexting me to check up on me. I've had moderate suicidal thoughts in past but I can usually handle them or I know to go to a doctor immediately if not. I was emotionally exhausted but doing okay before he started worrying about me. I'm afraid that his concern is pushing me deeper into this depressive episode though because he's made it feel more serious than usual. He was worried I was suicidal and that made me think about suicide more than usual and freak myself out about it. I ended up on the phone with him at 2AM crying because of it...The thing is I know it passes. I deal with it all the time. I know my worstcase measures and I'm prepared to use them. But the crucial thing is that I've always dealt with it myself. On one hand I get where he is coming from on the you shouldn't have to go through this alone thing but the fact that he's referring to me as a student in crisis makes me scared and makes me feel more fucked updepressed. I'm not sure how I can convince him that I'll be okay. I'm also worried that I've fucked up the only good thing in my life my academic stuff by confiding in him. I've resolved to take the steps he wants talking to X person checking in etc. to show that I'm committed to livingdealing with this shit and that I am accepting his help but it's so difficult when I just want to make an appointment with my psychiatrist and deal with this in my own way without everyone knowing. Also I feel like shit for making him worry and also for ruining his perception of me.Does anyone have any recommendations for quelling his worry and coming back from this gracefully?edit just fyi bipolar type II on bupropion and carbamazepine ,Bipolar

46953,46942,I was recently diagnosed with bipolar and it's making me question my own identity I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder three weeks ago. I am going through a major depressive episode and went to see a psychologist my mother recommended. My anxiety is slowly killing me and forcing everyone that I care about away from me. The meds aren't doing their job and I'm just really looking for some support and reassurance that I'm not all alone and absolutely insane.I prided myself in my abilities in the arts and my motivation and commitment when school started and always attributed my falling grades to the lack of motivation as the year dragged on. After being diagnosed I'm just not sure exactly of who I am anymore. I'm afraid people are going to look at all my past recent and future achievements with oh its due to mania but I feel like I need that validation to keep doing what I do. It has always been a way for me to express myself.My mom and grandma also have bipolar. My mom is extremely unstable and controlling and the only thing holding her back from completely grabbing my skin and stepping into it herself is the fact that I wasn't bipolar like her. Now that I am she has been forcing her past feelings of when she was young onto me. She's pushing onto me her experiences trying to relive her life through me and its making me question my own identity and whether or not I'll just end up like this nightmare that is my mother. My mother is also only taking me to her psychiatrist and doctors. I should trust them as they are reputable institutions in the area but I don't because of their affiliation with my mother. She is the only person I know who has this so I decided to make an account and find some people to help me go through this process.,Bipolar

46119,46113,Went on 2mg Abilify exactly 7 days ago as of today. I've gained 7 pounds. I am a 32 year old woman who was RX'd Abilify 2mg last week and began taking it a week ago today. I take it with 30mg lexapro which i've taken for several years with no weight gain at all.I am naturally very thin and always have been under weight. I have never had to worry about my weight...until now being on an AAP. I don't even own a scale and borrowed my roommate's today to find out my weight today and last week. The day I began the meds 7 days ago I was 117lbs and am now 124.5. I am still within the healthy benchmark for my height at 5'6. However given that it's only been a week and its 7 pounds that's a lot isn't it? I am excited to be a bit curvier and filled out but I worry about how unhealthy this rapid increase could be as diabetes runs in my family and I worry this medication will affect my health and metabolism negatively.This now is the ultimate incentive to exercise as i was infrequent and eat few caloriescarbs than before. I used to be someone who could eat anything and be rail thin. I'm hoping the effects of Abilify will out weigh the bad. I found that on day 5 of taking it which was this Monday was the first day I really felt like it was beginning to make me feel better. So far I find myself in a happier mood and my coworkers today told me I seem happier and asked me if something good or different happened. I didn't have an answer! I am now not scowling or irritable like I was. I am able to smile at people in my building now at work when I wasn't able to before.I'm curious to find out from other women what their weight gain has been like on Abilify. Were you able to control your weight eventually while still taking it? Or did you have to stop taking it in order to loose weight? Has anyone been able to loose weight after stopping it?,Bipolar

46892,46882,Lifeless mode advice appreciated Hi. I just want to say thank God for meds that have made me come down from manic episodes of sexapades and erarrtic behaviors of last few years ..adgitation running away etc. Bipolar meds help.I'm feeling good and stable now. This year has been fine. But I've just litterally been in my bed listening to talk radio on my phone smoking my vape pen hardly getting out . I'm not depressed. I went through a depression last year and got through that with the right medication and now I feel just a static of nothingness. I just don't do anything at all. I have no motivation to leave my room. It's weird. Not even shop or goto the beach listen to music. Has this happend to anyone ? How long does this funk last for? How can I get out of it? I turn on my music but I just turn it back off and want to crawl back in bed. I'm not at all sad. Just unmotivated to do anything but sit and lay around. It's the weirdest thing.

46191,46185,Happy New Year! Here's my Resolution I want to notice the times when I am alright. Really notice them stop to think hey my mood is okay right now I'm not anxious and I'm safe. Taking a moment to just feel my body and appreciate my surroundings. This has been so helpful to me lately. I'm climbing out of a small depression caused by a medication problem lithium level got a bit low while tapering off another med. I'm also kind of stressed out by some life stuff outside of my control it's not terrible more just annoying but I don't like it. I kind of have to realize something always comes up. There are no perfect stretches of time where work isn't stressful a social situation isn't stressful etc. But I have a roof over my head food in my pantry and love ones around me. I want to notice that it's okay right now.There are three times when a potentially bad thing can hurt you. You can get anxious before it happens if it happens. You can have it happen. And then you can ruminate and dwell on it. I know I can't always control what happens to me but I do want to get better at reducing anxiety and rumination. When I think back on events I want to tell myself a story that is neutral not one that makes it worse. I don't want to invent problems or spin existing problems out of control. It's hard but these two things are my mental health resolutions for 2019. I want to appreciate the good moments and I want to do my best to ensure that bad ones only hurt me once.Disclaimer I'm talking about my own anxiety and rumination over small problems this isn't meant to dismiss traumatic events that you will naturally feel a lot of anxiety around and ruminate about. Terrible and traumatic things happen. This is more about not spending the entire day worrying about something inconsequential. ,Bipolar

I also find it kinda hard to carry on a conversation with someone I dont know and making eye contact is a bitch for me makes me insecure and nervous but no disorders like down syndrome or ADD Just in general I'm not coping with life that well my last post I was coming off Lamotrigine which didnt seem to hell either. I also found my habit of smoking pot coming back rather strong actually as of now I know I'm addicted to marijuana sounds retarded I knowAnyway I'm taking 100mgs and still getting angry quite a bit I feel kinda numb sometimes like i cannot get angry or really think when I get angry I yell throw shit smash shit think about suicide and by the end of my fit I usually have bloody knuckles and borderline pulp of knuckles. What usually calms me down is just punching shit super hard til I realizemy body is in pain or if my dog has the balls to come up too me and chill me out I dont physically harm anyone or anything. What makes everything worse is that I have a new born so I cant really explode unless i go and smash the old fridge we have in the garage if I dont do that I look for something's I misplaced ruthlessly ripping apart my whole room and everywhere I might think I left it memory is shit now too I also pace back and forth like a mofo aggressively that doesnt seem to help only makes me think what else I can destroy.

I feel happy that I finally have a diagnosis that feels accurate I've been trying to figure out a diagnosis for about a year. I'm taking medication that I'm excited about I feel really happy that my psychiatrist and therapist both think this diagnosis is 100 accurate.I just also feel so lost like a part of me has been identified that has been ignored for so long. It's really strange to feel like no one has ever really questioned my behavior.

I've liked TWLOHA since I was in high school because of their dedication to preventing suicide and they were really connected to the music scene I was into but now as I'm older and diagnosed I'll listen to their podcasts and watch their social media and there's nothing that ever acknowledges bipolar. Just depression and anxiety. I feel like most organizations are this way. They support anxiety and depression because they're the trendy things to support while things like bipolar borderline and schizophrenia are still too scary and inappropriate to mention. I'd really like to see an organization that recognizes bipolar and supports more mental illnesses than just depression and anxiety. Anyone know of any good ones?

50202,50327,Psychiatrist belittling me First time poster on this sub but I feel like I need support. Sorry for the format I am on mobile. I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist but he doesn't seem to care.What really grinded my gears though was him saying well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6 I mean more like 2. To which I had to tell him that no I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. To which he asks me well how did that change over the course of time? It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster. I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time and I just want to be taken seriously. I see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed it's all in your head or that's just normal for a woman to be moody Have any of you ever had this happen on your journeys to getting help with your diagnosistreatments?

Amy was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety after a stressful life event. Amy knows about my diagnoses and we are very close so she has turned to me for questions and emotional support.

She is not making these comments from a place of ill intentions. I know mental illness is not a contest and mental health treatment is important for everyone.

I told her as much of my history as I could remember. Answered honestly all the questionnaires she handed me told her about my trip to the hospital even my recreational drug use. At the end she pretty much told me she didnt believe me. She asked that when I see her again to bring in a family member so she can verify my behavior in the past. I wouldnt mind that IF 1 I hadnt been on different medications for over 6 years 2 if I hadnt been diagnosed for over 4 years by 2 different doctors. She then took my regular prescription and said to take 13 of what I was taking and no mood stabilizer. I can see if she was suspicious if I came in looking for harder medication but she doesnt even prescribe any of that! I dont understand why she would completely invalidate my past history.

45900,45894,Unstable bipolar people giving people with bipolar a bad name. I've made forays into dating and I've encountered people who've had bad experiences with unstable bipolar people. Whether it's because of being unmedicated or a comorbid mental illness such as borderline these bipolar people have hurt others and left a bad impression of what people with the medical condition of bipolar are like. However maybe the impression is justified in the sense that almost all people with bipolar bring unnecessary drama to mentally healthy people? When I was unmedicated I know the mania caused trouble. And even medicated I still have some issues and understand that medication only lessens the frequency duration and severity of episodes and does not fully stop it.

Its a type of loneliness Ive never felt before its so bad it physically hurts. I cant find the words to explain the intensity of it. It hurts so bad. I can genuinely say I have only one friend and she lives halfway across the world. I live with my parents while I attend college. I have to take online classes so the only time I really leave my house is to go to a coffeeshop a couple days a week. I dont have a drivers license due to crippling anxiety Im working on getting it so even if I did have friends I wouldnt be able to see them often. So I have no one. No one to talk to besides my parents and thats just mostly superficial stuff.Im sorry if this is all over the place. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on what I could do to stop myself from slipping into full depression.,Bipolar

49653,49734,I'm spiraling out of control and being diagnosed with a deadly virus with a cure that costs 70k90k. I'm splitting on everyone I know and actively trying to make my situation worse that way I can't come back from it.. bipolar 2 BPD A week and a half ago I was diagnosed with hepatitis c. A deadly virus that costs about 7000090000 to cure. I work an entry level retail job and can't afford itThis diagnosis caused me to go from feeling on top of the world and stable to actively wanting to die feeling that nobody wants me around or loves me and splitting on everyone around me. Today I told the people I'm close to that I'm suicidal and then I blocked them all. I don't want relationships anymore. I always let people down and I don't feel like anybody needs me. I genuinely don't want to be close to anyone again because either I get let down or I let them down or I push them away. It's only going to be a matter of time before I am fired from my job and I'm homeless. I don't have any food as I don't have a car or a way to get it and I'm miserable. I've been writing letters if you get what I'm saying. And I've been planning things out in my head..I feel like this isn't something I can pull myself out of. Even if I did manage to start feeling better I'd still me an unwanted outcast with a deadly contagious virus. I hate myself I hate my life.,Bipolar
46078,46072,My therapist thinks I may be bipolar. So I just saw a new therapist and I was describing the symptoms I experience. Back when I wasn't on medications I used to have huge highs and devastating lows. During my highs I was more confident than usual my mood was highly elevated I was more energetic and I would be excessively talkative. Every time that happened though I would experience a crash. I would become desperately depressed with suicidal ideation worthlessness etc. With each crash worse than the last. This cycle probably occurred 20 times in a span of about a year. After telling him this he said that it sounds a lot like bipolar. He's a therapist not a doctor so obviously no diagnosis. My doctor put me on Latuda along with my Zoloft and Wellbutrin. One thing I noticed about my high periods is that sometimes I would get a little giddy in the day prior to the high. I also noticed that I still needed a full night's sleep. I just sleep more when in a depression. I've wanted to stop my Zoloft because my depression persists when I'm on it and I really miss the highs I used to have. ,Bipolar

49751,49838,Bipolar and Grieving Soon after discovering Im bipolar I realized that it clearly affects the way I grieve. Throughout the year I was 2324 I lost 12 people I was close to in a wide variety of ways it was too much for my brain so I just didnt process it. I didnt feel like I had the time. At 26 I lost a cousin who I had greatly looked up to and I still wasnt processing so I started therapy which helped me move on from the then 13 deaths. This was also prior to medication. At this time I am now medicated and Im grieving a brother a grandmother and an aunt who all died of separate causes though two died on the same night. All in the span of February. Its again too much for my brain. Way too much. Like in the universe of shitty fuckery I have dealt with which is a lot this really takes the cake. My brain is bouncing all over. From sobbing with utter despair and literally being unable to pick myself up off the floor to being so manic that I want to tear my hair out and break everything around me so instead I manic clean to just existing. I havent even been able to return to work and its almost April. I raised my brother and I feel like I didnt just lose a brother. I lost a son and a friend. Every stage of grieving just feels pointless. Its too much. I dont know what to do,Bipolar

Sometimes I feel at the top of the world and splurge on very useless things and spend a lot of my money other days I feel the exact opposite and just want to curl up and stay in my room all night.

50220,50346,Paradoxical cycle of my past present and future and suicidal ideation Hi guys So I am a bipolar and I haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. Anyway I believe being a bipolar affects the way I am thinking and the decisions I make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.So my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger this depressive episode is the WORST so far I live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments I am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because I miss these moments so much and miss the people that I don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that I couldn't really do anything about it my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore sometimes I used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. Thinking about what I could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me it just converts me from a happy person to a sad desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation mostly to overdose to death but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. I can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well sometimes I just get the good parts of the memories while other times I just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university losing my best friend losing my boyfriend ...etc. I just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. It just feels like getting stabbed in the back.These many emotions and mixedup thoughts I get give me a headache and usually panic attacks that sometimes I cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.I also have ADHD social phobia and severe trust issues. I now feel so bad that I wish this world to stop and my life ends. Thinking about suicide already makes me more comfortable to end my struggle you know. So I've been asking if I am alone on this. Does anyone relate to my experience?,Bipolar
50168,50288,Withdrawing off of Lamotragine Hello...this is my first post here and I hope it's okay. I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder in 2017 and took lamotragine since then was at 150 MG twice daily my life changed for the better. Well last year things got rocky and I didn't have transportation to a physician so I cut the dose in half to make the medicication last me..I took it that way for a year. WELL now I am completely out and my mood is swinging like a tetherball...I lost my health insurance a couple of months ago as well so now I just need to know coping methods that have worked for any of you that had to go unmedicated.

47007,46996,Doing very well but I feel guilty about recent events. Any advice? Hi everyoneSo I've been kicking life in the butt recently and I'm doing really well at work. I'm so proud of myself and I know that I have the energy to keep going and even push bad thoughts away.To put the situation into context when I was first diagnosed with BPD I took a lot of time off work sick. I then decided to leave and help myself get better. I rejoined my job back in Feb and I think I surprised myself in thriving when I went back.So I work in a call centre and if you know what its like working in one you'll know that diseases and sickness are a minefield. On Sunday night I came down with really bad flu and took Monday off. My team leader was fine with it as they know that this is something that's going round and tbf I sounded awful on the phone. I've also decided to take today off too as I'm not feeling much better. I guess I'm feeling pretty guilty about it because I've never had an absence from work since I went back. I'm feeling a little paranoid and worried that my TL might think I'm slipping back into old bad habits of staying of work. I know this is pretty trivial but it means a lot to me that I've improved so much.Just wondering if anyone had any advice about feeling a little less guilty about it?,Bipolar

46970,46959,Changing meds is never easy Since Ive been stable I am weaning off klonopin. Ive done it before and its not the most fun thing but tolerable.At the same time Im starting vyvanse for binge eating. I was already doing weight watchers and since September Ive lost 21 lbs but Ive got about 70 more to go this is a result of an episode that was triggered by going through a lot of life changes in a short period of time. The weight has caused me to have severe social anxiety. My doctor has known me since before I gained the weight and knows what a struggle its been. She knows this weight is not normal for me but as a result of the selfmedicating with food. I see her again in a week or so since medications are changing.The vyvanse is helping so much regarding I was always sleeping during the day on weekends I never had any energy plus Im not binge eating as often. But Im getting emotional again. My main symptom isnt panic but is crying. I cry and cry when Im unstable. Its creeping up on me. Im afraid if I tell my doctor she will stop the vyvanse and its helping me so much. But I also know how important it is to be honest with your doctor. There is no point to this other than to share my struggle among others who will understand. ,Bipolar
46099,46093,Brief Mention of Self Harm How can I help my friend? I apologize if I am posting this in the wrong place please let me know and Ill move it!Ive had a friend M for quite a few years that suffers from bipolar disorder. M didnt tell me about it until a good couple years into the friendship they were in the midst of an episode and I not knowing what was really going on regrettably lashed out because I didnt understand why they had been constantly upset and irritable with me. After that we had a much better understanding and M did a great job of redirecting their anger so I wasnt getting the brunt of it. However theyve been under quite a bit of stress lately and although they are not usually directly lashing out at me theyve taken an emotional turn for the worse. M seems to be in a constant state of negativity always turning every small difference of opinion into an argument and going on angry rants about it. It feels like every time I talk about anything they always have a negative rebuttal. Theyve become very reclusive so we hardly ever go out anymore if I suggest events or concerts or outings they dont want to go and can only think about why itd be a bad time. If something goes wrong their nightmood is ruined for example if they didnt want pickles on their sandwich and got pickles rather than take them off M just throws it away doesnt eat and remains livid about the fact they didnt get to eat and eventually leaves for home early because theyre so upset. Our friend group usually gathers at my place so at this point its like Im trying to tip toe around broken glass in my own home lest I say something to upset them. Lastly the most worrisome thing to me is that they will sometimes joke about how they got so angry they punched their armlegbedroom walletc. and the damage is visible. They are currently on medication from what Ive witnessed mostly just helps more with the mania and see a psychiatrist pretty regularly but they dont see a therapist though theyve admitted they could probably benefit from one. I want to be a better friend to them but I myself struggle with depression and it makes that difficult at times. I guess Im asking for advice because I dont know how to approach a conversation about this behavior. My worst fear is that M will misunderstand my intentions. They are my best friend and Id do anything for them but the friendship is starting to take a mental toll on me as well. ,Bipolar

46660,46651,I'm back here. I keep thinking I'm not bipolar and then going well I can see it. And I wish there was more info on irritabledysphoric hypomania. Although I did have tactile hallucinations at some point but I'm nots ure what was going on at that time. I've noticed a pattern for years but idk. Didn't think that could be it since itit's supposed to be uncommon at least compared to other disorders and I dont know of any family history though I've wondered about my bio grandfather. He was abusive angry and I guess he did drugs. I think my grandma said he used to be really smart and charming but he was lazy. Idk. Anyway no one talks to him and he won't help anyway.ampx200BI don't feel like typing out a history right now so maybe I'll edit later but for now theres my post history.ampx200BI sometimes wonder but then chalk it up to stress and insomnia and midterms and some sort of atypical depressionmood disorder but nah not bipolar. And now here I am thinking fuc. I was probably right ten years ago. I'd stopped thinking it was a possibility and then found out in 2016 that I had a cyclothymia diagnosis. I think at that time I had never been fully honest about how bad my depression could be because I was scared to tell her. Even after several years I guess. But it's not like shes a therapist.Anyway I seem to get angrier less patient sleep less though my energy isn't necessarily up spend more money used to be on food and stuff but it wasnt bad until last year and maybe this year sometimes talk more. Maybe even lower tolerance for boredom than usual.ampx200BI guess I've been angier lately. I got in a fight with my parents Tuesday night and ended up tearing my curtain rod from the wall somehow. I think I probably grabbed the curtain. I also punched the wall a bit but no damage. My friend had to pick me up from my house. I'm back home now but. Theres so much context really.,Bipolar

I have anxiety and fears that I've never experienced. Fear of death etc. You know what my psych told me? These aren't things common with latuda. He told me that I need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea. All of my symptoms point towards that instead of mental illness. What the hell!

Anyway i have it so bad that its a struggle for me to even be apart when he goes to work. I do a good job managing it and he doesnt really know i dont think.

So now i'm stuck trying to piece together how im going to manage him being gone for SEVEN WHOLE DAYS. This trip isnt even until the end of october and I'm already having anxiety attacks over it. I cant tell him not to go i cant be that person who says no you cant visit your mom but i will be a total mess for his entire away time and i know it. I literally cant handle it. I dont know what to do. How am i to handle this? Does anyone else have terrible seperation anxiety? How do you manage it? I am at my wits end over this and he hasnt even bought the plane ticket yet.

Spent my entire freshman year hypomanic finished with a 3.96 gpa. Had a full blown manic episode last semester when I finally got diagnosed and gpa dropped a ton. Depression this semester has set me to make my gpa fall a lot more.I have such high expectations for myself based based on how well I used to do in school and I feel like I owe it to my parents to also do well. They arent super strict or anything but my brother was also BP and had a paranoid violent manic episode which ended in suicide. Sister too although shes relatively stable now but without a job.

45851,45845,Meltdowns at work and ruining relationships advice? Ive been struggling with bipolar and Ive tried so many different meds none has worked for me. In the past 2 years I had 2 ectopic pregnancies which triggered a meltdown that required me to transfer to a different location. Then I had a meltdown in November because Im so exhausted with my current job. Its customer service and sometimes I have to handle picky clients. Started taking just klonipin to help my nerves. Ended up causing a huge fight because I took too many and felt like I could stick up for myself for once. Broke up with my boyfriend. Ended up getting back together. Things havent been the same since. Long story short I recently found out that during that time we broke up he added was talking or trying to talk to girls on social media. Im normally not the person to go through peoples phones but I had a really weird feeling by the way he was acting. Im overly jealous. Its a flaw. Which caused another meltdown. Well i really cant control my moods at this point. Ive been crying at work 247 recently. How embarrassing. I started partying too much again. Black out drinking klonopin weed I cant sleep at night. Its the only temporary fix that makes me happy for a moment. I did stupid shit Im too embarrassed to even say the past couple weekends at parties. I feel super guilty too. I tried killing my self either last weekend or the weekend before. I cant even remember because Im too mentally drained. I cant get these thoughts out of my head. I feel guilty and I hate myself. I dont feel bad for myself at all. I think Im a disgusting human being and really dont care about life anymore. I would call off but if you get so many points you get fired plus I really like the people I work with for the most part and dont want to leave them hanging. So ANYWAYS after that nice short summary I dont feel mentally stable to go to work for the rest of the week and I have a mandatory 8 hour meeting tomorrow. Honestly I dont even think its worth going good to because I want to quit. I dont have a back up plan set in stone and i dont even care anymore. Im that done. I want to move far away and start over from scratch or Im probably going to kill myself sometime soon. Rant over! Sorry for how long it was. Im desperate at this point. Im embarrassed to talk to anyone and be honest about my condition and how I havent taken any meds.,Bipolar
46185,46179,2019 resolution be S.T.A.B.L.E. Hey friends! We made it through another year. Im really proud of us. Ive officially made it past the one year mark of my major manic episode post diagnosis. 2018 was really hard as I was in a depressive episode and had to work through medication and side effects for the first six months. I started a new job in September and started taking improv classes in May. Things are finally at a relatively calm placefor the first time since my husband and I got married in 205 it looks like we might have a nice quiet year without any major life changes that happened to me in prediagnosis manic episodesWe know that stability is never guaranteed. My goal this year is to do everything in my power to stay stable and be able to steer through an episode ifwhen one comes up. So what does stable mean to me?S Sleep. 810 hours one hour without electronics in bed by 1030 out of bed by 730 T Therapy. Going to personal and couples therapy meditation journaling being kind to myself through self talk. A Activity. Working out consistently more walking and biking as transport being outside moreB Balance. Work vs life alone vs social self care vs being productive comfort vs growthL Learning less tv more books and hobbies. More improv!E Eat healthy drink water take meds and vitaminsIts a tall order. Im probably not going to be able do to all the things all the time but its easy for me to remember and my ultimate goal is to be healthy. What about you?,Bipolar
46672,46663,Where I end and bipolar begins passion? I'm not sure when I began having bipolar symptoms. But for most of my life I've been very cyclic. I don't think I was stable for most of my adolescence. It is very scary for me to look back on my life. And think of how most of the times I really felt like MYSELF were when I was most likely manic. I used to be very goaloriented loved to learn passionate about my hobbies. Just passionate passionate passionate.But not always. I would slip into depressive phases and either lose interest in things or stop entirely.When I think of myself I think of someone is incredibly passionate. But that doesnt describe me at all. I feel like a husk who used to be someone. I still like the same things. But I never learn or do anything anymore.I used to write essays for fun. I used to practice Japanese religiously. I used to be so passionate. The scary thing is. I think my passion and vigor was never me. It was mania.I'm scared that I was never anything but manic or depressed. I'm scared that's all I'll be. Or a husk.The only moments where I feel like myself are when I'm passionate and working hard. But I haven't felt a single flicker of that passion since I had my manic episode. I just feel blank. Sometimes depressed. Sometimes stable. Mostly bored. And I'm scared to feel passion sometimes. Because then...its mania. It must be mania. I dont know how to separate who I am from bipolar disorder. Is the me that I appreciate just my manic self? Is this passionless semidepressed stay at home jobless college drop out...ME?TLDR My identity is being passionate being hardworking a love of learning. I'm scared the past me was just manic and that I will never have that kind of passion again unless manic. What separates ME from bipolar? I am currently a husk of my old self.,Bipolar
49502,49577,Being bi polar and no one understands you I was diagnosed 6 years ago with type 2 bi polar disorder and my God what a fucking battle it has been from being on various medications at first to being onoff with meds to being stable on meds and now eventually being off my meds.Having this disorder is just too indescribable and majority of the people I've come across don't understand it especially those close to me which is pretty fucked up. The constant questions of what's wrong with you to why are you like thisWhen I try to explain to my family members that I have a disorder they turn around and say don't speak that over your life. Like tf? They quite religiousHalf the time I have no reason to feel how I feel and I control my impulses my moods and my outbursts to seem normal to the world but its soooooo draining to feel like one day you on top of the world and life is great and then the next few days you feel like a piece of shit who doesn't deserve anything good. I guess thats just joys of not being on meds but even being on meds I still had to control it there was better periods of stability but there was moments of is this shit working?The episodes that come whether depressive or manic unfortunately it seems as if my family doesn't believe it and it's all in my head...excuse the pun there but its really fucked up. Having this disorder has messed with my life in ways I couldn't imagine and in the past I didn't know its coz I'm mentally ill I just thought this is me being normal until I was diagnosed everything made sense as to why I am the way I am. My habits and my patterns my way of thinking.I've lost out on so much I've been through so much and the funny part is I have nothing to show for it like it's been a wasted life. People came into my life and left me after they get to know me the rest of my family doesn't get it some of my friends claim they get it but their behavior states otherwise.I'm always in a place of I don't know and I keep living in my head and it really fucking sucks coz it feels like I can't find myself or my place in this world and all I can sit here and say is I wish I wasn't bi polar.,Bipolar
49887,49982,You own it Possible controversial post here but I speak from my own experience. I've finally come out of the depths of the darkest longest depression I've experienced. It took perseverance self advocacy accountability and surrendering when it was too difficult to cope. Oh and tons of therapy. From all of this I've learned that I own my own happiness. No one else is responsible for it because they've got their own to worry about. It's my body and I also own the right to know what works best for it. Meds eating the foods that make me feel my best moving my body journaling my thoughts. All these steps pay off. It. Just. Takes. Time.

46824,46814,Thismay sound batshit but I think my night vision got shittier to prevent hallucinations? So I'm bipolar 1. When I was a teen I used to habitually hallucinate at night seeing shadows as things they weren't picture things lurking in corners hear things etc. It kept me up for hours with lights on hoping the images wouldn't become more vivid or real feeling. Most times they didn't. Sometimes they did.Ever since I started getting medicated though my night vision has devolved into shit. I physically cannot see in the dark no matter what not without a source of definitive light. While medication severely lessened hallucinations it didn't rid me of them. I still fairly often hear things that aren't there. But night hallucinations? The inability to see has made them nigh impossible. Is it possible my brain decided to rewire itself a bit to make my life easier? I mean it's done that before when I grew to be more introverted and selfsustainable socially or reconditioned my conscious brain to want and need more sleep. If so hecking wild. If not a convenient coincidence. Nighttime hallucinations always really fucked me up but it's hard to create any visions out of the pitch black. Anybody else experience weird stuff like this body adapting in weird ways to cope with disorder?,Bipolar

She came out of the hospital and was better after having our second child and was fine for years but now I see the symptoms coming back. I've looked all over the net and cannot find a decent resource on how to handle it outside of shoving pills down her throat. She doesn't think she has an issue but I can see it from past experiences.

I got fired from my one job after being in the hospital. I'm failing half of my classes at college. I feel like because of my bipolar I'm just not made to be successful in life. I haven't been stable since early highschool. I'm so tired of rapid cycling and my moods shifting so fucking fast. I always used to say that I didn't want to live past 22 but that was even before my diagnosis. I can only see my life becoming more hopeless and I feel bad for my partner of almost a year that puts up with my bullshit. My mom says I wallow in self pity a lot and there's people worse off than me but how is that supposed to help me? I don't want to end up being on disability for the rest of my life I don't want to drop out of school because of this fucking disorder. But it just doesn't seem to end. ,Bipolar
45533,45529,Meds or anxiety?? SOS Hi friends. Ive been experiencing muscle tension and spazzing in my legs that shoots throughout my whole body over and over again. It gets stronger as the attack goes on for sometimes hours and then just disappears out of no where. Im wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what it may be from? Im prescribed Latuda benztropine trazodone and propanoral spelling may not be right in some of those Please help! These attacks make me feel like I could murder myself and everyone around me. They make me feel like theres no reason to live like this. Im not sure if the episodes are anxiety inflicted or a horrible side effect from the meds. ,Bipolar

So I've been to a lawyer who stated that because I have nothing and make so little I am judgement proof can be sued but to no avail.

My wife left us a year ago and I haven't even had the time to deal with that shit. My daughter constantly needs me to be there for her but half the time I just want to pull the covers over my head and hide. I don't get enough sleep and I'm always fearful I'm going to enter into manic mode. I feel like a failure as a dad for having the constant changes in mood that come with bipolar. I take meds now so I am much more stable than I used to be but it's not perfect. I'm lucky that my mother lives nearby and she helps out. I'm just curious if there are any other bipolar parents out there.,Bipolar

I'm transitioning from lithiumwellbutrin therapy to hopefully just standalone lamotrigine. The wellbutrin seemed to lose it's effectiveness after taking it for a few years and the lithium wasn't enough to prevent depressive symptoms. I'm starting to feel better regardless of medications and have been taking 25mg lamotrigine for a week now. It's unfortunate it takes so long to get up to a therapeutic dose on this medication but I know it's worth it to be patient.I'm just curious when I'll be able to expect the lamotrigine to start affecting my mood vs therapy diet exercise time outside and all the other things I'm doing to get better.,Bipolar
47095,47083,Lamictal withdrawal severity change over time? Hi so three times in the past week and a half Ive missed my Lamictal dose. Last Wednesday and Thursday night I threw up all my meds because of Latuda nausea. Last night I forgot to pick up my Lamictal refill from the pharmacy so went without it.Normally I cant go more than four hours past taking my nightly Lamictal dose of 400 mg without horrible and intense withdrawal. It puts me in a severe mixed episode with suicidal ideation and planning. Every time I throw up my meds or miss a dose I prepare for some of the worse hours of my life until I can take my dose again.Ive been on it since 2006 and have been at this high dose for probably at least 8 years. The weird thing is... none of the withdrawal symptoms happened these last three times. Maybe Im just numbed our from my other meds Latuda 120 mg Seroquel XR 300 mg Lithium 1200 mg. Or could this be a sign that its not even working in my system anymore so I wouldnt miss it? Anyone know if those other drugs lower Lamictal doses? This is such a jarring change that I wonder if it has larger implications.Thanks!,Bipolar

46123,46117,Have you ended a relationship while manic and later regretted it? My now ex fiance isn't diagnosed as bipolar so I may be completely off. In fact it never occurred to me to think that our relationship which would be going so well for months and the would have a sudden two week period of intensely angry fights was the result of bipolar disorder. We had broken up about 4 times in 3 years always for just a few days but this time I was tired of fighting his moods. On our last day together while doing a last sweep after packing up our apartment he casually mentioned that his mum is manic. He had never told me that before.I was really caught off guard by the breakup we had just gone to a romantic dinner the night before and his temper seemed out of nowhere so after giving him a few days to 'cool off' tried to fix it and that's when I found out about his new girlfriend. He was screwing her in the bed that We were still sharing at night Awful.Since we split I found out he's cycled through that girlfriend and now has 3 casual ones. He's bought a car a new computer 2 TVs. This despite being really tight on money generally and having a bunch of new expenses since we're not splitting them anymore I can't think of how he could possibly be affording this besides maxing out credit cards. He's deleted all his social media sent angry ranting texts to his friends cutting off their friendship. Right before the breakup he applied for a bunch of jobs in exotic places he's normally sort of boring about where he'll go and was coming up with two totally separate outofnowhere plans to start businesses in fields he's not skilled in. Now I'm wondering if he could be undiagnosed bipolar. It might explain the sudden promiscuity reckless spending maybe even the bursts of anger out of nowhere We're in our mid 30s so it would be late to be diagnosed.Now that I have this thought in my head I'm obsessed with the idea that maybe he is sick rather than cruel and that he might come down from his mania and want to reconcile. I could forgive everything with a genuine apology and obviously a promise to seek treatment. It's been about 3 months since we broke it off. We split our stuff moved to seperate places and after getting sick of getting angry texts out of he blue I blocked his number. I'm not going to contact him he'd have to come to me. I guess I'm not looking for redditers to armchair diagnose but wondering do people who dump someone during a manic spell come to regret it when they've come down? I'm wondering if my hope for reconciliation is actually plausible or if Im just grasping at straws?,Bipolar
45996,45990,Starting to doubt I have bipolar? I'm a 26 year old woman. I was going through a really rough patch considering suicide etc. So I booked an appointment with a doctor. The doctor referred me to another doctor who discussed the possibility of having bipolar. At the time it made sense I could see how I fit many of the symptoms. In order to get a proper diagnosis I need to first speak w a psychiatrist. I have an appointment this Thursday. I'm now starting to seriously doubt that I have bipolar. I'm no longer feeling so down i actually feel fine. I'm starting to question whether I have bipolar or if I'm just being a little dramatic? Doesn't everyone do wild stuff now and again? My friends all have crazy stories of wild shit they've done. All similar to mine. And normal people feel down sometimes too. Right??I'm dreading going to this appointment on Thursday because I'm embarrassed to explain that there's nothing wrong with me I'm just dramatic and a bit of a cry baby. What should I do? Should I cancel or go and just apologise for wasting this doctors time?? Or could this all be in my head??? Help lol ,Bipolar

This is compounded by my being proactive into March until I had two breakdowns weeks ago and sleeping off my problems might be a possible coping method.Much of this has had me recall my first year of high school where I was deeply depressed and often slept during and after school whereas I was highly energetic and consistently worked in my junior and senior years.Does anyone else here have similar experiences?,Bipolar
46578,46570,I am spiraling. Yesterday my panic attack lasted basically all day and today I've been waking up crying. Like the title says I feel like I'm losing the battle again. I'm on Lamictal but this weekend something triggered me and I've been failing to cope. Someone who I thought was my friend invited me to hang out and I had to drive quite a bit so it wasn't like a spur of the moment thing. Then my friend ditched me to hang out with someone else and left me with his friends who I had just met that night. I left in the morning I was staying over and they never came back. I did something kind of petty to get back at them and when I called to apologize they said they owed me a call but were out with their friend X right now so that made me feel even more like shit because apparently it's ok to ditch me but not step out for a phone call. I really cared about this person and it just sucks to be treated like I'm disposable. Normal me would have been able to handle things better but I smoked some A LOT of pot on Friday and it triggers my moods. I don't know how I'm going to get over this because my chemicals seem to be all out of whack. I just feel like life is a freaking rollercoaster of crap and I don't think I have the strength anymore. I just want to stay in bed for the rest of my life. I've also been single for a LONG time and it's because I've been unmedicated for most of my life until recently but I still have moments of crazy. Who out there could even deal with this shit? I am so alone. ,Bipolar

46287,46281,A minor adjustment to my meds. So Ive been really lucky with meds and lifestyle changes being really successful for me. I have bipolar 2 and anxiety Ive been pretty much stable with little dips into mild depression for awhile. I was only taking gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. Gabapentin was the first mood stabilizer I ever tried and its always kept my hypomania at bay and my anxiety dialed down a little. Hydroxyzine comes in for sleep and breakthrough anxiety. It works. Im productive and mostly good. But the little dips into mild depression started to string together and I feared I might go into a deep depressive episode so I just told my doctor I want to add an SSRI. Were trying Celexa right now. So I took it last night she said some people prefer night some morning for the first time and couldnt sleep very well. So Im definitely going to switch to the morning from now on. I had a little stomach upset but not too bad. I slept less than I need to but I feel really good this morning. Im still on my gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. And will go back to take just the hydroxyzines at night so I go back to sleeping normally. BUT I dont know if its too soon to tell obviously its been like 12 hours but this morning I got up feeling really optimistic and happy to start my day. Maybe this is placebo effect although Im usually skeptical that things will work or maybe Im just super lucky with things working on the first try. I dont know. Just letting yall know that Im feeling optimistic and happy. I felt pretty good before but let my doctor know even though I was stable I was still struggling a little with depression and Im hopefully this addition works out. ,Bipolar
45809,45804,Experiences with Lithium? My doctor prescribed me lithium 300mg ER twice a day. I have been extremely reluctant to start the medicine because of the dumbest reason ever the notorious weight gain. I take care of myself pretty well with the exception of a few beers every other weekend or so definitely nowhere near drunk. I go to the gym 45 days a week and eat relatively healthy. I just recently lost a few pounds and am still trying to lose more personal preference I'm a healthy weight. I drink probably around 10 glasses of water a day. Does anyone have experience with weight gain on the med? I read online that part of it can be attributed to an increase in sugary drinks to accommodate the extreme thirst but I only drink water with a cup or two of coffeetea in the mix. I'm pretty nervous I know that the good outweighs the bad 10 fold but weight gain is not something that I would take well.,Bipolar

I can do little more than get up and take a shower every day but I'm trying as hard as I can and it seems like it's only making me feel shittier.

46147,46141,Rapid cycling is becoming increasingly unbearable So Im bipolar one with rapid cycling. I was diagnosed about a year ago.Lately I have felt so isolated and I think I did it but self. I go one day happy about my life. And that the rest of the week it takes all of my energy just to get out of my bed.I know this comes with the illness. And I know that Im going to be OK. But in the meantime Id really like to stop crying and feeling like my life doesnt matter. I feel very alone even when I am around other people.I dont know whats wrong with me anymore.I dont remember how I ended up like this.Im so frustrated because the last three years I had so many horrible things happen. Im trying to get myself under control.I take my medicine but it doesnt seem to work. I change it. That will work for a few weeks. Then I have to move on to something else. I dont take Xanax or Clonopin. Only because my doctor doesnt want me to become dependent on them. I dont know. I guess a lot of people become addicted. I dont have an addictive personality that Im aware of. But Vistaril doesnt work. I smoke a lot of pot and that helps but where Im from its not really something you can admit. And its something I can get arrested for but its also on of the few things that calm me down enough to be rational. I dont know how to make friends. I dont know how any one could put up with me. But I dont have anyone to talk to. I know I am being irrational. But right now everything feels real. What am I suppose to do? I just want it to go away. I feel like I am being ridiculous. How did this happen? I havent always been like this... anxious yes. Ive always been a nervous person. But I was brave. And now Im afraid of everyone and everything. Im not really looking for answers. I just needed to say it. I dont want to hate my life. I want to be better. I have to get better. This cant be the rest of my life. ,Bipolar
49697,49779,Can an SSRI make me depressed instead of manic? Is this possible? Before my diagnosis I was given Paxil and felt the most depressed I had ever been. From what I remember its been almost 2 years it felt like my head was very empty and dark. My girlfriend said recently she was walking on eggshells around me back then and felt like I was going to lose it at any second. I even want to say I remember having these two internal dialogues conflicting each other all the time. I was really unhappy and felt suicidal continuously as well. After giving the med 46 weeks to work I got switched to Effexor. I did a little better with this one but still felt suicidal and empty. Fast forward 2 years and now Im diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. I have been given a mood stabilizer that has done really well for me. The reason why I ask this is because I have this constant worry that Im misdiagnosed for some reason. I believe Im suffering from imposter syndrome. My psychiatrist seems very confident with his diagnosis. I also believe this post could help others who are suffering from anxiety like I was to find out it could be actually bipolar disorder. So can an SSRI make someone with BP depressed instead of manic?,Bipolar

46461,46454,Pauses in symptoms during hypomania Is it possible to experience a break in symptoms during hypomania? For example I may feel very tired from the lack of sleep for a few hours during the day feel ashamed of hypersexual symptoms or just feel like I've snapped back to my true selfcalmed down only for this fleeting break to end and be brought back up. I'm new to all this and am not yet wellversed enough on the illness or my own individual symptoms to be able to differentiate between a genuinely high mood with the normal mood fluctuations all people experience or being hypomanic. I'm using either zopiclone or ambien regularly for sleep at the moment so I don't know if the drowsiness is perhaps just a hangover from those. I'm also starting abilify though at a very low 2mg so far so unsure if that's potentially causing certain symptoms I'm having as well. I appreciate any insight from you all.,Bipolar

50319,50461,Something I wrote before I knew I was bipolar. I used to think it was a personality disorder instead of a mood disorder. Dear Journalwell I really dont know that much about you being dear thats clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal though I had been writing quite often on my phone journal. Either way dear beloved and most precious electronic journal I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Todays riveting topic. My day! As I dont think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial woodstuff? Perhaps I should find something as simple as it may besomething I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings my feelings nonetheless.How does anxiety feel? I know weve all been there. Any Escripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much but baring mental health professionals I dont think that those of us that enunciate the word anxiety with statisticaloutlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that of course is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess thats why we get diagnosed catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. Were a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.I have messy hair messy eyes my room is messy my thoughts are scattered and messy! I cant make a decision for the love of myself the short version I dont work. I mean that both literally and figuratively whatever that means! think about it! What does the verb to work mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But thats having a job we call it work because you do motions in a job but we call the motions work because work is the act of physical exertion right? I dont know this is literal garbage that Im talking right now talkingwriting garbage cant literally be literal I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish too long to get into this tangent. I cant hold a normal job I cant hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee and I felt like as if Ive murdered someone. I mean Ive never killed anyone and I hope I never do such a heinous thing but you know that feeling you get in your chin your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended but I dont feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didnt use to be like that. Emotions to me seem to work now like to a BPD patient perhaps I have BPD traits?. How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example angerin BPD afflicted individual anger2. Or perhaps its even a cubical function i.e. anger3 I dont even remember if cube is exponential 3. Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest youve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you because you cant love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die looking at places where you could hang yourself feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing imagining a knife to the throat thinking about swerving into traffic travelling and not feeling anything kissing someone youre deeply into and not feeling anything doubting everything you do every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs anxiety is depression anxiety is the antithesis of life of enjoyment of love and all thats good. This is anxiety as this is obviously a corrupted poisonous version of a feeling thats supposed to help us survive i.e. anxiety. Anxiety turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive. Do my friends love me? thats what Im stressing about as I type this.,Bipolar

Around this time I felt myself coming loose and the depression was coming over me. My anxiety began to grow to the point where i felt like the ground was shaking below me all the time and the walls were creaking. I got an intense ptsd flashback where I acted out. There were some nights were i was SURE that all the cameras were watching me and people in photos or paintings were spying on me. This would be around the time work would get complicated and I would need to leave but for the first time ever I pushed myself through it and made it! My raise was 50 but it really does add up to a lot. I also got a store key so I can close on my own now! This is probably not a big deal but this is the first time ever for meIve been working there for about 2 months now. It doesnt seem like much but this is the longest time Ive kept a job in a while.

I figured out over 10 years ago that I'm bipolar runs in the fam but wasn't officially diagnosed until 2015.I have so many different types of mania that it's extremely hard for my husband to know when I'm manic vs just 'me'. We're coming up on 12 years together but he still doesn't know how often I am manic and which version of myself I am most of the time. My most obvious mania episodes involve an excessive amount of energy hyperactivity very fast talking increased sex drive etc. However I have a vast amount of different 'types' of manic episodes.I tried to explain to my husband that 75 of the time I'm in an episode but they don't look the same. He thinks I'm trying to use my bipolar disorder as an excuse. I was only trying to explain some of my symptoms. Does anyone know how to tell loved ones about all the different forms of mania in a simple to understand way?,Bipolar

I didn't want to not take them so I took them not knowing if it would be a double dose or not.ampx200BWhen I woke up this morning I realized that yes it was a double dose.

45566,45562,Getting bf committed How realistic is this? He's been unmedicated for 2 years and promised a month ago he'd get medicated because I said I won't stay if he doesn't it's been bad.He is currently out of work for going on 8mos and obviously also uninsured. He went to a psych on his sister's bill about 5mos ago was prescribed Abilify did not like the initial side effects so refuses to take it. I can't afford to send him to a new pdoc and a lot of his family is not speaking to him rn because along with losing his job her burned most of his bridges.How realistic is it that we could get him committed and maybe get a new prescription that way? Is this a horrible idea? Will it make him worse? I have not proposed it yet but his counselor did about a month ago. Please help wonderful people of this amazing community. EDIT not wanting to commit him involuntarily. I just want to understand how hospitals or inpatient treatment centers work in situations like this. How does one get medshelp with limited funds is probably more the question. I'm sorry for being such a noob.,Bipolar

46936,46925,My experience with tramadol This past week I was prescribed 8 tablets of tramadol for an unrelated posttreatment painkiller and I felt completely different. Its hard to explain but basically even during arguments and other stressful situations that unsettle me I was able to stay calm and focused. I felt enough of the anger emotion that I knew I was angry but my brain was calm enough to accept the anger and be passive while yet acknowledging it. I was also productive and in great spirits which seems to be the norm on this opioid.Ive never been diagnosed and Ive always lied on depression quizzes at the hospital but the truth is a couple weeks ago it hit me that my mood swings and depression might not be normal.I realized that sometimes I am completely happy and good to the point of being TOO happy. I will often hyperorganize my house deep clean or workout every single day... basically checked off every symptom of a mania. During these times I paintwrite exercise I eat and cook hell I even tackle projects outside and have a hard time falling asleep for being too excited with my projects. Ive also had bad instances with alcohol during these times from a feeling of cockiness and recklessness where I have acted out in ways I am ashamed of.As for the depression it comes on as low and long as it can be. I sleep on the couch during the day lose weight and am constantly weepy or angry. I do not like to work on anything much less have the energy to deep clean or create. These mood swings as Ive always called them come in bouts of weeks sometimes months and occasionally like I mentioned as a result of an argument or something else incredibly stupid. This is having a toll on my marriage and family and I am curious as to medications having any similar effect on me as tramadol which I read up on and completely agreed with the following In fact one of the reason people like taking Tramadol is because for some people it works as an antidepressant producing euphoria or energy unlike other opioids which tend to make people drowsy. This has led it being used recreationally while people still go to work or live their daily lives. blog.iodine.comI am obviously not going to get this prescription refilled and dont need the cautions because like I said I read up and completely understand the danger of taking opioids as anything other than a TEMPORARY strong painkiller.TLDR Im 24f hesitant to take the first step in getting diagnosed or treated for what I suspect is Bipolar 1 Disorder. Had a good experience with an unrelated painkiller and would like to hear from people who selfdiagnosed and are now on treatments or anyone who can relate to my experience. ,Bipolar

45816,45811,Bipolar II I just went through my third extreme manic phase ever Some background I was in and out of the ER in January four times within two weeks because of some undiagnosed pain I had mistaken for a ruptured appendix. I dont know if it was all the pain meds or weird sleep schedule or what but right after the last visit I was thrust into a manic phase I guess just a really major extended hypomania technically for the third time in my life. When I was young my bipolar II was misdiagnosed as depression because the hypomanic phases were not so pronounced and I was on Vyvanse for ADHD the same time as my antidepressants. It was about 3 weeks of minimal sleep maximum spending obnoxiousincoherent rants on social media questionable fashion choices etc. This morning I woke up and immediately could tell Im crashing. This is the hardest my depression has hit me in a really long time thanks to the contrast of the hypomania. I guess I just wanted to vent. I dont have a therapist anymore and my mom doesnt understand the depth of what manic phases are. She thinks its just not being tired and talking faster than usual.,Bipolar

Im teetering on the edge of a massive down at the moment while my pills even out just upped dosage and alongside the other crap I always get really bad problems with my hands and coordination. I feel like I cant close my hands properly as if all the heaviness goes into them and when I try to concentrate on them they just go shaky. My shrink says its a normal symptom of depression lack of coordination which is fine my problem is that Im a piano teacher and every time this happens it makes it almost impossible to demonstrate exercises for my students or convince them that good technique pays off. Not to mention I keep droppingbreaking things. Has anyone found a way to work around this? It doesnt help me to have proof that Im uselessbad at my jobclumsy when Im in a down and like I said Im definitely heading there this weekend.

45726,45721,Probably hypo after med change Here I am at 6 after an hour of staring at the ceiling and trying not to move too much after going to at 230 'cause I wasn't tired. This is all coming off the back of a month long depressive episode with a lot of suicidal contemplation which was finally ended by an increase in seroquel to 300mg an increase in lamictal to 100mg twice a day and a decrease in lithium over the last few months from 900mg a day to 300. I have felt fantastic the last 4 or so days but everyone around me is freaking out because I'm too hyper and loud and all over the place especially my gf who's going through a rough patch. I can't even sit still long enough to comfort her and it's really freaking her out. Of course the only other time I've been like this was right before I crashed and burned and went to the hospital for a week so bad feelings all around I guess. It just seems odd that this would come about after an increase in seroquel and lamictal. If it stays too much longer I might drop a note for the psychiatrist because I know this isn't sustainable it just feels so damn good.Is this common to switch like this after a med change? Also how the hell do I deal with all the people freaking out thinking this is going to wind up putting me in the psych ward again?Thanks ,Bipolar

46014,46008,My job has become too much. What do I do next? I work at a coffee housebar. I've been in there for almost five years. I've even been told I'm a crucial part of the team and promoted to assistant manager. I like certain parts of my job restocking getting everything in order before the end of my shift making drinks coffee amp booze flexible hours I work 34 days a week.For the longest time I also loved the company culture. They seemed to really care. And I love most of my coworkers and they've become close friends. But lately it seems like the company doesn't care at all and besides making me feel undervalued my day to day experience is also incredibly stressful. Management has made this job pretty toxic and I've been super depressed for months maybe I would've been otherwise but the focus of most of my depressive thoughts has been my shitty work environment.I'm feeling really ready to leave this job but I'm also terrified about what to do next.I don't really like dealing with people all day. I've gotten by this long at my job without losing my shit mostly by being the utility player and spending more effort keeping things running smoothly while other coworkers do more of the small talk that I find so emotionally taxing. But if I can avoid it I'd rather not go into another customer service job.I've considered so many different careers and I've gotten pretty enthralled with each idea for a time amp then talked myself out of every one. I've seriously considered nursing social work teaching and making toystheatrical puppetsart directing sort of deal. I just don't know what I can do that'll give me the time off I need to function while being fulfilling and not emotionally draining. Do you have any advice on selecting jobscareers? I'm just feeling so overwhelmed by the prospect of making these decisions but I don't feel like I have the luxury to put off these decisions any longer because this job has really gotten to the point of pushing me over the edge.,Bipolar

And I didn't talk to anyone about what I felt at any point.Now I'm home trying to put the peices of my life together. Trying to keep what I still have in one peice simultaneously.It's not really going well.My thoughts are too scattered to follow. My feelings are overwhelming and fleeting.I'm sick of being sick. But it turns out working to avoid it doesn't help anymore than any other thing I've read about or attempted.Meds lol. Which ones??I managed to become more successful without them than I have managed to maintain with them.At what point do life experiences and there impact get added into the equation of medacting someone.

46257,46251,Tardive Dyskinesia medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone Its hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent 13 I think but I have been bipolar since I was a young child and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now so still young but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first surprisingly fine and stable but now I have been manichypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before. I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment. Its just at my last appointment before the mania started we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication. I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again. I dont really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to dont get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with. Its like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child with consistent therapy with medication and with A LOT of everyday effort is going to be ripped out from under me and its not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. Its scary. Its a lot. Sorry this is so long. I hope there are still people willing to read it. ,Bipolar

Get a hammer and put holes in my walls and through the windshield of my car. I can't even set down to write a whole email. I'll type a few words then go and walk or spas out then come back and do it all again. I've gotten manic while driving before or felt it come on and one of the only things that helps at the time is to stick a knife in my leg. Not inside my leg but just putting the tip on my flesh and putting just enough pressure to focus on the pain instead of mania.I have an anxiety med that works to help Klonopin but taking my max dosage doesn't always help. my max is 4mg but I've taken up to 20mg before.

I felt great until a coworker made me feel like shit and that my progress meant nothingI have a coworker that is much older than me he frequently talks down to me in front of the entire team and has the attitude that his opinion is gospel no matter the circumstances. Im two years out of college with limited experience so I approached him about my frustration and how I can improve. He got very defensive and denied any part in this. Instead of talking it through with me he monologued about mental health and seeking a therapist to talk about my frustrations at work insteadI sat there and listened to him monologue trying to act like it was fine but damn did it hurt to be talked down to about my mental health. I never told anyone about my diagnosis medication or treatment.

Fast forward two years a couple of hospital visits and finally getting a full wrap around team I'm a lot more stable now that I'm on what I feel are the right set of meds for me atm been on a set of lithium lorazepram and buproprion for the past 3 months and it's worked amazingly. It's allowed me to work write and just generally focus like I used to without the mood swings and recognize when I'm becoming manic or depressed at high caliber level that I'm used to. I know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens but recently have had a string of events good bad and otherwise have caused my depression to come back in full swing. I recognize it for what it is and why I feel like this which is a huge step compared to before but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where I know just to tune it down. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system but I guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication I think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful. Because I'm really in a spot where Im really not sure how to approach it and could probably use some netflixmovie suggestions as I don't have much energy to do anything else. Thanks for reading and sorry if this is all over the place. ,Bipolar
45584,45580,Trying an alternative route to recovery in case meds don't work out I've been on a bit of a rollercoaster for the past couple of months being switched on and off various medications I posted in here a while back about going on quetiapine and immediately having to be taken off it because it gave me hallucinations and battling through referral systems to try and get therapy and a diagnosis. I've finally been referred to a neurologist and a psychiatrist but the psychiatry appointment isn't til May 31st my doc's pretty pissed off he'd requested it as an 'urgent appointment' UU so until then it's basically up to me to keep myself stable. i've started keeping a bullet journal where i can track my moods am using dbt self help books every day meditating every night have quit alcohol and this morning started at a yoga class i'm trying literally everything that mentallywell people have been telling me to do for years. do any of you have any lifestyle changesnatural remedies i haven't mentioned that work for you? i wish i could rely on meds and therapy to get me through but the healthcare system is so slowmoving in the UK that i feel i should have a backup plan and also it doesn't hurt to fill my life with things other than antidepressants sometimes. i don't wanna turn into one of those 'you don't need drugs nature is the real antidepressant' kinda people but if it turns out those people are correct then i'm frankly quite happy to be wrong if it means an easier way to recover lol. i hope all this makes sense i'm a rambly person when i'm not in a depressive phase,Bipolar
45993,45987,Medication Frustration Triiger warning mentions suicide and ED long I am new here 36 f and have commented some but this is my first post. I started a little over four years ago to try and find some relief from all the bad things going on in my mind. The only other time I had been to a Dr to help with my ongoing mental issues was when I was 22 and in college. A GP prescribed me Zoloft and up the dosage a couple times and then basically didn't schedule any follow up appointments. I basically went full out party mode and made terrible decisions lacked impulse control and was hyper sexual and engaged in a lot of risky behavior that I am still embarrassed about even today. I eventually stopped taking the zoloft after about a year because my ex found out I was taking it and he said I had no right to be depressed because my life wasn't that badhe was very emotionally abusive. My father was bipolar and we lost him to suicide and my sister is also bipolar. I had no idea that antidepressants alone could trigger a hypomanicmanic episode in some one with bipolar.I knew that there was always something not right with me I would have terrible bouts of depression. I attempted suicide at 14 luckily it didn't work I just screwed up my stomach and I never told my parents. My family never talked about emotions. I didn't even know my dad was bipolar until after his death. My mom said he never believed it and refused to take medication for bipolar. Fast forward to about four years ago I break down and tell my husband that I can't take it anymore and need help. I never admitted it to him but I had a plan for suicide and it scared the shit out of me. On the outside my life seemed great married to my husband who is amazing and the love of my life we have two healthy kidsI also have an older children from my previous relationship and I am a stay at home mom which is something I really wanted. I had extreme anxiety and depression though. I started seeing a therapist who eventually said I needed to see a psychiatrist because I most likely needed meds because my issues were not going to be resolved with therapy alone. I started meds and did an inpatient program for Eating Disorders because I had an existing ED and felt myself falling back into old bad habits in order to deal with my anxiety. The ED treatment was great but my depression and anxiety were still out of control. I told my psychiatrist back my past with zoloftI was finally realizing my behavior while taking it was probably caused by being on it alone. We tried a few antidepressants and they all made me feel irritable or angry. My Dr then starts adding mood stabilizers and antipsychotics to the mix. I look up more on bipolar disorder and start to think that maybe what's wrong with me especially with my family history. I ask my Dr if she thinks I am bipolar and she says no because I don't have any type of hypomanicmanic episode and says she changed my diagnosis to mood disorder. We try a bunch of different combos either they don't work or the side effects are so bad I can't handle them. All things she is prescribing me is medication for bipolar disorder. After three years she then starts prescribing me things I already tried and didn't work the first time. I got a new Dr. The new Dr asks right away if my old Dr thought I was bipolar after I give her the list of meds I have already tried. I see her a couple times and she says she thinks I am bipolar and my extreme attacks of anxiety that come along with not sleeping and being paranoid and suicidal are episodes of dsyphoric hypomania. I am now on my third med change with this Dr. All together I have been on 30 different meds in a little over 4 years. I am so frustrated. I am always med compliant I really want something to work. I was just on Fetzima and lamotrigine. I am so irritable and can't sleep. So my Dr took me off the Fetzima because she thought it was what was causing me problems I think it might be the lamotrigine. She said it was unlikely but I had the same trouble with Vraylar and Rexulti. I am now on the lamotrigine oxcarbazepine and mitrazapine. It's been a week off Fetzima and I am still extremely irritable and not sleeping well. Sorry about the life story. I am just so frustrated and want something to work but I feel like I am starting to run out of options.,Bipolar

46780,46770,What was your tipping point in going to the doctor? Hello everyone new person here. As the title states what was the last straw that drove you to go to the doctor with concerns? Throughout my lifetime I have exhibited symptoms of bipolar disorder or at least how google defines it anyway. My actions have certainly caused much trouble in my life at school when I was younger in my marriage and in my career. Whenever I try to explain myself to my wife I am always at a loss for words about why I do or say the things that I do. My actions are my own and not the result of something else though. I honestly have no idea what to call it or what to do about it. It would just be nice to talk to someone who understands what I am trying to say. Thank you.,Bipolar
50298,50439,How soon do you tell someone youre starting to date? I am currently in the process of getting divorced but looking towards the future and getting back in the dating scene I realized I have absolutely no idea what Im doing! My exhusband was with me when I was diagnosed so its never something I had to really tell him about. I have bipolar II and overall it has been fairly well controlled until recently in going through this divorce. I had a severe for me hypomanic episode followed by a severe depressive episode but now am back on meds picking up the pieces and getting back to a feeling of normalcy. I know that the stress of dealing with my addict ex plus the stress of the divorce absolutely contributed to the severity of these episodes so Im hopeful that moving forward I will continue to be well managed. My concern is that in dating someone eventually I would want them to know what Im dealing with but I understand people who would not want to be with me due to this condition. Obviously telling someone deep mental health stuff on a first date would be offputting but Im just wondering if any of you have found a good way to handle this appropriately?? Thanks in advance you all are amazing.,Bipolar
46258,46252,Symptoms for bipolar disorder? Hello allI'm 18 years old and I'm new to Reddit. When I was ten years old I began to have depression. It wasn't severe but I would often isolate myself from others and think about dying. Over time my depression has gotten worse. However at age 12 I began to have severe mood swings. Sometimes I would get very angry at everybody and everything around me for no reason. Sometimes it would last for a few days and then I would go back to feeling stable or depressed. At age 15 I began to have three distinct and intense emotions that have taken over my life until this point. I rarely felt stable at that point. This feeling can occur for a week or less I feel veryyyyyyy euphoric. I actually love life and everything around me. I feel very energetic and hyper like a five year old. I'm bouncing off the walls and talk very fast because my thoughts race. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because my thoughts would never shut up. However I have never done anything impulsive. I'm mostly abnormally energetic and euphoric. Then I can switch to a depressive episode. These are always the longest they can last for 46 months. At that moment I'm extremely suicidal. I've never tried to commit suicide because I'm scared of failing but the craving is always there. I'm also hopeless think that everybody hates me and I feel so dead and emotionally tired. I sleep for 89 hours and I still feel tired. I can have a good day and still feel extremely miserable even though I know I shouldn't. Then after my depressive episode I can feel super angry and annoyed at everything and everybody for no reason. I just get super angry and lash out at anybody and I don't know why. This lasts for a week or less. I have been to 4 therapists and none of them have really helped I can't really afford one right now. My family aren't very supportive it's taboo to talk about mental illness so they ignore my symptoms or brush them off as hormones since I'm a female. Could I be bipolar? Is it just hormones? your insight would be nice I hope to a doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis but your insight will be helpful. ,Bipolar
45976,45970,How do you know if your emotions are real? Hello BP2 here. This might tap into a more philosophical topic but I can't tell the difference between my actual emotions and my mental disorder. Being BP2 its hard to tell whether I'm actually motivated and happy for once rather than hypomanic. The depressive episodes are easy to tell apart from reasonable sadness because I've suffered from severe depression before my BP symptoms manifested so I can tell the signs more easily. But with mania I just don't know. I can never tell when I'm actually getting better or if I'm just being hypomanic. I don't know if I'm actually genuinely excited about life because I've finally gotten a handle on my mental illness or if my mental disorder is just playing tricks on me and secretly transitioning me into a hypomanic episode. I feel like I'm going crazy having relapsed multiple times over the years.So I guess my question is can you tell the difference between genuine emotion and your regular BP symptoms? If so how?,Bipolar

46758,46748,What do I do in this state? HelloI've only been able to talk about this recently even though I got diagnosed quite a few months ago. I'm on medication and it was working quite well. However it is not doing so as much anymore. I'm having the issue of not sleeping going on 9 days now even though I take seraquil for sleeping. I'm also far less able to control my mood at all and I'm dealing with panic attacks as well. I was just curious if anyone had any advice because im a 22 year old college student who hopefully is graduating in a year or two and I'm honestly unsure what to do in order to be able to do work and focus. Also in addition to being a college student I am in engineering....a field not really welcome to mental health issues. I'm just really worried and don't want to end up failing my classes and ultimately failing out of college or talking like 8 years to graduate. It's scary and new to me to deal with this fear and worry when medication isnt enough? ,Bipolar
49614,49691,Just started the process of getting diagnosed Ive spent years in denial despite obvious signs Hey everyone to start Im a 21 year old female living in the United States. I come from a family that has a close history of Bipolar and ADHD. My grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication hes an addict and has been separated from my family since I was a child. Ive shown signs of being bipolar for a very long time now was diagnosed with ADHD got on the meds for that but still struggled significantly. I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. I have mixed feelings Ive known that this was most likely the answer but I didnt want it to be true. I hate that I have to be the one in my family to carry the bipolar role I know they will look down on me and assume Ill end up the same way that my grandpa did.,Bipolar

49933,50030,TW depersonalization? Feeling like the world isnt real Im not sure what this is and my searches for depersonalization and derealization dont explain what Im feeling.Its as if the world isnt real like its a big simulation. I notice behavioral patterns in people around me that are predictable and consistent and then they do things that are out of pattern and cant explain to me why they do it. I feel like its a glitch. I explain myself to people how I feel about things and they seem to understand and then completely disregard or even forget the conversation and go back on what they agreed to with no cares. Ive realized theyre just moving in their own worlds and cant really be interacted with in any significant way like talking to an NPC in a video game. You get the same three responses. It feels like I am not real. None of this is. Its just like a game or an experiment to interact with others at this point. Like Im the only real human and this is world is all in my head. I feel numb and detached from others like Im watching them on a tv show. Characters. I had a conversation last night and someone was emotional about telling me how much they care about me as a friend and I was just.. observing and thinking its interesting like reading a book or seeing a dramatic movie and I was playing along. I feel we are all just playing roles. And when I step outside of the roles it upsets others even when it means Im just asking to have my needs met. Normally kind people will do the most apathetic things and then be confused if you ask them why they did that. Like they genuinely dont know. TLDR I feel like none of this is real. Myself or others and we are all in a big simulation. I dont feel like a real person.,Bipolar

Only issue is I keep comparing my current situation to the past when tunings were good. I really want to graduate college. I do. I went for three years. However now I cry after every class and have panic attacks at the thought of having to do the work andor study to get through it. Not to mention that my program of study is going to take 2.5 years to complete and I have no motivation. I dont know what to do anymore.

45615,45611,Horrible day.. quit my job on the first day. Hey hows it going?Some stuff happened today and I really need an outlet right now or someone to talk to without judgement... My situation is as follows Im a guy 18 years old have been struggling with bipolar for years where the hospital seems to be my second home.. recently out of an abusive relationship where I impulsively chose to pick up and leave my home my family and my everything all of a sudden to move in with my ex 1000 kilometres away with her parents... thats the extent of how my mania gets along with episodes of psychosis.Recently Ive been looking for work and I found what I thought would be a great job at a health food store I aced the interview and trial then came the first day...I went in full of smiles and just my best to be positive as Ive been in a big low lately then all of a sudden I get there and Im handed the most ridiculous jobs and well all they would do is put me down and make me feel like Im absolute fckin trash. Now I dont know if its because of my arm which they all saw covered in scars or if it was because I chose to not go to college year 11 and 12 when theyre all university graduates or students.. I dont know but they were horrible and I was pretty much in tears for my whole lunch break.. Im a fragile bloke when Im going threw a low is all I can say.. Anyways I got home having a huge anxiety attack so stressed I could feel my impulsiveness and psychotic symptoms coming out.. so I sat down chain smoked till I couldnt breathe and sent my boss an email full of excuses trying to make myself sound normal about quitting after 1 day.. I had to quit I really did if I had thrown myself into that job it would of sent me right back to my lowest low.. the thing is while I got the job I was experiencing a manic episode where I talked myself up Beyond imagninable and asked for 40 hours a week knowing I couldnt handle it but thats just the kind of stuff I do...So thats my little rant of todays horrible events if you were able to actually read it all then well thank you and send me a message if you wanna chat.. I feel extremely guilty right now but any support I can get would really help..Thanks ,Bipolar

12360,12380,I have met this guy who I thought was the most amazing guy I have met in a long time. We seemed to be really into each other enjoyed each other company went on about 4 dates that had me fall for him badly.I have a history of disastrous dating experiences most people I have seen never even got to the dating stage it is just how I am makes people want to distant themselves.I have noticed this time I came on too strong like I confessed him how much I was into him after a couple dates. My social anxiety makes me shut down my personality when I am with someone I like because I am scared of being judged. My mind just goes in auto pilot I blank I stutter and do not even realise I am being weird until afterwards thinking I should have been more spontaneous. I think to his eyes I might have appeared like I did not want to deepen our connection looked uninterested and uninteresting all because I was not comfortable with myself being around him.Also think that the quality of our dates was not varied enough which might have quickly killed the interest we were just hanging out at each others' with no real plan or activity set in place so that might have made it stale.It kind of died when we agreed to meet up one weekend where he said he would let me know if he was free then never called and have not heard from him since then.I am so sad and annoyed that I have allowed the fear of being myself in front of him being the reason of him getting bored of me.I have been through a hell of a year escaping an abusive friendship which has made me miserable for a good part of my days and is still causing me mental distress. I have only slightly mentioned this to him without going too much into detail because I did not want to freak him out just like I have left out many of the issues that I struggle with with my mental health.I cannot see any light I want to be better I want to make me happy and be happy with someone I just never know how much of me it is okay to share with someone. They freak out if I tell them I like them they freak out if I stay silent they freak out if I talk about my demons. I know I should talk about what makes me interesting my dreams my values and what I believe in the truth is I do not have enough self esteem to even be able to believe in myself if I talk about my dreams out loud I would sound unexciting because I have always been the last person to believe in me. it is a lot to ask anyone to put up with such an emotional mess I know no one is perfect but I doubt anyone would want to start a relationship if they fear their partner would be problematic to be around. I might have freaked out the guy I thought I would start dating,Depression

20399,20419,The OP had a really bad bout with depression and asked their parents to pay for therapy. They lived on their own but could not afford an extra 500 a month for weekly sessions. Parents could apparently completely afford it. Without their parents money they did not have resources to go to therapy. Their parents had recently not been providing money and OP could not go to therapy as result. They were asking if they would be an asshole for asking them to send money since their depression was getting worse. OP said the decision to ask for money in the first place was difficult. Everyone jumped down OPs throat and said they were selfish for asking in the first place and that they were clearly old enough to afford an extra 500 or that they needed to find a cheaper therapist. I think the users showed a clear misunderstanding of how much therapy costs and how important therapy is. I do not know It sucks that therapy is so inaccessible and that people are shamed for requesting assistance. As a person with depression asking for help is hard enough. I cannot even mention that I am going to therapy without people being weird. It sucked to see people saying um if you cannot afford it on your own then you should just not go. So easy Yeah I was put in that situation and it pushed me to the edge. A recent AITA post reminded me of my own struggles with getting therapy,Depression

10785,10805,I am a 26 yo father who suffers from agoraphobia anxiety and depression. In the last 5 years I have worked extremely hard to better myself in my career as a father and with my mental health. I graduated barber school about 4 years ago and had been regularly talking with clients and co workers. About 6 months ago I decided it was time to venture forward and open up my own Mobil barbershop. All the way until the beginning of this month I had been working in a shop and working on completely gutting out and building a barbershop inside a bus. I accomplished my task and created a beautiful shop. Now I have been waiting on my freelance license and my plates and registration for my bus. Since the beginning of the month. The truth is though I have not been able to bring myself to go turn in the paperwork to get the process started. I have completely backslid to who I was before I became a father and a barber. I do not see the point in utterly anything. Even if I know that it will better my life I cannot bring myself to rarely even leave the house anymore. I have split custody of my daughter and to be completely honest. I have NOT been the father I know she deserves. I have been letting her watch tv entirely too much this weekend and I can barely bring myself to interact with her. I mean I am doing the necessary parts of being a parent. Food shelter comfort but I know that I need to do better. I know how it feels not to fake it and this is not it. I feel like the biggest failure on this planet right now and I do not see any end in sight. Thank you for taking the time to read my jibber jabber. I do appreciate it.

15050,15070,I feel like there is no good way of describing how I am feeling to people who do not get it. I have absolutely no desire to participate in normal life anymore. Any social event I have to participate in is almost 100 faked. Every small setback just makes me give up even more. I have to hold back tears almost all day every day. But I feel like I cannot call in sick to work because they will just call me lazy and emotional. So now it is a really bad headache or a migraine that sends me to my dark quiet bedroom for the rest of the night. People can relate to headaches and do not try and tell you to just stop having headaches. at this point I barely still give a shit about pleasing other people but I still do for now. Maybe if life gets a little worse I will be less afraid to just say it is taking everything in my power to just get out of bed every day. and not give two shits about whether they believe me or relate to me anymore.

I have always been confident I would never kill myself because of how it would affect my family members but as the perspective of my situation has gotten more clear due to the stress of university I have borderline fantasized over it I have known for years now on what I need to do to improve my situation but never had the discipline to stick with my attempts. honestly I know realistically I will never amount to anything or start a family and feel worse as time goes on being a fuck up at 18 is fine you can fix it and have a good youth and future fuck up at 30 I presume is soul destroying let alone being alone at 50. Rambled a bit but is it normal or concerning to have thoughts involving suicide even if you do not think you will do it? Are these thoughts that can escalate? Is it normal to have thoughts of suicide when your life is a mess even if you think you would not do it?,Depression
25591,25611,I have dealt with depression and anxiety quite bad for the past few years I am 18f and as a result I feel like I am quite behind in life I guess. I left school early to do a beauty course which I enjoyed and thought I would like to go into that industry but towards the end of it I completely lost interest which negatively impacted my mental health then I worked in a hair salon just as an assistant for 6 months and I finished there about a year and a half ago now and have not worked since. Since I finished the course I did I have not been able to find any sort of career that interests me for longer than a few months which just really puts me in a rut by not being able to decide on something and formulate a plan to work toward. It also feels like I let myself down. I have pretty much been living life by myself since I finished school as I do not really have many hobbies or any friends to really talk to or hang out with and as a result of this I never leave the comfort that is my room and its really hard for me to go out anywhere in public. One thing that I think would benefit me greatly would be getting a job but I just can never seem to keep any positive thoughts towards finding one in the last two months I have applied to about 5 which takes a lot of effort for me to do and not heard back but the day after I apply I end up having a major panic attack over it and hoping I do not get a call back because the thought of going to an interview is terrifying to me and I am sure a lot of others. I have spoken to my mum about my worries and she is very supportive of me which I am very grateful for and she helped work on my resume for me and explained my skills and things to me but even with this support its still so hard to find something. I found a reception job which seems like an alright thing for me to do and I have written a cover letter for it but I have talked myself out of applying and can start to feel the negative thoughts tumbling around me already. Its hard to find something as I have very minimal experience and do not want to work more than 25 hours a week I know I am picky. This might seem like a silly thing to be distressed about but its a topic that has been my biggest worry for a while and I would like to be making money so I can help with bills and be able to have money to spend for myself I have things that motivate me to want a job but I just feel so stuck and like I cannot make myself take any steps to actually move forward. Its something that if I have not been keeping on top of supporting myself I end up spiralling and having a breakdown over and getting very worked up about. I am not sure if any of that really makes sense of what I am trying to say but I am just so over feeling this way and being afraid of something so simple as applying for a job. I think its more what comes after I have applied like getting a phone call for an interview and then what questions Ill be asked at the interview and meeting new people and then if I do get the job what if I mess it up or do not like it? I think that a part of me holds myself back because I am scared to be doing normal life things I stay home pretty much everyday and do not really do much other than be in bed and read or watch tv so its scary to think about going out and having something to do even if it is only a few days a week. My apologies for the long post but Id really appreciate any advice or something even just if anyone has feltfeels anything similar. kind of a rant? I feel stuck and do not know how to move forward.,Depression

I usually answer that question with oh i like a more private life I have been too busy Covid am i right?No i just told him I hate people almost as much as I dislike myself. Its hard for me to speak to people because I know deep down most could not give two fucks about me. Still I am kind and well mannered but its hard talk to the same person for an extended amount of time without those thoughts trying to come out.I asked for meds too hopefully I can actually be more like a person on them Told the truth to my therapist.,Depression

25180,25200,I am trying to sell my house get a new job and move all at the same time and I cannot take the stress anymore. I worked my ass off for the the next 2 months and everything is coming together. I got an offer for a really good job 104K a year which is a ton of money for me but I fucked up typing on the background check and put the wrong year for one of my positions I put 20202021 instead of 20192020 and now it is all fucked up and they think I am lying about when I worked and I am worried about that they are going to take the offer away. All my friends and family say it is going to be fine but my depressed brain does not believe them. To make matters worse I already quit my other job once I got this job because they needed me to start in August. If I do not get this job I do not know what I am going to do. I literally just laid in bed all day today. I was so looking forward to having a break but now I do not even know if I will be getting the new job. All I wanted was a month off to do what I wanted knowing I would be okay but now I cannot even enjoy the time because I am so worried about not getting the job because of this dumb fucking background check typo. Today was really rough for me I just feel like I completely crashed,Depression
25338,25358,I remember months ago where when I was sad I used to cry so much all the time think and cry after my parents were gaslighting and manipulating me I would cry. Now I cannot. I do not know if this is weird to say but I miss crying. I feel like I do not feel if something happens good or bad I do not react anymore and if I do its usually anger. I do not care about anything anymore. I also feel invalidated because my other depressed friend cries often and is upset even when they are out with me and I never do that. I never cry infront of anyone or even at terrible things I do not so i feel like i do not have it as bad and maybe i am getting better but i do not feel like i am i feel like i am getting worse. What do i do? Numbness,Depression
16758,16778,Asterisk because I have never been diagnosed and I do not actually know what is it that I am struggling with. Anyway. I see now that it will never go away. This sadness will simply always be here. And it will continue pushing people away from me because I know that being close to someone depressed is painful and frustrating. I will not be able to shortleash it anyway so why even try. I will never find a bfor a gf sigh because no one will stick around with me because I am tiring and no fun. Idk if my friends will stay I will not judge them if they choose to leave because of the whole stop talking to toxic people thing. And I am that I am upsetting and boring I am angry frustrated anxious hardly a positive experience. My sister tolerates me and I feel bad because yknow you cannot really leave your sibling unless they are a serial murderer or something so she will have to endure me depression will always stand between me and people,Depression
24676,24696,My depression seems to be treatment resistant. No matter what I do it goes away for a bit then always comes back. As a kid I saw a psychiatrist who gave me CB therapy. As an adult I have seen another psychiatrist who is prescribed me 3 different antidepressants none of them worked for long. I am not taking any meds now. I see two social workerstherapists weekly but lately I do not want to anymore since it does not seem to help me all that much. The only thing that helps sometimes is weed but that is not reliable either. Since depression has haunted me my whole life so far I feel like it will continue to do so till the day I die. I have this horrifying premonition that Ill have another horrible episode and kill myself around my 40s since I already attempted it twice already. Sorry to get all morbid Treatment resistant depression,Depression

7585,7605,So I am about to be 23 and ever since I tired 18 my family has been against me They wanted me out the day that I turned 18 which is like two days after my graduation in with a lot of physical and mental abuse from my mom and my stepdad my stepdad would beat me about whatever else he can get his hands on and then my mom will come home if my brother and I ever gave you any lip she is fine whatever she could to hit us with whether it was a spoon and a DVD slipper a shoe there was anything she could finally get hit with it so I moved out at 18 with my best friend in high school thinking that you know we had jobs lined up with the stuff that we can do for income and in reality he move me up there because he was hoping that I would be the one to get a job and take care of them so I did that for a few months while I was in Green Bay and do with us not having food and everything I SH really really bad and to the point that my girlfriend at the time will come get me. We we had to hunt geese with rocks because we had no money or food. From there I moved to Sauk city to be with my girlfriend at the time and all she did was take advantage of me. She took all my money medications and the worst part is her and I had gotten pregnant and she made me pay for my abortion even though I wanted to keep the kid. Before the abortion she would ask me for money which I had no issue with it at the same time she was selling nudes while she was in collage. I did not find out about that until three weeks after I had to pay for the abortion. So after that I moved to baraboo with my friends and they drained 12000 from my bank account because I assumed we were going to go halfs on everything and in reality they used me for all my money. I have been homeless for three years and I really do not know what to do. Anyone please give me advise. I really need somone to help with what is going on Any advice is welcome,Depression

Out of nowhere I started to remember the way that she used to comment on my body and how she used to compare me to other girls in my age the way that she started the eating disorder traits that I have now and I cannot help but to think she wants to keep me as a prisoner. I live in a very conservative society so whatever I do to help myself facing those who try to control my life my mother included Ill be the selfish one even though I am grown ass woman!Then I start thinking..she is not that bad she can be annoying coward and she has a victim complex but overall she is not the devil!I wonder if my depression is getting worse playing games on me making me hate everyone give them the cold shoulder I truly no longer know if these feelings are true or its just my brain fucking me up irrational hatred,Depression

10812,10832,I am 24 now and maybe it was my dysfunctional family my upbringing my environment. I have always been shy introverted and never really talk to people. I had good friends as a child but into high school I did not have anyone. people are fake users deceiving. I did not understand how relationships happened how people date. what is this love teachers give to their students. kids going out to parties but I could not fit in kids have friend groups and do stupid funny things i could not have. I thought I had a friend group in college and this girl messed it all up because she had caught feelings for her exes best friend and then because he was not giving it to her she slept with his other friend and thus the whole group split. I understand her feelings I want to experience a relationship but this whole society seems messed up. I cannot even deal with the long distance relationships. I need something here and now in the moment. I wish I could just forget it all and just have the motivation to be the person I want to be be good at learning languages producing music web design graphic design film editing photography hitting the gym doing stocks and finance like there are just so many things I could do for myself but I do not have the motivation at all. even in my current job I get so bored quickly reading all these white papers I want to get out and be proactive.

I am not suicidal in the summer just sort of empty but not numb per say This sounds really corny I am just using words I have heard other people use. But right now I feel really really terrible and its summer. This has been reoccuring but not to the extent of how severe it is in winter.

I cannot motivate myself to do anything when it does not even feel like I am real. The feeling is so genuine that I cannot even say that I know it sounds crazy. That being said I still cannot bring myself to tell anyone in my life that I feel this way. As much as it make sense to me no one around me will get it. It would just freak them out. Does anyone else feel this way? What would be a good way to potentially bring this up to someone? I do not have a clue how I would even start that convo. I feel like I do not exist,Depression

Idk if it comes from childhood or some other because I look like a robot when dancing flirting speaking to a group of people or even showing my anger.I keep trying daytoday to improve but it feels very unnatural to show emotions. I just cannot do it. I am not a sociopath or anything I feel so much on the inside but unable to show it effectively to others. I look like a weirdo or a creep when I try to.

I was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. I was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. It was all going good until the next week. I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing fyi first time. Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me fun. Fine I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text no response for days. Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know my school work began to pile up and was now behind awesome! But the funny thing is the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever my exwho hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with dmed me months after our last talk. Ok I am not upset or angry at her she changed alot and is happy with her new bf something I was hoping she would get but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I should not have done this mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new lifemind you I wished for her happiness because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope. I am so tired of having straight up bad luck I want good things to happen I also feel karma may have something to do with thisI am just done. The worst depressive wave this year,Depression

She asked me how I felt and also said that I do have panic attacks which felt so freeing to know what I was feeling was not all in my head.

Am I going to be happy? Am I smart enough to pass the exams and graduate?Will I get stable career depending on the major I decide on?Its hard and I still cannot decide. Business sounds promising but its boring and I am horrible at math. English sounds great too but the career opportunities are more than bad.I have applied to so many majors at different unis but it are not worth writing about.What if no matter my effortsIm going to kill myself? If it will be too much?I hate the thought of killing myself but its constantly on my mind so I guess its what I have to do some day.Its kind of funny because I never thought of life being this miserable when I was a kid.Was and is my dad abusive?yes. But I still had the fire in me you know.Its such a struggle. Do I need a lot of money? No but I am unhappy with my body and my face so I need surgeryskincare products etc to feel worthy. Worthy to stay alive.Soyeah actually I DO need more money aka a well paying job but most jobs require degrees in field which make me want to kill myself even more because I do not feel skilled enough and will not graduate whatsoever.Looks like I am going to disappoint my inner child and die without reaching any of my goals. I have always dreamt of being an actress or working in a museumbook shop but it will not happenthanks to the money issue and lack of will to live.Nothing special in my lifes going to happen because I will as mentioned before probably kill myself no matter what.

I feel hopeless and am just alive to exist because it is so hard to find joy in anything. I do not want to kms but I do not want to exist either.

10482,10502,it is been a while since I really enjoyed or took pleasure in things. Video games were just a distraction fucking is just a routine etc.I cannot comprehend how everyone keeps going to work and spending the majority of their time doing something they hate. Working overtime to save up for that nice new car you can drive back to work with. Paying interest maintenance and fuel so we can go to work. I know there is people out there starving who would do anything for shelter and food and I know I am incredibly fortunate relatively speaking.I am trying to make thing easier for my wife getting our house ready for sale. Selling other non essentials. I think that is the only purpose I really feel I have in life at the moment. Not to leave her in a shitty situation.I have tried the recommended treatments but I guess deep down I do not see any point pushing on really. Maybe I do not want to get better because I think the normal life is boring. I would love to skip to retirement but then you have to see your loved ones get sick and die which would be terrible I would lose my mind as I do occassionally when work makes me anxious.I hope whatever the afterlife is it is better.

I try to talk about my feelings with others but I just end up scaring my friends away and making my parents mad. I just end up getting into fights with my loved ones. I want to kill myself so badly but I do not have the courage to do it and I feel bad for my parents. I have thought about jumping from the balcony so many times but I think about my family discovering my corpse and I just cannot do it.On second thought people say I am just too entitled and I make things up in my head that is why I do not make effort to get better. I might just as well do it since it seems my life has no worth anyway. I want nothing more than to never exist,Depression

25801,25821,Most subs do not understand this whenever i say this but i just cannot take it anymore. These two people I run into in one of my favorite games and modes within said game and it is just the worst experience ever whenever I play against them. They spam laugh they taunt they talk shit to us in chat and they win every single game every single time and I just want to slit my wrists every time. I put so much time and effort in taking the little oppurtunities i have for fun to the highest degree but the game just gets ruined every time. I then start connecting it to my own worth and i want to just end it all I have cut because of it in the past. These people will never understand never stop never get consequences and i want to die. Running into the same people in a game and it makes me want to waste away and die.,Depression
19301,19321,This happened a little while ago but it still bothers me that the person who was supposed to help me did me so dirty. About 5 years ago now I was really struggling and made the decision to try therapy one more time as I finally had insurance that would cover part of it. Prior to this Id attempted therapy twice once was 2 sessions with a student counselor through my college but I was ultimately told that the free counselors they could provide were not qualified to handle my range of trauma and that it would be better if a sought out a licensed therapist which I could not afford. The next time I did try and go to someone who was licensed they also told me I was not a good fit. I was seemingly functioning fine in the day to day I thought I was in retrospect not at all and again my trauma was not their skill set. They suggested I seek out someone specialized. So I gave up for a while. It was not until my life was taking a major dive and I realized I was out of control to stop it that I tried again. Shortly before I began looking for a therapist I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 26. In general I am so pissed at not being listened to or just overlooked by doctors. That could be its own rant. But I was only diagnosed because I asked if it was possible. Id learned the actual symptoms of how ADHD presents in both women and adults for the first time and it was eye opening. So much of what Id complained about or told doctors I struggled with attention time management zoning off explained in one simple and now obvious thing. The tests were more than conclusive. So when I came across a therapist that specialized in ADHD along with supposedly some of my other specific traumas I felt it would be good to be able to figure out a path forward with someone who understood how ADHD affects how I might function and think. The first red flag I should have paid more attention to and I am still shocked by it. I had started to suspect I might be bipolar in addition to my depression but was scared what that might mean for me. A few sessions in I brought it up. I still clearly remember her response Oh no you are not bipolar. You have cyclical depression. Bipolar you would have manic episodes where you think you can fly or kidnap a kid and think its your own or do really impulsive damaging things. I said the last bit sounds like me and she said But you do not think you can fly or that you are invincible right? I said no she said not bipolar. I have never been diagnosed to this day but the older I get the more I suspect it and I know that there is more than one type of bipolar and think she was very wrong to dismiss me. If she would have let me I would have told her how I have times where I am convinced nothing bad will come of spending money that leaves me in financial ruin time and time again and I know its not normal. Or how I moved to a different country on a split second decision. Or how every tattoo I have ever had I have decided to get and gotten within 48 hours or less with no foresight and usually regret after. At the start she was easy to talk to and ended up helping me with my ADHD by giving me a referral to a doctor that specializes in only mental health and they prescribed me meds that have vastly improved my quality of life. We did not focus on my past trauma at the beginning its really hard for me to bring up and she would never ask me anything or suggest something from my life we should talk about except the ADHD. Which to me was a small facet of my life that was now being taken care of by the prescribing doctors 1 hour sessions at the beginning there were 5 or 6 in the first 3 months and now they are once every 3 months. It got to the point of me just complaining about my problems from the week or my stresses about the upcoming week which was not really the reason I started going but it still helped. she would try and tie everything to the ADHD and I just let it go. I did not have the energy to find another therapist I still figured wed get around to it eventually and just knowing I had my weekly appointment coming up helped me get through a lot of the daily crap that would come up and Id have to deal with. After about 9 months or so of weekly sessions she shocked me one day by telling me that she did not think she would be able to help me as I was too resistant to discussing the ADHD and that it was not worth the financial strain of the copay which it was I still paid 50 each session to talk about my day to day problems. She said we should focus on an end date unless I was willing to put more work in to it. I said we still had not gotten around to any of what I told her I needed to deal with in my first session and she said that she was not really qualified for the extent of my trauma but that we could try though she suggested I see multiple counselors at the same time and that was probably the only way Id be able to get the help I needed. Now possibly the most overwhelming of my past trauma is abandonment related. Which she knew. In my brain there would never be an end to therapy. I was settling in to the idea of seeing her and every week until I moved or she retired. I was comfortable there I felt safe with her and the routine so when she said we should end things it brought it all back. I can truly see that moment as when the final dominos started to fall. I went from feeling to safe to desperate to be worthy. I agreed to whatever just so she would not end the sessions. The first thing she did was something that she told me was a new exciting method to help patients stop disassociating and bring them in to the present. Was disassociating a problem a little but later found out what Id been describing to her is maladaptive daydreaming. She just decided it was disassociation because of the ADHD.The method was this first you closed your eyes and sat very still and centered yourself. She would say feel your feet feel your hands feel your breath etc. Basic meditationgrounding exercises you can get free on YouTube. Then you would open your eyes and for however long until she said stop you had to tell her exactly what you are feeling and noticing and thinking presently. You could not think or say I am really stressed. It had to be physical like I see a clock on the wall. My leg itches. there is a book on the bookshelf with a red spine. Anytime you would veer off a little she would stop you and make you do it right. I hated it. Every time Id make these complaints she would tell me its supposed to be uncomfortable that is how you know its working. The thing was Id spend all week preparing to talk about something important. Id take notes on what I wanted to talk about. I remember a few times I brought in letters or journals from my past I wanted to discuss and wed NEVER get around to any of it because she would spend at least the first 30 minutes doing the damn exercises and another 5 minutes every other session trying to convince me to join her ADHD group therapy sessions which were another 50 copay no matter how many times I said no. I started leaving feeling frustrated and sad that I had not gotten to discuss what was actually quite difficult for me to prepare to say. Perhaps because of the fact that every single session I showed up with heavy thoughts on my mind and every single session she would force us to begin with this stupid exercise but she made me so much worse. Id been casually disassociating forever. She did not teach me any skills to process or cope with these things being on the surface. But now my anxiety is tied with my life I cannot separate the two. Doing things like looking at a clock or noticing a book on a shelf gives me anxiety. I am constantly overwhelmed by that fear of impending doom whenever I try and focus on reality. The only way I can get some respite is if I can manage to zone out the rest of the world entirely which includes my day to day. I went from functional to entirely nonfunctional. Therapy with her ended when I had decided to move which went badly. I was going to move in with a friend across the country. In the weeks leading up to the move anytime I expressed my doubts or fear something would go wrong she would tell me to stop focusing on the worry and just let something good happen. Yea well friend showed up to drive back with me and was a major AH and went from being my absolute best friend I have ever had still to years later were still not speaking. And I had no skills to cope and had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. These days I am not even a little okay. I am not bringing in enough to make ends meet. My car is my income and it needs repairs. I used to shower daily now sometimes I cry because I want to shower so bad and cannot bring myself to do it. The depression makes it so hard to get out the door and work and if I do not manage it then the depression gets worse. I signed up for cerebral tonight because I need help bad and my insurance does not cover it. My grandma is helping me pay for it for now which makes me feel awful but I cannot on my own. My first therapist appointment is Monday and I am so scared they are going to be like all the others and tell me they cannot help me. I am so alone and lost idk what Ill do if they cannot. My grandma is the only person I know within a 4 hour drive and for reasons Id rather not go in to is not the best emotional support. If you made it to the end thanks so much for listening. Remember you are not alone and who you are is beautiful. I am starting therapy again after my last one was a horrible experience and I need to vent about it for a minute,Depression

6962,6982,I recently went through a breakup and she said she still wants to be friends so I said I can try doing that but when she talks to me about things it always hurts. I just want to lose feelings so all this pain can stop it hurts so much and I cannot even cry about it. I do not want to hurt her because she said she does not want to never speak to me again but I do not know what to do here. When we were together she always hurt me so I do not know why I still love her. I wish we never met it would be much less painful How do I lose feelings?,Depression
21572,21592,I will never be good at something. Why?Because to be good at something you need to like it at least a little bit enough so you can be motivated to do engage in that activity.But I have no interests. I have spent 2 years trying like mad to find an interest. Reddit google wikipedia etc... I did so much research trying to find at least 1 interest. But my anhedonic brain just does not like anything. And I definitely will not be interested enough in anything to like it enough to the point I spend enough time in it that I become good at it. Anhedonia depression ADHD is a hell of a combination. I really want to be good at something it is one of my biggest wishes to be really good at something. I NEED to be good at something if I am ever to have a good life especially in this third world country. But it will never happen because of my anhedonia and lifelong depression.,Depression

14967,14987,Covid did a real number on me In terms of my mental health for the past year and a half I have felt isolated lonely self conscious etc. I have begun smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking to help at times with boredomsadness and I am only 16. I have been on my meds since December and they have helped in ways but its still so difficult to keep going. Today I woke up to both my mom and brother panicking that they could not find our cat of four years. Our first cat we have ever had and she is been with us for so many journeys and has been a loving companion. We live on a farm with many outdoor cats but we would not let our indoor cats out as often because they did not mingle well with the others. Well our indoor cat she got out last night because of me. Because I am too selfish and greedy that I could not leave it for one night and had to go smoke my dumbass left the door open and she left at some point. we have searched all day to no avail I can tell my brother resents me for this I understand what hes feeling but it still does not take away the pain nor the guilt of losing her. I am not even man enough to admit that I was smoking and that is why she got out. My mom keeps telling me this is a natural part of life and that she suspected that she may have been sick anyways still does not hurt any less. I have been suicidal for a little while now but to chicken to do anything about it but honestly this was the last thing I needed and it may have been the thing to push me over the edge. I am just so sad and miss her so much already. I do not know if I am going to do it but I am just so done with life and all the shit that is been thrown my way. Sorry for the rant been needing to vent and do not have a therapist to do so with. Thanks for reading.N I think I am going to kill myself,Depression
47792,47775,Im getting tired of trying Hi guys. First time on this sub. Im here because i cant talk about this with anyone anymore. My gf is tired of hearing my depressed talk. Family too. I dont blame them. Ive always suffered from anxiety but its been a year since Ive been experiencing depression. Im not diagnosed not been to therapy Ive been broke and have to eat too. But its an overwhelming feeling. I feel tired i dont wanna do anything. Its hard for me to enjoy anything. I feel like Im a failure. Im about to be 30 and I dont have shit my career as an artist sucks im not getting no clients and also its extremely hard to put myself out there cause I feel like im So miserable people will be able to tell. I dont wanna see people anymore I hate to being asked how im doing. I feel its exhausting for my loved ones to deal with me and I cant really blame them. Its exhausting for me too. Maybe they dont have the tools to understand. Im never hungry anymore. Something triggered me yesterday a friend of mine is getting engaged and i hate myself cause I really wanna be happy For them and I am. But also served as a reminder for me im in a very low point in my life and I dont know how to get out. It makes me feel so miserable when I think of how miserable i ended up to be. If that makes sense. And ive tried to do certain things. Learning new things. To distract myself. But i still have this overwhelming sadness on me and I really try to ser a way this will get better but seems to only get worse. I really dont see the right path. My dreams and aspirations are all broken and I can only cry when thinking about them. And i know theres plenty people in probably worse situations than myself and I feel like maybe I shouldnt be complaining. But i dont know what to do. Theres so many layers to this. I often ser my belongings and think of whatll people do with them if I die. I try to imagine the world without me and itll really wont be missing anything. Im thinking about my death every day now and Im afraid. Im writing this here cause I dont feel I have people to talk about this anymore and just wanted to let it out. I tried t summarize it as much as I could.,Depression
48243,48223,How long does it take to know if an antidepressant is going to work or I need to try a different one? Ive tried 4 now where they made it worsethe side effects where unbearable but now Ive been on sertraline and the side effects are tolerable but hasnt helped with my anxiety or depression. Its been 4 weeks and today the nurse practitioner gave me the choice to try something else or increase the dose. I asked her what I should do but she said it was up to me. I didnt know what I should do so I just said increase the dose because the pills are cheap and I have to pay full price for everything until I hit my deductible. I dont know if a month is too short to know or if should be seeing a little improvement by now. Im starting to think I should have chose a different medicine but I dont know maybe I am jumping the gun here and I should just stick it out. This medicine makes me really tired,Depression

I use to pray to the universe god and goddess but now I cannot bring myself to it when I do its like I am not heard. I feel like I do not belong anywhere I am too emotional for people to understand why I am like that. I barely understand myself I have BPD but when I am having these moments of self hatred or overthinking I loose it. I can convince myself into killing myself at that moment. But I told my little sister Ill be here for her and told my love ones Ill always be here but for some reason I cannot seem to have someone by my side because I am worried Ill waste their time or I am too annoying to something. So I rather tell them I am ok then wasting their time with me. I stopped going to therapy because I felt bad. I do not know why I am writing this.

15361,15381,Yesterday I was finally having a great time after a lot of shitty days i was cooking while listening to my favourite music I was feeling so good... until my mother came then the music just stopped and I started feeling like always. I had a Knife in my hands and I thought about stabbing myself with it but it would be stupid. Its a shit to live with someone like my mom. She has 0 empathy to other people and she is also very hypocrite.She always told us to be kind to other people to do not judge them for their appareances. Then she said that my sister's taste for clothes is like going to a Carnaval or costume party.She always told us to do not lie and to not hide the truth but she is always lying to my dad and telling him that we need money for school or something. Then my dad send her money and it just evaporates or something she has A LOT of shoes in her closet.She always told us that the violence is not a solution but i clearly remember hearing her threatening my sister. Saying that she would break her face if she does not listen and obbey. I also can remember the day she came form work and hit me because I had not thrown the trash.She always told us that we can trust her but she has been bothering me a lot because I do not care about her anymore and she thinks that I smoke weed or something. Seriously? the person who since he was a child has refused alcohol every time you have offered him?She also told us that she care about us and she is always ther to hear and hep us but when I said that i only wanted to be calm she got mad and started yelling at me and asking if she is the reason I am like this. Then she said that she does not care if I am fake. When i get home from work i want you to be smiling and hug me she said. Almost everyday she ask me if I have something to tell her or if I need help or Blah blah blah. I always says no. I does not want to talk to her because I now that it would get even worse. This morning she made me wake up at 4.30 AM and cross the whole damn city with her. Then when we arrived to the place we waited 20 minutes and she told me that I did not needed to be there and that i could go home. Wtf? She knows that I have School so she just wanted to disturb me. Fortunately will not see her for the next 2 days as she will be in the hospital. She showed me the way there but I am not going to visit her. I forgot to write a loooot of things but I started feeling worse and i have to leave. Everytime my mom is near me I just want to stab myself with a Knife,Depression

23872,23892,alright so first i have to admit that my biggest need in life is to feel loved. not just loved but to have someone that finds me attractive and is turned on by me and my body. including my penis. now when i was younger. say teen and young adult. i really did not care too much about my penis size. sure i would be a bit embarressed by it and was always one to hold off on sexual activities until i had been with a girl for a little while. but it did not because depression. I am in my 30's now and my life experiances has taken me from thinking size is not everything to litterally crying more often then i would like to admit over my penis size. I am a grower first off. and at full staff its not too bad i guess. below average but not micro by any means. but soft its less then an inch for sure. in fact. when I am sitting down its litterally inside me. anyway. because of this i have never been much for one night stands or to go around having sex with lots of woman. with the exeption of twice in my life i have just been a long term relationship type. i have had 4 previous relationships one was marriage for almost 10 years. and i am on my 5th currently. all 4 of those i was cheated on. multiple times. my ex wife i had even found that she was telling the other guys that i was small and she did not get turned on my it. taking something i was already a little self consious about and adding in that EVERY girlfriend i have had has cheated on me. i am now VERY needy in terms of exeptence of my penis size. my current relationship we have sex once or twice a month and that is it. she says she is just not a very sexual person. but see we were friends before we started dating and she used to talk about loving to give blowjobs and she even had a FWB just because she loved giving them so much she had someone she could just go suck any time she wanted. so i cannot help but feel like its me. like i have an underwelling penis that just does not get her going. my life at this point revolves around my self loathing over my penis size. I feel like the ONE thing i need more then anything i can never have because no girl gets excited about small penis'. the best i hear is woman that say they do not mind it. or that it does not matter to them. but i clearly have never even found that. i do love my current girlfriend and she is good to me any many non sexual ways. and i feel i cannot give my true feelings to her because that might seem like guilt tripping and when it comes to sex guilt tripping someone in many ways is a bit..... well... i cannot think of the word so i will use an example. a guy that guilts a woman into sex because she gave him blue balls would be considered a pig right? so i feel like if i talked about this with her it would be similar. like..... oh you should have sex with me more because i need to feel like my penis size is ok.... i just cannot do that. i do not feel right about it. even if i know in my head that is not my reason. in my head I am not doing it as a guilt trip. that is still kind of too close to the same category. so i sit here. so damned depressed that i cannot even take care of myself when i feel the urge sometimes. i feel sad and like i will never feel truly loved and desired. you know let us talk about porn for a moment. i am not one to use it when i am in a relationship. but i had a few years between my ex and my current girl to have watched a bit and really dig around to see what is out there. and i am starting to cave a bit and use it from time to time just because of how in frequent we have sex. but the point of bringing up porn is this.... there is fetishes for basically everything. feet fetishes. old people. fat people. short people. tall people. big boobs. small boobs. ect ect. i mean the list is endless. but you know what i cannot find? a porn fetish catagory for woman that like small dicks. you can find a fetish for woman that like to be pee'd on and deficated on. but not that like small penis'. in fact. the only small penis fetish i can find is HUMILIATION. which is the LAST thing i want to see and just know that its out there depresses me even more. its depressing to think that every woman i have ever been with has been so displeased by it that they decided to go find a bigger one to play with on the side. i tried anonymous video sites a few times when i was single and that left me crying every time. you find a girl that wants to cam with you. and as soon as she see's what i am working with she either clicks off immediatly or she stays to laugh and call it small. there was one time that i thought that maybe witholding the information that i had a small dick until the relationship was a few weeks old or more was my problem. so when i was talking to this one girl i waiting for her to bring up sex in the conversation and when she finally did i informed her i was small. she asked for a picture so i sent her one. she litterally just stopped replying. never heard from her again. like. i genuinly feel like maybe they feel like they have been scammed or something. start a relationship with me. i seem like a good boyfriend. and then bam. small dick. i do not know what to do. i know i should not put so much into my penis size. but my life experiances has caused this and i can no longer convince myself its ok. i can no longer believe size does not matter. or its the motion of the ocean. or that looks are not everything. or that you can make up for it in bed with other things like mouth skills and so on. i just want someone to genuinly like my penis. and i will never have that. small member causing major depression,Depression

10719,10739,People do not really want to know how you are. They expect a quick response. So I say I am fine. I am not fine. Far from it. But they do not want to know that I woke up exhausted. That I started crying as soon as my eyes opened. That I do not want to do absolutely anything and even watching tv is too much for me. That there is a heaviness weighing on my heart that can only be compared to mourning. That I honestly do not think I will ever be happy. That my favorite songs are making me inexplicably sad. That my dreams will never come true. That no one can save me. That my family will not understand when I am gone. That I am so sorry for everything. They do not want to know all that. So I say I am fine. Hey how are you? I am fine.,Depression

8201,8221,do not really know where to start so I am going to recount my life a bit. I am a moderately healthy 16yearold who started high school last year. In my country we start high school as 15yearolds. My family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. My parents are still together and I would say they raised me pretty well considering. I have an older brother and an older sister who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but I am still really close to both of them. I love my family and my pets a lot. Right now I think they are the only reason I am still breathing.I have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. I had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. I did not go to kindergarten because of it. When school started I used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. My stomach ached and I was trembling every morning for years. I was just too scared to go to school because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. I missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. I made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday I was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. At the age of seven I held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so I did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much I hated it.Obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. For years it was absolutely useless. They just made me do these weird excersises which I am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. The only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. For example if I had a field trip in a month to a zoo my parents would take me and my siblings there together so I would have an easier time to go there again. This helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. My anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.When I was about to advance to seventh grade 13yearold me my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. Couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying all my best friends were on the same class as me I had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. Life was going really well at this point and even though I was anxious I could go to school pretty normally even though I still missed many days. At it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so I had to stay home a lot. Whenever things were going bad I thought about suicide but never planned it out.On my last year before high school my anxiety just skyrocketed and with it I became very depressed. I was not too outgoing before but now I could not even go to the store without anyone else. I did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though I really liked being with them. Before I was a staight A student but I could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. I was a perfectionist yet I did not care if I finished my assinments anymore. My grades dropped heavily. Smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. On some nights I did not eat because I could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. Some days I could not get out of bed. So many of my hobbies became untouched. I could not play games like before I could not play he piano anymore and I could not write stories like I used to. I became entirely paralysed.My therapist was really worried about how I was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. I was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that I was otherwise doing just fine even though I was basically dying inside. My mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. I was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that I was barely functioning. This was the first time I could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. I was in so much pain. The only things I cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because I could not keep up anymore. The only reason I did not kill myself was because I did not want to die in pain and I had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. I have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. Not to my family not to my friends and not to my therapist because I am afraid of he consequences.During that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework news or worry about outside life. They wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so I could enjoy my time playing games. I have never felt so relieved. Before that I was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday The freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. At the end of those two weeks I returned to school. I was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end I was beginning to feel a lot worse again. All that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. I had just pushed them away from my mind. I became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like I never left.That same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. No pressure no expectations. I did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. I was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window I could see how wonderful the weather was outside. I could finally do the things I liked again and I could actually enjoy them this time.That did not last of course because then I went to high school to continue my studies. To my surprise the first weeks went well even though I was really anxious. Two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. I spent every moment with them and I had fun. The problems started when I could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. I failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowballeffect. My selfesteem was in the gutter and I started to hide in my room again. I slowly became me from before that two week vacation. I became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. I could not go to classes. I could not do my homework and I couln't participate in any group activity. I started failing more classes even on subjects that I previously could have aced with my eyes closed. I spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.For the last 67 months I have not been to school at all. I have met doctors and I have met with my guidance counselor for more times then I can count. My anxiety is through the roof and each time I explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor the answer is always We know it is hard for you to go to school because xy and z. You just need to try going to school.Like I had not fucking thought of that before. I am suffering inside my own head thoughts screaming how I cannot do shit and how behind I am going to be and how useless I am. For every day I started crying because I was so afraid of going to school. I could not read anything because I just could not understand the alphabets. I am nearly having panic attacks when I just think about going school. One day I became so enraged that I punched my door hoping that I would break my own arm. But thanks I had not thought of going to school. Right now I have been on summer break again but in a week I need to go back to school but I just do not know how I can. I start crying every time I think about school. I just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. I just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when I have not even started to live independently yet. I am terrified.Any advicestories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.Thanks for reading this far Feeling lost this is my situation,Depression
15157,15177,Honestly I am depressed af lol. The suicidal thoughts have calmed down a little only because I have not been sober for one day. I do not think actually for a hour . I have been drinking to drink myself into a coma tbh. Sadly has not worked cuz I am still here.

25333,25353,I dropped out of college in 2014 following a suicide attempt after dealing with domestic violence at home and in my relationship being broke and without a real home and losing my sense of identity to everything I was trying to be for everyone else. Since then I have done counseling I take my meds I climbed the career ladder at my job and can provide for myself I feel 100 sure of who I am and I would never been better. However to elevate my career to where I want it I need to get my BA with a Graphic Design focus. I am getting registered with my top pick university I have support and I am on the right track. However all of my confidence in myself and my work has flown out the window. I feel like an imposter like I was not meant to have this and like I am destined to fail. I can feel depression creeping in I never feel like doing anything except gaming anymore and I freeze whenever I have to do anything adulty. Some people make this higher education gig look easy and here I am 30 years old freaking out about it. I guess I just really need some support and a sense of community this is my first time posting here...so scary. And any advice would be appreciated as well. Everything's falling into place for me and it is making me feel worse???,Depression

26274,26294,A few weeks ago I lost my parents and both siblings in a car accident. The loss of my entire family has completely ruined me. To make matters worse a month before this happened my girlfriend of 3 years and I broke up and had been struggling a ton with that. I have absolutely no one. I have been in the darkest place imaginable ever since. I have barely slept since and when I do manage a couple hours I wake up with the worst nightmares and a full blown panic attack so bad I feel as if I am having a heart attack. Almost every night I have the most vivid dreams of the accident and of my family telling me how much they miss me. I cannot eat and have lost 30 lbs. I have not been able to go back to work since. I do not know how to continue with life and I do not want to. I have lost everything and my life is withering away day by day. I would not wish this on my worst enemy and remind you all to be grateful for every little thing you have everyday. I am not looking for a pity party. I just have no one to talk to. God help me.

10955,10975,I leave for a week vacation in less than 2 days and I am stuck in a severe depressive episode. Today I have just been so down. I have had no energy felt but then also been very tearful at times. Hyper sensitive bursting into tears after my partner made a comment I took harshly and I ran off and hid and ended up napping for 2 hours. Low appetite ruminating thoughts passive SI. This is so fucking annoying. I am about to be on the beach for a week and here I am crying and cannot bring myself to even pack my damn suitcase.I tried to get my doc to place me on Wellbutrin 4 weeks ago but they did not want to do it since I have been losing weight and am also on Adderall and Topamax. I cannot take an SSRI due to my poor history with them and I was really wanting to give Wellbutrin a shot. I am just feeling so shitty today. I know this will pass but the past 5 days have been awful and I really wanted to feel more excited going into this time away. Vacation countdown but battling a depressive episode,Depression

24772,24792,So I have slowly gained weight over the last few years and am now slightly overweight. I am mostly unconcerned I am 175 cm and 8085 kgs. I am also aware there is nothing wrong with being fat or chubby but I do struggle with my own personal image of myself. I have depression and sometimes I comfort eat a lot. My parents have talked to me several times over the last few years expressing their concern for my weight. They say they are concerned I am going to become like a very obese relative of mine which I think is a huge and ridiculous jump to make. These conversations have left me with a lot of shame and some pain when I comfort eat. Even though my logical brain can see there is nothing to be to worried about my emotional brain feels quite ashamed when I look at my belly my chin or when I am on my way to get some junk food. Tips and thoughts? Shame around comfort eating and weight from parents,Depression

19619,19639,Hey guys. I have basically been in a super stressful bad situation at work which is quite a stressful job in itself would go into details but cannot bring myself to and also do not want to bore everybody for the last 5 months now. I was or thought I was dealing with everything okay until fairly recently when I have realised I have fully moved into depression and suicidal thoughts. I cannot believe how often I have willed myself to sleep forever and never wake up or just wish I did not have friends and family and a boyfriend I loved that I feel are preventing me ending it all. I feel so so so empty. I just want to go away for such a long time and I have felt like this for a few months now and did not realise what this feeling actually was until now. I do not really know why I am posting other than for solidarity and to thank you for this community that I have stumbled across and am already grateful for. For all of us I hope it gets better. This is new to me,Depression
9294,9314,My moms friend how is school going?Me I left actually it was not a good fitFriend so you are not going back ever?Me noFriend oh my god why on earth would you do that??Idk maybe because I failed a class in repeat year which made me deeply depressed which led to more failures when led school to tell me to leave before they kick me out rather than offering support at any point.Not going to say that but omg her statementquestion hurt A small encounter,Depression
18260,18280,Long rant warning.I feel depresssed. After a 3 year break from school i decided i want to make a change for my life to pursue a career as a nurse as i have always wanted to be on a medical team. I fall behind on my studies so i ought to look for tuitions. So now i have a new tuition teacher he is efficient had cultivated lots and lots of A score students.I am always making mistakes its hard for me to understand what they are saying and the teacher encouraged to me it is preasuring us to interact with him otherwise we will not be allowed in class online classes. I do not know how to answer my national language is not as good as the others so i might be blurting out gibberish.He is straight foward and always say that i am wrong. It is a normal and rightful thing to say and i do have to know if i am doing it right or wrong it is his job but my depresssed mind kept interpreting it as disgust because i am older than other students yet am still far behind. When he speaks to me it is very hurtful even though it is beneficial or normal reaction or rightfully or some positive shyt. I felt that my depression sadness and broken heart are irrational and unjustified. It is really hindering me from my studies and possibly future job i have anxiety and just the thought of every thing concerning my studies or my teacher are making me soo sad and heart broken.What do i do? Should i go see a doctor? But my hospital is in lockdown because of the covid outbreak inside it. Should i take a break from my tuition? I do not want to be seen as a coward and run away from my problems i also want to be one of his successful students. If i were to persue in nursing there will be much more harder trials than my teacher correcting me. I am falling apart me falling behind on studies is really making me depressed and despair. I think i could mention to my tuition teacher about my mental illness and take a break again from the tuition until maybe the doctor sorts me out. What do you think? Sorry for the rant. Grateful but feeling sad because of my teacher any advice would help.,Depression
23122,23142,This was posted by me somewhere else as well I just want as many opinions as possible to see if I am wrongTitle says the basics of what I am saying here is the more in depth version. I am still young very young in fact I am 16 and I can already see people saying its too young to make such and assessment but please just hear me out. I cannot talk to girls past a friendship way because I am too scared to. I am offensive and have no filter I say things that I do not mean to harm people then I end up doing so for example one day I could see one of my friends visibly annoyed and when someone asked before my brain could think my mouth said its the time of the month. She was obviously hurt by this and I felt like crap worse than that tbh I felt like a terrible friend. I cannot pick up on social cues if I needed to I could not like for example interrupting people who are talking changing the subject constantly etc. There is one thing I am good at and its reading certain emotions but even then my mouth moves faster than my brain. I am fat unattractive with pimples my hair is a mess because I hate dealing with it I constantly look tired because I am my general demeanor is someone who isint someone attractive or someone anyone is attracted to I am self conscious about my weight so swimming has to be done with a shirt I am not confident I have a lot of problems that if I were to mentionand they would ask about them Id tell them I am fine which would just create a wedge. My interests are what includes staying inside and playing games the only outdoor activity I enjoy is horseback riding. I am constantly annoyed but do not know why and I offer nothing in the way of being confident enough to do anything above a hug. I enjoy being alone but not completely I want someone but that will not happen I have put the reasons on the table and I need help seeing if I am missing something. A few more things of note would be my very minuscule self worth or self preservation my lack of any romantic gestures that show I care and I cannot even articulate that I care about people beyond just saying those words I more than care for people that are really close but its hard for me to articulate that and my feeling as well. Not only that but accedemelally I failed every class this year and have been failing a large amount of classes since 6th grade meaning the one thing Id want to do I cannot accomplish which was to be a game designer thanks for listening sorry for how long it is. I want to someday find someone who likes me but I know it will never happen,Depression

24837,24857,I am a make and I am 16 and I just broke up with my gf. When I was little I was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after I said no. Although I told my close friends what happened they told me I was a loser and that I should have liked it. Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I can still hear there voices telling me I am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. During the relationship I felt like I was more of a therapist than I was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. This made me feel horrible about myself because anytime I did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. We have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. And anytime I would ask my friends if I should break up with her they would say no. But during my last two weeks of school my parents told me I could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. The same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. I broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime I ask for time to myself she would see upset. I hate myself right now and I do not know why. I have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality I am 5 seconds away from breaking down. I do not want to seem emotional because I feel like my friends are just going to tell me I am overreacting and it is not as bad as I am making it. I am scared to tell my parents because I feel like they will see me differently. If anyone could give me some help I would love it or at least some advice on what to do I would love it. Sorry for the long entry. Recently have been thinking about killing myself a lot,Depression

26355,26375,Been struggling for 10 years with depression always somehow managed to function. But it is coming back stronger than ever. I just feel so tired all the time and nothing brings me joy. My plants died my instruments gathers layers of dust and instead of enjoying a game I sit in front of my Playstation and stare into the black until it is time to go to bed. Not that I am able to sleep but I am allowed to lay there.I feel empty. I just started changing my life doing things I had been waiting years for and now that I am able to do this nothing. Just nothing. I somehow wish my house would burn down. Or a car would take pity on me while I cross the street. I do not feel strong enough to make a change. I am a loser that cannot be grateful for anything and I know it could be way worse. But that is not making it easier for me.I am just deadly tired. it is coming back and everything's too much,Depression
15851,15871,My best friend lives about 5 hours of train ride away so we do not often meet. I met him about 2 years ago when I was meeting some online friends. We became friends and remained in contact. In the past 15 years we have became best friends and we basically speakplay games online on daily basis. I know his GF pretty well she sometimes join in to play or just hangs out with us. He and his GF travelled down to the city next to mine so we can meet. It was the best time I have had in such a long time I cannot even remember maybe this was the best weekend of my life. The weekend eventually passed and we all went home. I took a bus home. On the way home I felt a bit down which I contributed to tiredness. When I got home I took a shower and decided to go to a sleep. Then I got really depressed and felt so sad I could not sleep. After a while I started to cry. which really hit me hard because I have not cried in years. Since then I have just been awake and crying from time to time. I know I will speak with him tomorrow after work. I know I will meet him in the future. As a method to cope or ease the pain on a live map where their train are and feel like a fucking stalker now. I do not want to text him because I know he either sleeps or have a good time and I do not want to ruin it for him. I have been depressed for the past few years I have had some bad times in the past but there was nothing I could not get through. But in all that I did not ever feel this sad and depressed. This never happened to me prior to this occasion. This makes no sense to me. Why is this happening? Really depressed after a really good weekend with friends.,Depression

22790,22810,I have all the above mentioned symptoms for past 8 years since i have this problem. I can no longer understand books or comprehend them. I can no longer watch movies cuz its very difficult to absorb the content and quickly follow the plot even with subtitles i miss many things. And my memory is very poor i would walk into a room thinking of some work and after reaching there forget why i came there. Can depression affect our brains like this? Does it makes us really mentally retarded or demented like old people are. Any meds that can help with these symptoms? Any experiences? Thanks Difficulty thinking comprehending understanding remembering.,Depression
21814,21834,lately I have had a hard time feeling things for myself and when I imagine things happening to me its from an outside POV. I suddenly what feels like overnight went from being super happy and healthy to feeling so disconnected and disinterest in most everything in my life. I feel both unattracted and unattractive to my partner leading me to call me sexuality into question but realize I cannot imagine myself with people of the same gender either. I feel so outside of myself! this happen to anyone else? depression and dissociation?,Depression
48015,47997,I wish to be Ill This has probably talked about so many times on here but I dont know where else to turn to about this. I so deeply wish I was terminally ill or had cancer. I want a time limit on my life as Ive just given up Im not healing and Im not declining I dont want to kill my self but Im not exactly happy and thriving either. If I had a time limit I can at least try and enjoy before I have to go and I dont have to let people down by killing myself. If I had the option I would rot in my bed but I keep pushing maybe one day things will get better Im not even a quarter way through my life I dont want people upset or disappointed in me either. But each second I feel my body just weighs more and more to the point I cant even lift my arms and not in the physical sense but life is just a struggle now and being Ill would be a great reason a great excuse. If I had cancer I wouldnt even do chemo I would just accept my fate. I just want this to be over and done with Id be less afraid too. Im horrified of death losing my conscious and it being able to happen at any moment but if I knew Id have a timer things would seem much more easier.,Depression

47773,47757,just something to help cope I think. I've always felt like something was missing in my life. It was a nagging feeling a sense of emptiness that I couldn't shake no matter what I did.But then as I wrote my thoughts and feelings onto the page I felt the presence of someone reading these words. It was as if there was someone out there who was willing to listen to me to understand the things that I had been carrying around for so long.As you continue to read these words unfiltered and unvarnished I feel a sense of hope. Hope that someone out there is willing to spend time getting to know me to understand the thoughts and feelings that I keep hidden from the world.It's a strange feeling to know that someone is reading the things that go through my mind. But it's also incredibly comforting to know that I'm not alone anymore that someone out there cares enough to read what I have to say.I don't feel lonely anymore because I know that you're out there reading these words. It's like we're connected in a way that's hard to explain like we're sharing something special.And so as you continue to read I want you to know that I appreciate you. I appreciate the time you're taking to understand me to think about the things that I'm saying.You're showing me that I'm interesting enough to be worth reading and that means more to me than you could ever know. I feel loved in a way that's hard to explain but it's real and it's powerful.So thank you dear reader for spending this time with me. Thank you for giving me hope for showing me that there's more to life than just the empty feeling that I've been carrying around for so long,Depression
15701,15721,I am 16. Unlike a lot of schools mine has groups for just about everyone because it is huge 3000 students. So you have to be especially weird and a true loser to not have friends. Of course there is people i bullshit with in class but I have not spoken to anyone except my parents in the last 2 months I am afraid to go anywhere with my parents for fear of being seen by someone i know from school and being laughed at. It really hits hardest when I am holed up inside watching SCP videos in my room on a beautiful day. Instead of going out with my friends like literally everyone else I am watching YouTube and working on a summer assignment for AP classes that I would not take if my parents did not demand I work hard in school. They have some delusion that I will be a genius who makes them money. Lol. Honestly SCP is the best fandom for the depressed it let us me forget how boring the world is AND it let us me fantasize about something I would enjoy. The brutal reality is the SCP universe is one of very few fictional universes where people like me matter. In real life being a weird science lover who enjoys thinking about stuff without a deadline ruins your life. Irl Dr. Bright would live in his mom's basement. Man it stings to turn off the YouTube video or close the article tab and remember real life. that is the other thing. I REALLY want to work as hard as I can to avoid being a parasite. I will work as hard as I need to to play video games and watch SCP videos in MY OWN BASEMENT. I am not going to let life disappear while ruining my parents financial state. I am planning to study abroad and emigrate to a country most likely Belgium better suited for 20 year olds to live alone than America. I also hate when people act like I do not enjoy learning. I do. I just hate having to take tests when I will never produce anything of value for all my work. I like to just think about stuff and read interesting things i just hate people forcing me to do it. Sorry I am rambling again. Anyway I have already got an internship as a journalist so I am trying to get the ball rolling on not living in my parents basement. Well time to go bury my head in fiction to forget my shitty life. The best part about SCP? Very few relationships. they are a whole organization full of people like me! Sunday afternoon and the SCP Foundation,Depression

12937,12957,My depression is starting to bleed into every aspect of my life. I have been really good at keeping it hidden to the point that no one even knows I am struggling. I am extremely scared now because I have been getting worse and some of my friends are noticing. I do not know how to deal with what going through and am too scared to talk to anyone about it. I work at a church and I always have on this facade of being a really calm put together person who can handle anything. I do not know what I am looking for here. I just do not know how to talk to anyone about what is going on with me and I do not even know if that is something I should do. I know this post probably is formatted weirdly is kind of jumbled. Sorry about that.. today is a really bad day and I do not have it in me to do anything correctly. I do not know what to do.,Depression
8889,8909,i feel like I am destined to end my own life. I am not going to anytime soon but i just feel like a few years down the line ill have to do it. I am so fucking irresponsible and childish that it only makes sense to check in early. maybe ill kms when I am in college so my roommate can get a 4.0. And i do not get the whole people will miss you shtick. None of that shit'll matter if I am too busy being dead to care. Destined to die young,Depression
11799,11819,I am a disappointment to so many people. My life is shit and I am shit and always will be. Eventually depression will win and that will be it forever.

11412,11432,I am 17F Asian.For my entire childhood my mom has projected her insecurities onto me a behavior which has manifested into relentless cruelty and emotional torture. She used to hit me a lot I still have a scar from when she hurled her keys at my face because I told a friend that she had called me a curse but stopped when CPS came. She has incessantly berated and demeaned me for over a decade to a point of viciousness words cannot describe. whether that is trying to force me to kill myself or calling me a worthless fucking idiot or shrieking at me that I am a maniac who everyone thinks should be locked up the pain she has caused me is indescribable. every single day she terrorizes me with insults comparisons belittling threats and manipulation. and I do not know if I will ever be able to recover from the anguish.but whenever I obey her she is nice to me and acts like a good mother. I know the love is real albeit conditional and it will disappear the moment things do not go her way. but I try so so hard to keep her in a good mood because I just need her affection so badly. I hate myself so much for this.my father is more normal but he has bursts of uncontrollable rage when things do not go his way. I try not to think about these times because other times he loves me very much. I would like to emphasize that he is very kind to me usually. But these outbursts include physical assault smashing stuff death threats suicide threats and really mean comments to me like 'I bet you get orgasms from destroying the family like the sociopath you are'.But that is not very common so I do not want to focus on that. what is more common is his enabling of my moms behavior. he always sat back in silence on his phone whenever my mom was shrieking at me and always pretended it never happened. he never validates my feelings and always jumps to comments like 'nothing will ever satisfy you' and 'your mom does so much for you why are you so ungrateful you bitch'. he always sided with her and her bullshit narrative about the family dynamic essentially I ruined everyone is happiness. It is so frustrating especially when I am begging and crying for him to intervene but he just tells me to shut up and go away and listen to my mother.anyway yesterday my mom was screaming at me as usual because I had not finished a college essay draft. she said something along the lines of how my dad always tells her how he thinks I should be locked up in a mental institution how he wishes he had his friends daughters instead of me and how he cannot wait for me to be out of his life. I felt really sad about this for some reason even though they have said things like this to me since I was 9.My dad was driving me back home from a dr appt today when I for some dumbass reason asked him if what he had said was true. he obviously got very defensive and skirted around the question and claimed I was always searching for stuff to be mad about that I was always blaming my problems on my parents and he did not know what to do to satisfy me. this really upset me as all I want is a loving peaceful family. I will admit it I called him a bad father. I was so angry by him invalidating me and making it look like such a simple request was absurd and ungrateful. I hate how they will always see me as overemotional and dramatic and selfish without ever looking inward and recognizing their flaws. well anyway that made him super mad and he basically said that he hated me and my mom and marrying her was the worst decision of his life that he had stopped loving her years ago and it was all my fault. He said that the family was not worth resurrecting and the only reason he had not left andor killed himself was to preserve his reputation. When I got home I went and cried to my mother and told her she was right that I am a failure and I begged her to hug me. She hugged and kissed me and I felt so much better. She got impatient pretty fast but I did not care. i just wanted someone to love me. I feel so much self loathing for not being strong enough to withstand a family deprived of love. I hate that i am relinquishing my autonomy and purpose and strength just to feel some love from my parents. it sucks. Idk if this is depression or a coping mechanism or what. I do not know how to keep going on. anyway sorry for rant ty for reading if you got this far Both my parents are incredibly cruel to me but sometimes I am so desperate to fill the void I abandon all my morals and appease them so I can get some affection. I viscerally hate myself for this. Is that depression?,Depression
15093,15113,If someone tries to give me emotional support I just feel like a burden and it does not make me feel any happier if they do. And yet I think a part of me desires to have other people be kind towards me. I feel like people should not try to help me because it is a burden on them to try and help and it does not help me emotionally anyways. A part of me desires to experience the kindness of others and another part of me feels that experiencing kindness will not do anything for me and is not worth the trouble. Any advice for me? Also I do see a therapist I just want to hear some other opinions I am confused about emotional support,Depression
19166,19186,I constantly have moments where I do not feel like I am inside my own body I feel like I am seeing myself from someone elses perspective like I am not really there. I feel as if nothing around me is real like everything is fake. What is real? I do not know. Is this normal? Nothing feels real anymore,Depression
11167,11187,Just needed to vent and I honestly cannot say this to anyone IRL. The bar is this coming Tuesday. I have not studied in any capacity. I just could not bring myself to commit. I was barely taking care of myself as it was. And that is the thing I cannot even say that I want to kick myself or that I regret it. My mental health was literally just so poor that if I actually participated in the study schedulegrind I feel I would have been worse off for it. For context this summer is the only time I have gone days without brushing my teeth and struggled to get out of my bed. I have had two major depressive periods in the past and neither time was I at this level of neglect. I wish I would have just signed up for the later date but that is not what you are suppose to do. You are supposed to graduate and immediately study fulltime for 8 weeks. I even started early technically but I put in one full days worth of work and just...stopped. I said oh after graduation when its official to start is when Ill pick it back up...but I did not. And very early on I already felt like I was so behind. I had people asking me what my progress percentage of my bar prep course was at during graduation we did not even need to technically start yet!! and it freaked me out. I basically decided at the beginning of July that I was too behind with only 4 weeks left so it was not possible and I was going to fail. And I gave up even pretending to schedule studying.Part of the issue iswas covid. I felt like a real law student with real obligations benefits and consequences before this. Then we went online for the remainder of my degree program. I instantly lost focus and drive. None of it felt real or worthwhile anymore. I could now BS my way through my classes school had relaxed grading policies and when it came time to actually learn for the bar I was incredibly overwhelmed.And hell even if I studied studied there was never a guarantee that I would pass but there is absolutely no chance for me to pass now. I do not care what any of my peers have to say about me not passing because well I did not actually study and regardless of that peer pressure just has not ever been a motivator for me. I wish I did care what they thought in actuality because I am completely lacking motivation. My family is truly supportive and I know already they will not think badly of me. But they have checked in practically everyday. And I lie and say I studied when I did not. I cannot tell my friends because I know they all are studying by the stuff they send me. All this to say I feel very alone at this time in my life.I cannot back out of the exam now so I am treating it like a practice test as I have heard others suggest. I can and will retake it next year. I already know that I am changing my environment so I will not be so isolated which will help. I know in the end everything will probably be okay. I think it speaks loads that even as I am writing this with the test days away I do not have that much anxiety. This entire time I have been numb. I am sure I will probably freak out during the test. I hope that this experience will actually motivate me in the end. If you read all this thanks for listening. I am going to fail the bar exam,Depression
13881,13901,The summer before 8th grade is when the symptoms started hitting. I have always been a fairly airheaded chatty upbeat person on the surface. Actual anger discomfort or sadness are things that i just do not express. I sorta just sat at the corner of friend groups and never shared my deep thoughts...that is to say i was sorta just someone to have casual friendly conversation with. I am often left out of things that my circles do only to find about how much fun they had when they chat endlessly to me about it.Due to a lot of factors I essentially just had a mental collapse at the end of the summer and the start of 8th grade. I would put on my happy facade at school and then go home and quietly cry or just zone out. I started selfharming at that time too and i made sure to do it in places that were easy to hide.I was also pretty aware of how people romanticize depression or fake it and i used to obsessively tell myself that I was faking it. That the selfharming was for attention even though i desperately hid it. I felt like others would think the same about me if i told them and that terrified me.I eventually started to accept that the symptoms that i was experiencing were real around August of 2020 a full year after shit hit the fan and around November i started to have really intense suicidal thoughts. My grades slipped. I went from being high functioning to laying in bed all day feeling like there was nothing to live for. My parents would only berate me for my slipping grades which made me feel like i could not tell anyone even more. I made a full plan to finally do it and tested out my chosen method. I started writing suicide notes in my head. And i had no friends to turn to because none of them knew and i did not want to inconvenience them with my stupid emotions.I finally reached out to my doctor as a lastditch effort at the start of this year and when she told my parents it only caused my mom to temporarily pity me and my dad to get angry...and then they acted like it never happened. I do not think I will do that again lolI psych myself out sometimes because i hit these lengths where I feel somewhat average. Not exactly happy or content but i do not feel like dying 247 and my immediately reaction to everything is not an intense urge to off myself oh god that sounds so edgy but my kneejerk reaction literally just becomes fucking do it whenever i feel like I have messed up so then I tell myself that there is no reason to tell anyone anymore. Inevitably I always fall back into the same dark space but oh well.I just cannot reach out or tell my friends because I do not want to bring anyone down. If i have any true goal in life that will give me any peace its to make people as happy and content as possible. If people find out I feel like I will just drag everyone down. I am always the upbeat one in groups the one that people laugh at because i do stupid shit but I feel like that whole act will be ruined. Nobody will want to be around meIts been 2 years and almost nobody knows...and nobody probably will ever know. I have basically accepted that I will eventually recover alone or kill myself before i do.I am sorry that this is probably super melodramatic. Its been 2 years and almost nobody knows,Depression

Why am I even trying? it is exhausting trying to gain the energy I need from food and exercise and work but ending up drained of it and starved for it anyway. I was having a slow day. Now it is turning into a bad day. I feel mocked by these customers. I feel disregarded by my coworkers. I feel attacked by the company that does not see me as a person just a robot that follows orders and works hard so they can pay me less. I feel I am losing my identity. I do not want to be me anymore because who cares? Who cares about who I am? What I like? What I want? I am tired...I am tired of trying. it is so hard to resist giving up. My depression is a loud voice that commands me to just throw in the towel and lose. To lose like the loser I am. Why try succeeding if you will only ever lose?...I am not enough. I am not alive. I am so tired. I just want to go home and sleep for a week... Saying I am tired when I am actually tired but then I start to feel depressed and now I am even more tired...while also feeling totally empty inside.,Depression
17005,17025,I am not special...The medical industry makes a fuck load of money because both feed the narcissism that life is precious. The orthodontic and medical community are vultures and religion sells a fantasy. The science industry controls religion which is humans but when you fall within that bracket it makes your life very limiting. The medical industry is attempting to remove our flaws and imperfections so that they feed it to the next generation.Pretty sure that all these diseases are manmade or discovered and then released so they can inject fear and then we keep paying them money for the cure to ensure that we become weak and not question this system.Whether you go into porn or any other industry it is rigged and the minute you think you are free it gets taken away from you.The world I want is something I will not ever get so fuck hope. Why bother with life when the narcissist rule the world? I am not special...,Depression

47855,47838,Im only at peace when slumber is reached so perhaps if I flee Id finally happen to be free. Is eternal slumber the key? Little suicidal poem to express myself since Im an anxious depressed wreck questioning if living is worth it.If you dont get it its basicallyIm only at peace when slumber is reached Im only at peace when sleeping.So perhaps if I flee Id finally happen to be free If I killed myself maybe Id finally be free and be at peace 247.Is eternal slumber the key? Is death the solution to my problems?ampx200BI dont know if I should elaborate on my problems or not I doubt anyone would care enough to read all of them and in the end getting told that someone is sorry for what happened to me doesnt really do much I appreciate the words none the less but I dont think anything will ever make me feel better. Ive gotten into this hole of depression and anxiety over and over and over it never stops itll never leave me alone not unless Im asleep or dead.,Depression

47569,47553,I wish I wasnt like this I am a 19 year old student in college studying in computer science who despite being in his 4th semester is still stuck in the 2nd. I am unable to make any lasting connections with any other students Ive met during those semesters. The only people i talk too are people i have been friends with in high school and their friends. This is our last semester together has the have chosen a preUniversity to then follow their ambitions and have the job they wanted. I have become so tired and hopeless that i am just barely following the classes anymore and recently I started not going to any of them if its one of those days. I never thought i would make it past 16 honestly and im even more surprised that I havent gotten to courage to attempt to end myself again.I am just so tired of all of this All the things that I used to love means literally nothing to me I keep getting overwhelmed by everything at the middle of the semester I keep self sabotaging so bad that i just lay in bed all day or do nothing productive at all. Ive never seen myself in a future where I could be happy with the others and Ive lost all my hopes and dreams. Over the years i have developed the worse eating habits as well as letting my negative self talk become louder and louder to the point when sometimes when I wake up Im already defeated by it so I see no point in getting out of bed or do anything at all. Why even bother if its pointless anyway.I dont even get why I am becoming like this. I barely understand how I feel how think or what the hell I am even doing.I thought I could prove my thoughts wrong by proving that I could do stuff but Im coming close and closer to accomplishing another self fulfilling prophecy each time thinking about death being the only way out of this since its the only way to stop existing.Although I think this is true I know deep down that its also a lie. I envy those who can just wake up go through life and enjoy it. Idk how they do it but I wish I could experience it. Just being alive for once being human without ruining everything that I do. I want to be able to convey emotions again cry instead of blocking all of this sadness in my throat without having to bottle everything up until I breakdown be angery at stuff due to how wrong some of them are be happy and have way more better days than what I am having rn and laugh at how everything is just absurd with other people. I dont want to stay as this subhuman filth that I have become but every step I take takes me to nowhere so I am just here standing still while watching everything else moving forward.,Depression
8456,8476,so I would just like to ask a favour of some people. I want to ask my Mum if I can go and see a therapist so can somebody please just tell me some things that I could say to try and persuade my Mum to let me see a therapist at my local doctors? I was thinking of some of the good times of my childhood where I was not screaming and crying internally. Where I was laughing with joy instead of my own pain. Where I was not self harming myself. They were good times... Hey,Depression
12217,12237,I have suffered from depression since I was little I have been physically sexually and mentally abused and tortured since the age of 4 . At 13 I physically was taken away from these problems and pulled out of the home and had to go to court and face these people again. At 15 I broke down completely started failing school and getting out of control . I would still have nightmares about what happened to me everyday of the summer . Last year I was so depressed and traumatized I had to get help . I started crying everyday not one day goes by I do not cry I hate going to sleep because of nightmares sometimes . I done cried so much my eyes has now recently become permanently low when I look into my eyes I do not have soulful eyes as people in the older days call it like I used to . For the past 2 weeks I cannot cry easily I have to force myself to cry and be extra hurt or sometimes I cry with little tears. Its like my body needs a break from tears . I am just so sad I am not happy I just pray God does what is best for me Am I crying too much? F19,Depression

8564,8584,I just went through a breakup and the girl wants to stay friends and I want to so I do not hurt her but I know how painful it will be for me. We were better off as friends and now I cannot even be one becuase I still have feelings and it hurts so much. I do not know what to do here I am considering blocking her on everything and having no contact with her until I can get over her but I know that will hurt her. I also try to think all the negative things in order to lose feelings but still it is not working. I am so sad and scared I do not know what to do I need some advice,Depression

11268,11288,Everything is awful. I hate my body I hate my voice I hate how I am so apathetic I hate how I constantly feel and think. I feel like screaming but I do not have the energy to do it because its pointless.I made an actual friend for once and I fucked it up. It finally felt good to be alive but all things must end I guess. I feel like she never wants to talk to me and I never know what to say anyway. And I tried talking to her and she just kind of brushed it off. I just want to die. There is no point to any of this. I will constantly be in pain and nothing will ever save me. Life is meaningless. I am shut an awful human,Depression

12318,12338,I have had severe depression in the past and I am currently on antidepressants too. I also have a lot of reasons as to why I would be depressed breakup death of a pet trouble at home etc. but I just feel strangely... apathetic? I have all the other symptoms of depression like tiredness loss of apatite loss of interest scatter minded....I just feel like I have lost a part of me. The part that wants to make the world a better place the part that fights for what it what is the part that cannot wait to change the world.Food disgusts me and I am constantly tired. Not too tired to get through the day but too tired to do the things I love.So basically I have all my usual symptoms of depression but I am just not sad. I am still moving forward with my life I am taking steps for my future. I have even taken up dating again. I do not get knocked down as hard anymore when something happens I get sad for a while but then I still manage to get back up again. But I feel so... toned down. I do not feel like me anymore. it is a strange feeling and I cannot quite put my finger on what it is or why it is. I think I am depressed but I just do not feel sad?,Depression
16171,16191,they do not understand amp sadly no one will ever understand. one last try life. if i fail again like i always do then I am officially out. I have given them a good amount of my years.

I am going to try one last time for them. if i fail well at least i tried so they can shut up.,Depression
38489,38486,i don t want to fight cause i know that won t work and i also know it s odd because they touch my poofy big curly hair probably because i m a guy and also when i sneeze they laugh and stuff and just say stuff like oh covid kid with the lion mane is spreading covid when in reality it s just my severe allergy,Depression
17297,17317,Everything in my life feels weird I am happysad all the time and productive but also burnt out I could keep going about how I feel like there is a direct contrast between most aspects of my life but I want to keep this relatively short.Honestly I am just writing this to get the thoughts off my chest because I know I will probably forget about this tomorrow. I do not know if i have any mental illness but from what I have heard my symptoms are closest to depression. I am 18 and i feel like I have the perfect life but I have never been able to enjoy it. I do not know where the constant sadness goes or anything. I went to a great high school and did well academically and had a decent amount of friends and a great friend group. Alright that is the context and I will now get into the depression symptom stuff. I have had thoughts that align with nihilism since i was like 13. I have this constant battle that feels like it is going on in my head between happiness and sadness. I have what feels like euphoric episodes that last a few days so maybe that is just happiness? Idk but it does not really last. Every good phase I have comes with a crashing low that drains me and leaves me with my thoughts and I do not know how I get out of it but it just a cycle. I do not fit into what I always thought depression was as I an able to be productive and do really well but I just burn out after. I cannot find any interests for most of the time and then i get super hyper focused on something and it feels like it is my calling in my life. I think I had been numbing my thoughts for nearly a year and just tried to think no thoughts and it worked but it left me feeling stupid as shit. I do not know how I return to how I used to be when I was less depressed or whatever or if I even can. I might add more to this and explain more but this is just all the thoughts that are running through my head. I do not know what I am looking for out of this post but if you want to say anything feel free to.Also is it normal to think this is all in my head? Like I am manifesting it or doing it to myself or something I feel like an oxymoron,Depression
38666,38663,everyday is so hard i feel like everyone is fake and everybody think i m stupid or weirdo i ve been bullied alot mainly because i m quiet introvert what people use against me and abuse me feel like every friend or relative think i m nothing i m a failure just stupid it s so hard to live with myself,Depression

24167,24187,ampx200BI am a 26 year old exhibiting clear signs of Parkinsons. Every day I feel my cognition along with my ability to concentrate decline. I have bouts of dizziness and am struggle to keep up with work. I am not half the person I was just a couple years ago and I know I will soon reach the point where I am unable to work. It is only a matter of time till my declining cognition will expose me at work and that may lead me to getting fired. I do not think I have it in me to get another job. I am not the same person that was originally hired.Cognition is only half the picture. I have increasing stiffness in my legs and it is inevitable that I will get to a point where I will struggle to walk. I do not really know what I have to look forward to. Sure I work my butt off to get enough money to survive but what happens next ? A life of struggling to do the most basic things ? Become a burden to my parentsfamily ? I t is morally wrong for me to get married have children knowing that I have this condition. I cannot fathom put such a large burden on anybody. These are thing that I have I always looked forward to and it hurts me deeply that I will never obtain these.I am basically a zombie amongst the living. I just eat like a pig try to set myself up to survive do not really care about much and just try to enjoy my limited time with loved ones. But living in the moment is not easy with the lingering disease. I am not suicidal as I would not be able to do something like that to my family. As long as I have an obligation to my family I will always be around try to be there for them and enjoy my time with them.I would not wish this horrible fate on anybody where everything someone does is pointless. That brings me to my original question. How do I cope with having no future ? How to cope with having no future ?,Depression
25641,25661,I have an appointment with a GP tomorrow however just want some opinions.I weaned off my antidepressants maybe 6 8 weeks ago without supervision and it is been awful physically and mentally. After a tipping point last night I have decided to go back on the meds. I have tried my best to wait it out but I cannot keep this up. I was on desvenlaflaxine generic Pristq 150mg which is a higher dose for this med. Should I go back to 150mg? Or start from scratch at 50mg? Or meet in the middle at 100mg?Thank you in advance.I know I should not have weaned off on my own but my GPs plural I have seen multiple understanding of mental health treatments are basic at best and I thought I could manage it myself. I was wrong. Moving on now. Restarting antidepressants start with lower dose?,Depression
16450,16470,I have been feeling really really low again for the past few weeks. Today I woke up at 1 and have not gotten out of bed. its now 4... I started thinking about killing myself so I wrote a letter for my gf to have incase I did and it kind of helped me in a way. Describing why I did it in past tense gave me a realization that the problems in my life are either stuff I should not care about or are not as bad as I think. I even laughed at myself sometimes. Because the whole time I was writing I was trying to justify why I did what I was planning to do to someone who I care about more than anything and none of them were justified enough to hurt her that much. writing my suicide note gave me relief. made me feel like everything was ok. It even made me able to get started on my new captioning job and make some money. But is this healthy? Are suicide notes a healthy coping method?,Depression

27022,27042,Fuck dude. This always happens. I feel like the Eiffel Tower of mental health. Build myself back up and once I get to the top it just all crashes down so quickly around me. Maybe I hope for too much. Maybe I am too optimistic when I am happy. The more I try the more it hurts when I fall back down to this awful reality m. Fuck this day. Fuck this life. I just want it to end dude. I was doing so well.,Depression
39332,39329,yesterday i noticed puncture wound on my thigh i m actually not really sure what they are they could be abrasion wound i might have scratched there but i can t remember but of course i ve been fixated on bat ever since i heard you might not feel a bat bite i ve been very afraid of them i know i m probably ok like 99 sure but that like a bat might have gotten under my cover bit me then flew out and disappeared is just freaking me out and i thought my toe leg felt a little tingly tonight so i just can t sleep health anxiety is so unreasonable,Depression
21704,21724,I want to get away from my family because I feel like that is the only way I can feel at peace but at the same time I feel too ugly and weird to go out and be independent so I am stuck being dependent on my mom. I feel too weak to survive in this world like I never should have been born. Everyday I just stay in my room wasting my life away but I feel too disgusted at myself to go out. I wish I could experience life being normal. I have no real life experience so I do not even know where to start and I honestly have no motivation to live or do or learn anything. I hate my family so much I feel like if I got along with them then my life could have been happier but they are so different from me so that makes me feel even lonelier like everyday is just so pointless. I could never be truly happy but at the same time I am not sure I want to die. I suck at writing but I just do not know where else to say all this. I am just so lost Idk what to do with myself,Depression

7116,7136,I do not remember what a hug feels like anymore. Everyone I know would benefit from it and you would just be doing them a service. Please just do everyone in my life a favour and take out the trash.

Please just kill me,Depression
9105,9125,I relocated for my graduate scheme with my fiance I have no friends here. My only 2 best friends live a while away and are busy. My university friends take no interest in me and have their own lives now. Work makes me anxious and lonely. I feel trapped in an endless loop of work home sleep repeat and my life feels pointless with no accomplishments. I have my fiance whom i adore but he struggles too with depression so its hard to discuss together. I worry we will end up breaking up because of our mental health or because sometimes it just happens but we have a new puppy together a mortgage and are getting married in a few years. I do not want to be alone forever and I love him but still the worry keeps me up at night that one day I could wake up and it will all be gone.I just think I am too weird or anxious to make friends I feel like a loser and see mutuals posting on socials with their friends all the time makes me wonder why I cannot have that.No point to the post just a word vomit situation. Friendless,Depression

9197,9217,I have probably averaged 5 meals per week this year all of which were delivery. Eating much less making food is just exhausting. I am not anorexic I wish I could eat and weigh more.

19810,19830,It seems like it is impossible to get appointments without getting a private therapist who are expensive af. Free services like the suicide hotline forums etc can help but are not long term solutions. Medications can be expensive with or without insurance. It seems like so many people wanting help just get ignored. Then we are blamed for having breakdowns self harming and suicide. Sucks Why are mental health care services so inaccessible?,Depression

47969,47951,Is Anger a New Level of Depression? I 28F have chronic depression but until two years ago I dealt with it more or less good. In the past couple of years I have experienced a lot of things that can be sand and other traumatic and emotionally exhausting. At this point of my depression or life I'm starting to get upset and mad. I just get annoyed I have violent impulses when never in my life I have been a violent person on the contrary I'm always super peaceful and conciliatory. But now at any inconvenience I want to break windows I want for people to stop calling me resilient I want to punch walls and scream. My therapist which was great at teaching me how to deal with things in healthy manners now seems annoying and making me feel like being upset is not healthy and it might not but at this point I'm exhausted of feeling sad or defenseless or disappointed.,Depression
40653,40650,she s guilt tripping him for feeling good about himself she s saying he s the reason for her sadness and she s missing a version of him where he wa at his lowest she didn t even see the depression that lived in her husband because it made her comfortable,Depression

16815,16835,Sometimes something so profound happens in life that a drastic change is required. A complete and total system reboot and reprogramming. Such is my story and in that same sense it is akin to trying to extract blood from a turnip.Many people try to convince me that I am no lesser that I am just as human as they are. The unfortunate truth is that I am not I am nothing like you I could never be like you.I cannot whisk myself away into some fantasy reality where everything will be okay. I cannot lie to myself and say that I will change. I know what it would take for me to change yet I know that change would only be temporary. I know I will end up exactly where I am as I am today.It brings to light just how magnificent you humans truly are. I still cannot even begin to grasp how you do the things you do almost without even skipping a beat.It amazes me that people still even try to relate to a thing like me or try to be compassionate towards me. I am just a freak a monster. I do not deserve any of it yet people persist. it is awe inspiring truly.To whatever extent there may be a fraction of hope that remains within the hollowed out tusk of the human I was born as. Unfortunately words could never fill that void. Not even compassionate kind encouraging words.The damage is done and I am far too aware of it to deny the overwhelming reality of it all. I am here because of me I cannot blame it on anyone else.Why would I take my pain and put it out into the world? All I have to do is simply be present and people feel it. They become more aware of the threat I am. I have always compared it to having a neon sign on my forehead and to that extent I suppose I should be grateful.At least people saw me for what I really am and made the right decision in avoiding me. that is reality.I have tried to play some role in this world and no matter what I just never fit. that is reality. I am so cold towards myself because it is all I have ever been shown on any consistent basis. Sure every once in a while someone tries to show some sense of connection and it often results in both of us getting hurt or leaving with hurt feelings and regret.that is just what it is to deal with me. I do not know why it is or what causes it it is just there. I try my best to circumvent the issue by being more understanding and kind and compassionate but even that is not enough to really outweigh the impact I have on others. It is still true that I am like a bad omen of sorts. I bring bad luck to those who come near me.that is just reality. that is my reality. I just do not want to push that on anyone anymore. I used to desire connection love belonging. But life has always had other plans for me.I am the outlier an ever watchful eye that sees the beautiful treasures of humanity. But I will never find my way into that vault I will never find my place amongst the most precious commodity. There is no space there for me that is reality.But I can still admire just how beautiful you humans truly are even as a monster. The Monster Who Grew a Heart,Depression
10537,10557,I am 21 years old. I have not been diagnosed with depression but I am pretty sure there is something wrong with me. The thing is I feel unhappy many times and its been a very long time since I truly felt happy. I do not even remember when was the last time that I did feel happy. I do not feel like I enjoy anything anymore not when I watch tv not when I read a book not when i get good grades. I cry many nights and there is never a particular reason for it. But I never told my psychologist any of this because at first I thought it would go away and now I am just scared. I feel like everything I do is just because I am supposed to do it like being good at college trying to lose weight and be healthy practicing to get better at some hobby etc. but I just do not feel happy. And I do not know what do about it. I also feel like I am so lame to be around lately because I never have anything interesting to say never have a story to tell. I am just tired.

9695,9715,I am sitting here after my first week of my new job I got a raise but I am not excited. I scrub toilets now.. my car was carjacked about 2 months ago with me in it a month after purchasing it.. throwing myself from the vehicle we lost everything we had with us phones bags some identity etc... after 8 months ago my last vehicle was stolen from my apartment complex one morning .....a week after purchasing it.. This is no exaggeration. And you may not know me.. I was a full time college student till covid 19 forced me to drop out due to my learning disability preventing me from taking online courses the school had switched to all online learning and I have fallen behind due to fear of affecting my grades and learning opportunities.. also not having a car was not going to work.. I was going to school for medicine sociology and criminology. I want to be a surgeon or a drug rehab specialist with a psychology major.. I also act and model and make music for my dreams.. I want to change the world and bring my creations to millions to enjoy but also learn from and be strong from. To inspire.. i want to be a good person I I a good person and I do not understand why everything is so dark.everything is against me. I am so tired... one thing after the other. . I can barely stand waking up in the mornings.. I bought blades and lidocaine because I am just tired. I am falling back into my had habits like not eating and obsessive little habits are creeping back into my life.. I am having nightmares and I can barely hear what people are saying to me.. delayed reactions and my slouching is worse than ever and I can feel it hurting me but I cannot care enough to force myself to try and sit up. it is starting to make my GI issues worse yet I cannot convince myself.. I am sick and disgusting every day. My GI issues are annoying and make me feel like scum..I cannot even go days without vomiting or getting sick from stomach acid and weak.. My mom is basically killing herself slowly. She drinks 2 pints a day and chain smokes and is currently suffering from some sort of internal bleeding while skipping a surgery she needed last year and is counting on death. I am left to clean up the messy house when she does not and the bills have fallen behind to an absolute bomb.. I am 23 and I am the head of house hold.. I cannot do this anymore. Her old abusive narcissistic habits come out when she is drunk and she snaps at me or shuts me down. And my whole body shuts down I feel stupid and like I am not myself when she triggers those old things.. I was homeless last year 2x and before was evicted from our family home when my mom divorced her fiance of 15 years one night in the garage he then got us kicked out of our home because he was so vindictive. And now he is keeping my brothers away from my mom and me. We have not seen them except maybe 4 times this year when the court order says they have to be here a of the week. My boyfriend is ignoring me every day now.. after I spent nights with him holding his head up scared of him O.Ding.. he pops in and out and now will not listen to me when i complain about what needs to be fixed.. he will not visit me when his father said he would be fine witv taking him to my house while he is at work so he could spend a few hours over here every other day.. but has never once taken the offer.. he did not show up for my birthday.. or our anniversary and I am falling apart. As I write this I feel suicidal and he is not here for me.. our date was tonight but I have not spoke to him in 15 hours.. he did not even tell me we were not doing to today and now I am just hurt because i did not even get an update. And he was not even going to be actually seeing me he said it would be a virtual date. But we live in the same state and he is treating me like a long distance Xbox girlfriend... My friends left the state and I have been canceling projects.. I have been laying in bed sad and barely eating.. even the weed is not helping. I hate myself. I cannot even remember what I look like on a good day and looking in the mirror is unbearable covered in scars and cannot even finish school. I cannot even keep a car or keep my partner interested in me. I am a whiney fuckinf bitch. I feel CRAZY because I cannot tell if my partner is stringing me along or actually just going through something.. and I feel like I am mean and wrong for feeling the way I do. Like I cannot even speak to him because he does not even look at me when I tell him he is not being very attentive to me or the relationship.. sometimes he does not kiss me when I ask or pulls away from me.. we have not had sex in almost 10 months it was one reason and now it is another.. but he is asked a girl in the past for inappropriate photos.. if he was excited to see some random photo why cannot he be excited for me what is wrong with me.. he does not even touch me like he used to.. I cannot even call him he does not ever pick up for my phone calls when i call him.. he even tells me he lost his phone some times... he does not work he does not go to school he plays Xbox and never leaves his mom.home and plays with online friends? But is too depressed to talk to me i feel like I am the problem and everyone hates meI'm honestly just not wanting to be here any more and it is really starting to hurt me.. it is like the world is pushing me to take my life and I am really starting to believe it.. I was supposed to fucking die as an infant maybe it is true have not felt this low in a while..,Depression
21359,21379,All this time all I was doing is clinging onto some fake hope hoping that my ex will come back to me when I know for a damn fact that she are not but some how I still hope. I cannot help my damn self anymore. it is just chaotic and a mess inside me. I need to move on but I still hope for what?! I just need to replace her but why is it so hard? I just want someone to be here and love me accept me for all of my mistakes and mess. Why is it so hard for people to understand that this is not what I wanted to be. That this is not my decision. Is it just me or that people out there are refusing to understand what it is like to be other people. Please someone save me. I am beyond fixable,Depression

9832,9852,People are so mean. they are awful. They hurt lie kill steal manipulate whatever you can think of. The world is so messed up. I do not want to be apart of it anymore. The bad outweighs the good at this point. I do not want to try and find the good anymore because everywhere I look there is murder suicide rape fighting stealing etc. and I do not want to deal with it anymore. The world is so cruel. I do not want to fight for life. I am not strong enough to. there is so much wrong in the world and there is nothing I can do to fix it. I wish I was never brought into this terrible place. I want to leave. I do not want to be around anymore.,Depression

Nobody will even listen to the damned thing but that hardly matters because I am too drained to even complete it.Had so much awful shit happen to me a year ago and just have not been able to recover since. The trauma still gets to me. Alcohol is keeping me afloat and has been for a long long time. I miss motivation,Depression

10140,10160,I am thinking of killing myself because I am so useless I have no talents skills I am ugly fat. My mom is dissapointed at me and my dad hates me. And I think my friends are starting to hate me. This past 4 years of my life I think I tried everything so that my parents can be proud of me. I started to study hard and got good grades like really good grades next I tried to be fit and be more active again. But nothing really changed my parents looked even more dissapointed at me. I do not know what to do anymore. I cannot open up to my parents because they would be more dissapointed plus they would not care on what I say. that is why I think dying is the best solution.I am sorry if my grammar is bad or my story is a bit confusing its just I can think straight at the moment I am so Useless,Depression
19864,19884,I made a brief post in another subreddit outlining the human condition and the response I got was essentially My life is good so fuck you.Bluntness is met with indignation.Most forums like these are populated l with personal anecdotes where attention empathy and especially solutions are sparse.Its too late for me now anyway. I do not even know why I write anymore. Why are we not allowed to accurately express the conditions of reality?,Depression
39099,39096,i am pretty sure i have a porn addiction in particular i find myself drawn to the casting type video my therapist and i have discussed that seeing amateur and novel stimulus is sexually stimulating especially for someone who ha searched for porn all their life i d like to think that i am not hurting anyone besides myself in consuming this porn but i experience urge to watch girlsdoporn if you are not familiar many girl within this casting channel were coerced into filming and were essentially assaulted on screen i know morally that i should not watch these video and i always am able to stop myself but i am just so so ashamed that i have to seek validation on google is it wrong to watch gdp in order to stop myself to me it feel a though i need google to reaffirm my moral i just feel so weak when i am horny and after i am horny i just feel this terrible guilt am i a horrible person who view woman a nothing a sexual object am i so far removed from the concept of empathy that seeing woman possibly being assaulted is le important than satisfying my sexual urge how do you all view this situation do i pose a threat to those around me i feel a terrible shame but these feeling seem to almost evaporate when i m in that mood therapy and med have helped but i need to kick this habit and i don t want to hurt anyone i also feel that future relationship would be ruined if they were to find out about my blatant disrespect for woman,Depression

22021,22041,Hi.About a month ago I was put on a standard dose of nortriptyline. Since then I have noticed I am waking up very early and unable to get back to sleep. I am lucky if I get 6 hours a massive change from my usual 9 or 10.I have been on a lot of antidepressants before and none have ever had this effect on my sleep. Is this something common to antidepressants or nortriptyline specifically? Or is this problem unrelated to the new medication?Thanks for any helpanswers. I will be seeing my psychiatrist in a few weeks so will bring it up with him as well. Can antidepressants because early awakenings?,Depression
22878,22898,A few months ago I would be making yet another post on this subreddit. I was at my lowest. To get to that point of my life the point of my life where I literally wanted to end it I had years of social isolation an adolescence scarred and stolen from me by bullying that left me with PTSD and being too scared to leave my own fucking house being diagnosed with aspergers and depression put on medication and coming literally to the edge of life and death. And you know what? I survived. I am a survivor. I have come to the realisation that there literally is nothing left in life that can frighten me. No height too high. No space too small. No flight too bumpy. No bully too big. I fear nothing but fear itself. The thing that has scared me the most? My emotions. Being so traumatised so low that I felt I had nothing to live for. Has anything changed? Not really. I still have no friends. I am still a confused screwed up teen well young adult I am 18 now who'se still yet to experience anything you would expect from someone that age still unemployed and still just as restless as ever. But what has changed? I embraced the mindset of a survivor. I stopped viewing myself as a victim. That is not to say I am a victim. I have been treated horiffically an outcast by the society around me for my entire adolesence. But if I can survive years of loneliness being bullied relentless for months on end effectively imprisoned for fear of being attacked when I went out night upon night of waking up in pools of sweat reliving the terror I experienced or might experience in the future being on the edge of life and death I can survive anything. This is the only positive thing I have posted on here. Probably one of the few positive things on here. My advice? Stop reading or posting on this subreddit until you are in a better place. it is filled with very angry very desperate and sad people like how I was and let us face it I still have days like that wallowing in an echo chamber where their worthlessness is projected to thousands of other likeminded people who believe that they too are equally worthless. If things have got that bad in your life that you thought about ending it and you did not then you are a survivor too. everyone is pain tolerance threshold is different and if you did not give into that voice that told you you were better of dead you have survived. My journey has only just begun. I am not sure where exactly the road I am on is taking me but hopefully it is somewhere better than the place I have been at for the last several months. It might be a long sometimes bumpy ride but I will get there. One way or the other. Because I am a survivor. I am a survivor.,Depression
14904,14924,Have you ever met someone and thought to yourself Hey even after all I have been through i take my chances and go for it?So i met this girl on badoo. 20 I am 23 lots of same opinions and really enjoyed time we spend together.

7908,7928,I have been living alone for about 8 years now. My main source of socializing came from going into the office but that is pretty dead now and most people want to work from home. Also the work is shit now so I am trying desperately to change jobs.there is a lot of different issues happening all at the same time and giving me massive stress. Throughout all of this I am trying to combat PTSD and doing everything in my power to not self harm or jump straight to suicide. I kill the thoughts immediately.ButI'm slipping. I have to give a little bit in some areas to compensate for others. And I keep having to do it so now the thoughts become longer and more enticing and grip me.I am so fucked right now I cannot even self mock and laugh about it. I have been trying to cry and it does not work. Quick one,Depression
17046,17066,I have never made a post. This is a wide arc for me but something in me just wants someone else to know. I hate this fuck of a human that is me. I scream and beg whatever god is almost daily to just end it already. I have been diagnosed bipolar. And with every episode I have it adds to the mountain of self hate. No shock I grew up in a violent and horrible home. My bio father drowned when I was 9 months old. My mom was 19 and a disaster mostly from her violent alcoholic upbringing but also from his death. All our family holidays and vacations were filled with anger and violence. Mom and stepdad always fighting. I know some of what I am is because of that childhood but more of me is worthless because of my own inability to understand manage treat or care for this depression in me that over time has turned to hatred. I hate myself for being unable to heal unable to grow unable to even kill myself. I am dependent on others even for that.Its all poison and there is no one to tell. The sickness in me somehow wants to believe that this post is helpful in my healing but that is shit. Its hard to honestly help someone you genuinely hate. It gives me claustrophobia to live with this fucker. I beg god to end me everyday,Depression
8540,8560,I am so sick and tired of everything. Everything drains my mind. Whether I am momentarily happy or sad. Nothing satisfies me anymore. I have lost interest in the shows I used to watch I make music but even that seems bleak and pointless at the moment. I cannot get myself to commit suicide but I really wish this life comes to an end. When I walk down the road I wish that a vehicle runs me over. When I am riding my bike I wish I come across an accident and die. When I sleep I wish that peacefully pass away. I do have aspirations and goals in mind but honestly I do not think I have the mental capacity to endure through. I wish I had what it takes to take my own life.,Depression
11967,11987,Long post incoming. Sorry it is kind of a cry for help.When I was a kid I was reading books like a madman. I distinctly remember the time the 6th volume of Harry Potter came out and I stayed up all night managing to read the entire thing in one sitting. I am 24 years old now and would absolutely not be able to accomplish such a feat. Years of sitting in front of screens and allowing that dopamine flow have wrecked my attention span. I get easily distracted by the smallest things while reading a book constantly having to reread paragraphs ultimately getting frustrated and putting the book away for later and a book that should not take longer than a week takes me at least a few MONTHS to read.I struggle with studying too. The entirety of school was easy for me and I did not have to study that much so naturally I filled that time with video games and the internet instead. Since I was a shy introverted guy filled with social anxiety who did not really have friends I had tons of time to waste in front of the computer or the phone. By the time university came I was in no way prepared and disciplined enough for it I did not have a work or study ethic. I ended up wasting my time dropping out of 3 different majors Chinese studies law and computer science because they ended up not feeling right for me and me lacking the attention span and perseverance to try my best. I still do not have a degree despite being 24. I am starting Sound Design this October since I have determined that I am interested in music and sound and would like to pursue that as a career but I fear my lack of focus will because me to fail that as well.Nowadays I am working in an office where I naturally have to be in front of a computer for 8 hours then I go back to a lonely home where I am going to sit in front of another computer or my phone until it is time to sleep day after day after day. it is a job which barely pays enough for me to sustain myself saving up for traveling which is what I dream of doing is off the table. I am lonely. I do not have a girlfriend I do not exercise I am overweight not obese though I barely spend time on any other hobbies. I could be amazing at playing piano and learning Japanese which are two things that I am interested in if only I was willing to spend as much time on them as I am spending on video games and watching stupid bullshit on the internet. But my stupid brain refuses to actually focus and I cannot get my shit together. I have tried making a change reducing my screen time a few times but it always falls apart after a few days tops.I need help. I do not want to be a depressed lonely underachiever filled with regret for the rest of my days. I am a depressed lonely underachieving internetvideo game addict with no perspectives. Rantcry for help,Depression
40472,40469,i have no friend that i enjoy spending time with i m about to go through my second messy breakup in the past two year the last of which got me diagnosed with ptsd my family ha done nothing but ignore me emotionally for my entire life and i fucking want out i m live with my parent because i m a minor and have lived in the country very far away from people for year now i don t really have any dream or ambition and i have had depression and anxiety for a long a i can remember i m tired of everything and i just want it to stop i m behind in schoolwork and i m just recovering from an antidepressant that worsened my feeling my school is online and i don t really have any option to interact with people other than my parent now that my partner is breaking up with me nothing really brings me happiness and i just feel like there s nothing i m going to do in life i don t want to go to college or really be successful all i really want to do is to find love but i m not even sure if that s a good ambition anymore especially since no one would actually stay with me i don t know what to do anymore,Depression
38545,38542,i have a hard time articulating how i really feel and it frustrates me to no end i just wan na let it all out but it so hard it make it a lot difficult to seek help when i can t really explain what i m feeling and thinking about i can somewhat recognize what i m feeling but the moment i try to write it down or explain it my mind go blank though i can say a part of me doe feel guilty for unloading all my problem onto someone so maybe thats one of the reason i m unable to reach out to people for help plus another part of me is like trying to convince myself i m actually ok and faking it or being overdramatic which also stop me from saying anything so i usually turn to the internet to see if there s anyone who might feel the same way and could explain it in word better than i can i m sort of relieved to know that there are other people feeling exactly what i m feeling cause it really make me feel like i m not alone in this although it really suck that we all have to go through this i m not in a good state right now so i can t really give word of encouragement without feeling like a hypocrite but yeah you re definitely not alone in this,Depression
11015,11035,I have treatment resistant depression. I am happy with my psychiatrist but I am moving on from my talk therapist of 20 years. he is the only therapist I have seen and I felt that sessions with him had stagnated. I have an appointment with a new therapist on Monday and I am dreading it because feel like I am standing at the bottom of a huge mountain. I feel the need to explain to him how I arrived at this point in my life but I have no idea where to begin or how get him up to speed.Any guidance would be appreciated. Need advice on moving to a new therapist.,Depression

47845,47828,I feel like I dont matter anymore These last few years my depression has only gotten worse no matter what I try. My fiance snaps at me when I try to make sure she isnt going to hurt herself my PTSD flares up every time something goes wrong. I dont feel like I can work anymore but I have to because I have to look after my fiance whos got BPD and bring in the money to afford food and rent. I dont feel like I can look after myself. Insomnia has been a bitch for me for years its only gotten worse in the last year. I like to maintain Im doing well but honestly I almost took some pills last night and locked myself in the bathroom. I dont want to be here anymore. But I dont feel like I can talk about it because my partner always has something for their own on when Im feeling low. I just bottle I guess. I want to talk I see a therapist but all the progress I make feels like it get reversed constantly. I havent felt this low in years and its hard to maintain a itll get better outlook like this. When? When will this get better?Ive been bullied at work punished for my disability at work Ive suffered through a narcissistic abusive mother and a father who just stood idly by. Ive had an ex SA me and cheat on me. Ive had friends lie and manipulate me taking advantage of me. I dont have a single family member I can trust anymore.The only thing keeping me going is my dog hes only 11 months. I love him so much. I never want to lose him. The desire to leave and go to work and never come back is so strong. Its so so overpowering that I feel like shaking. I dont want to feel like this. I dont want my PTSD to flare up every time something goes wrong I dont want my depression to spiral in turn I just want to be healthy again. I miss the competent me. My fiance has a lot going on I always understand that. I just sometimes dont feel like the same empathy I give her for her conditions gets extended to meI feel like Im just here for her. Outside of that I just kinda float in existence. I always used to joke that my name means happy or lucky but I havent felt it once. Im very unlucky. Happiness is so difficult for me to get. Im tired. I will try to stay around. I always have done. Ive survived all my worst days so far right? That what I say. I just wanted to vent and someone understand me for once.,Depression

25140,25160,hello everyone!I have been pretty upset recently about myself as an individual and read a few self helpself love blogs which constantly reassure me that its okay some people are more successful than me and we should love and value ourselves just the way we are. but what if i wanted to be greedier? what if i wanted to be selfish? i write fanfiction online for years now and seeing other people more successful than me hurts. an online friend recently started writing as well and they are more successful than i am. i understand that i am being petty and jealous but that is how i truly feel. in a lot of aspects in my life if were being honest work when i was in school hobbies etc. is it so wrong of me that i want success and have conditioned myself into believing being good or successful in whatever it is i do equates to the value of my worth? is it so wrong that i crave success instantly rather than waiting for the future to bring me a dash of success later as so many blogs have said? I am not talking about fame or fortune but a pat in the head would be nice from time to time. accepting the fact that people are more successful and talented than you is painful,Depression
9444,9464,And I never know when a bad day is coming! I could be having a great week and suddenly it all just hits me. I then have no motivation to do anything constantly tired see no meaning in living just want to stare at a wall while on the verge of tears. Here is where I am at the moment. I have not seeked help since its not always like this. Some days I am feeling great but there is no balance in my life. And I do not know what to do about it. I have tried journaling exercise meditation and that kind of stuff but it is not helping! Some days are great others suck,Depression
15380,15400,I am spiraling tonight into self hate. I could be out with friends or doing something else. My fiance has a drinking problem and always goes to his buddy Mikes to watch football and to drink. I stopped wanting them to do it at our house because I do not drink anymore and I want the house clean on Monday morning and his friends always overstay their welcome and spill beer everywhere and are disrespectful. Have you ever seen the movie Mother! with Jennifer Lawrence? That is how I feel when they come over all weekend. I am 3 weeks into quitting cannabis which is highlighting my lonliness. I think weed gave me social anxiety and I was content to be alone and work on art or other introverted activities. Now I feel so depressed and alone. I have cancelled with friends and I may have alienated most of them because of my flakiness. My fiance is good to me in so many ways and I think its important he hangs out with his friends without me. I could go hang out with him but I hate how drunk and stupid they are and they smell like my alcoholic dad which makes me feel nauseous. they are having a bro night and say sexist shit. I am kind of a bitch to my fiance when he is around and starts getting too drunk and annoying like I will correct him if he repeats himself too many times or says some obvious or grandiose shit so he leaves. I know I am making progress and soon I will have other things to distract myself but right now I feel alone and empty. My dog is not happy with me its too dark to safely take her outside in this neighborhood and she thinks I am being lazy. I also keep getting minor colds or sinus infections so my energy is down. I feel like I keep getting sick or injured. Right now I do not know what to do. Its late Sunday night and I am cleaning an empty house and making soup all alone. I feel like a lonely housewife but without kids. Another weekend alone,Depression

40228,40225,i am not sure if this is the right place for it but last friday one of my classmate told me jokingly to jump out of a window i ve had it up to here so i said i d blow my head off my other teacher know i don t mean it most of the time but we had a new teacher during that lesson and i guess he took it seriously will come back to that later on the weekend i tried to hurt myself and went to the hospital on monday they prescribed me some lexapro and i went home relieved that i finally got some help half an hour after i returned home cop stormed my apartment saying they received a hint from the school that i wa gon na hurt myself and they searched my whole apartment for a gun which i don t have so they obv didn t find one they then took me to the same hospital i wa at just half an hour ago and i spoke to the psychiatrist there again who told the police i am not a threat to myself or someone else so they let me go again during that they took my phone and it ran out of battery and i didn t have access to it for like hour or more during that time two of my classmate messaged me asking why i blocked them and they attacked me not knowing my phone ran out of battery and that s why i didn t answer they then blocked me and i explained to them on instagram what happened and they read it but didn t care apparently the police said they would send a car to the school to talk to the headmaster but idk what came out of it i am guessing my new teacher reported it i am so scared of getting kicked out of school god damn i have an exam today and now i am unsure if i am allowed to go to school again today i am currently on my way to find out and i am on the verge of a panic attack because even if i am allowed my classmate will hate me and attack me and it will be super awkward idk what i tried to do with this post but i just needed to tell someone i am so anxious and hate myself for not shutting up for once thanks for reading,Depression
47120,47108,My doctor just prescribed me antidepressants and i dont know what to do So im in therapy right now and i really enjoy it. I need my doctor to fill out a document so my insurance will pay for my therapy. I alreasy got diagnosed with depression so thats what i told my doctor. He just asked about how much time i woulf spend on my smartphone ? and that thats the reason why im depressed.And tbh i didnt corrected him because i didnt felt comfortable from the start to talk to this man who i see about 1 time a year about my mental health.After that he just prescribed me without anything anti depressants?! Says i schould just take them and im totally overwhelmed with the situation. Schould i?,Depression
21522,21542,My family members were usually the ones who would make me feel bad about my lack of interest in personal hygiene and cleaning. My elder sister used to laugh because I did not shower too often as a kid and told me that I smell like a pig or a girl should always be clean. Why do not you wax more often? Why do not you brush your teeth? Why do you go outside with oily hair? Why is your laptop screen so dusty? I have reached a point where I do not even perceive the mess I am leaving behind anymore. A flatmate was disgusted that I do not wash the bathtub often enough and I left the toilet dirty a few times. I did not notice. I am afraid to invite anyone into my apartment because I have a feeling people will be disgusted by the mess dust things left lying around dirty bathroom and so on. I hide my feet because of my calluses and nonexistent pedicure. I try not to smile because I am selfconscious about it. And the list could go on. I am very ashamed and embarrassed especially after being laughed at since I was a kid. I am not bothered by my bad habits so I have no idea how much serious my problem is. Pretending to care about hygiene only because people would laugh at me otherwise,Depression
26307,26327,I can tell I am getting bad again. I hate when I get like this. I wish I could be who I was before all of this. I used to be so bright. I am slowly destroying myself and all of my relationships and all I can do is watch as I burn them all to the ground. Getting bad again.,Depression

7152,7172,I started having depression since i was 17 or smth i am 24 now. From that age it just feels like this feeling of being so damn depressed comes and goes. Its very hard to wake up each day and to live through that i hate it so much i feel like I do not want to go on anymore. I also have bad anxiety throughout the day i feel like I cannot breathe and my heart beats so fast and i feel dizzy. So its like every day is harder to go by. I think I am going to go to a therapist but for now i really need some type of relief even if its for a few hours i have this medication in my home called tramadol I have been googling about it but I am not sure is it a type of medication that helps with these anxiety and depression if i take at least a small dose of it? If anyone has any info about it please tell me I have been feeling very depressed for almost 3 weeks now,Depression

20119,20139,I was diagnosed with it early in life but I have always dealt with it. Just as I have gotten a bit older it seems to have become a more constant more permanent fixture to my existence.In the past you could maybe attribute it to this or that like bad luck or even substance abuse. Or even the loss of friends andor family or other traumatic events but I am yearspast such events and I have better habits now. Plus out of sheer necessity I kind of remobilized myself and even got an excellent job again at the start of the year. Something I am good at that I can do well. So I cannot really work on those aspects anymore. I am legit in all that again. it is like I made it somewhere but it changed nothing internally.But things I do none of it changes my utter lack of feeling. My total disinterest in life. No matter the changes I make things that would be considered and are positive do nothing to elevate my mood and general outlook on life. Whether I am in elite physical condition again or not or earning good money or not none of it really helps. It feels really nice to be able to buy something for someone I care about but every time I get paid it almost all just goes to my savings. Like I just have no real motivation or ambition. it is like a burnout or something like just being so worn out from carrying great responsibility at times for so long.I honestly cannot think of much to buy that I really want. One of the last holdouts was videogames. I have always enjoyed them but lately I do not really even feel motivated to do gaming of my own. Then the other day a really sweet coworker of mine gave me a really nice compliment but I just kind of smiled and felt kind of sad about it for some reason. Like I felt like it was wasted on me and that she would be better off devoting that energy to someone else.And yeah I do have unhealthy selfdestructive thoughts that at times seem comforting. I try not to indulge them. it is all fairly dysfunctional at times. I disappoint myself here.It sucks too because I cannot give up. There is not one person on this Earth to whom I can run for support. everyone is gone moved on or I just blew it with them and they do not want anything to do with me. So if I do not earn a check I have nothing. I must continue and it is all just bleak at times since I would really wish just to go somewhere far away somewhere dark and isolated. Like a sanctuary for despair which I hate to say.it is just a reality of my life and it kind of sucks that I have not been able to move past it much despite accomplishing some great things recently. Rather it seems more a part of me more certainly than before. Anyway sorry for the wall of text. Just I would been carrying these thoughts for sometime now. Seems Like I will Never Be Rid of Depression,Depression

18454,18474,I was once a flower. My petals were small and wilted around the edges for as I was growing I did not receive enough sunlight. That did not matter to you. You were a caterpillar. A hungry caterpillar. You ate my petals. You savored their flavor. Day after day you would take the tiniest nibble from me. It took years before you had eaten me away until I was nothing. By then everyone had forgotten I was once a flower. I remember.How do you interpret this? How do you interpret this?,Depression

Covid almost gone in country. Everything started to get better. But in Februarycoup happened. The country is getting a little bit up from recession and coup dragged us down back. Everyone is dying everyday. Everyday is just pure depression. And about a week ago covid third wave happened which is alot stronger than previous waves. People dying from running out of oxygen. Sowe have to buy oxygen tanks. And thenmilitary took over almost every oxygen tank and mask manufacturers and stop manufacturing. There is no hope. I do not even how I will die. From military or covid? I hope some powerful country just nuke us and die within a second without feeling anything. I wish I could just die painlessly and peacefully.,Depression

20205,20225,I just realized I did not thought of it today at all. I always were a lonely person because of my father's job. I never tried so hard to keep friends because I would always lose touch and that hurts. I cannot believe in any religious bullshit so besides my family I always felt empty. The lack of challenges in my childhood did not help either. I always were the gifted child that can do it all. I realized that I was bored of doing anything in my life for the first time when I realized I could choose any path and I would have success without trying harder. So I decided to do something that would requiring a physical test because I were fat at the time. I got ripped and nailed the test. So I decided to abandon that path and I went to a engineering course because it was a child dream. In college I met the best think that ever happened to me. My ex girlfriend. Nothing in my life had given such joy. I tried to avoid her for almost a year because I knew my broken mind would lead to one us with a broken heart. I could not resist. We dated from to 2016 until March this year. I wish he had started it later with me with a better mind. The truth is that I failed with her I have never shown the affection that she needed. She needs someone that is able to take care of her. I will always blame myself for not standing up for her in a stupid fight with some former friends. I tried to keep the status quo because I thought it would bring her peace. If I had taken a sec to think about it I would have realized that it that the status quo were gone. I failed when she needed me the most like always. Eventually her love for me fadded away. I tried o be by her side when all our friends turned away. That was not enough in a dream vacation with her in February last year I discovered that she was cheating on me. My life shattered. I had been with other girls before her but like everything in my life nothing that were so special. So since that day I have been surfing in the idea of killing myself. Sometimes it went higher and I almost did it. For months I could not even confront her because that was so off character that I tried to convince myself that could not be real. Eventually I talked to her. We tried for some months but I think she did not love me anymore and I was to broken to do anything healthy. I had way to many panic attacks since then. Eventually I read in a secret diary of hers that she started cheating on me again. I did nothing. At this point I only blame myself. The guilty is a burden that never leaves. And then I read that she was trying to break up but could not do it. So I did it for her. I almost killed myself multiple times after that. I reached old friends because I was completely lost. It went out as good idea. 2 of them have been really good friends and very supportive. One bringing me out of my house and making me do something fun to distract me. The other one had 2 friends that committed suicide before so she ended up been very thoughtful and comprehensive. Then my ex reached me with her problems out of nowhere. At first I was happy because I always enjoyed been useful to her. The problem is that I care too much about her problems and seen her like that made me go in a crazy spiral. I exploded when she lied to me. She is a terrible at this. Lies were always a trigger to me. I do not even know why she would need to lie. You do not to need to pretend that you already had maked out with some random stranger we are not strangers anymore. And the she snap out at me because I had contact with here nemesis from the fight I mentioned before. I did not need you to do that I was already guilty. The truth is I would have been with Hitler Stalin and Satan in that state of mind just to feel company. Then I decided to visit my parentes and one of the friends that I mentioned before they live in the same city. Seen my parents together restored my faith that something like that is possible. I do not know how because I feel sometimes that I am too broke for a relationship. Seen that friend made me feel comfortable like someone outside my family cares about me. That made my bad feelings about my ex dissipate. And I decided to talk to her. I offered something that she always wanted. I do care about her. But I need to know that she is 100 on board. Given her that would bring me peace and all the guilty that I have will go.This history did not end yet. Of course I am doing therapy. I am still trying to find a purpose in the emptiness of the universe. But today I do not feel like I have to commit suicide. At least for today I was able to let some of the ghosts that haunts me go. Sorry for the grammar or anything. English is not my first language and I am writing this out of a lot of emotion. First day I did not have suicidal thoughts since February of last year,Depression
24614,24634,For maybe 8 years or so I have developed a pretty strong self hatred and doubt. I used to be extremely confident in HS but later in it I lost that confidence.Now as a 24yo software developer with a full time work from home job my first even! I have days quite often where I just feel awful. I will feel like a failure for not being happy or for not being able to get up and work sometimes.For 8 years I have denied this is anything different from what others go through and decided I am simply being weaker than most by not being able to dealwith these feelings.What I want to know is... Is this actually as normalas I think it is? To one day be tearfully happy with your life nice apt with gf of 5 years work from home 48k year 2 good cats but the next day be so damn sad for no reason that it is difficult to get up to work? Is this normal?,Depression
24139,24159,So I even feel bad about myself for having to write this ir order to feel as if I have someone to speak about this stuff it seems as if people that say to be your friends use your weaknesses whenever they have a chance to hurt you if you let them know about them I have chronic low back pain for 10 years now done physical therapy and all have tried different diets supplements etc nothing has worked on top of that I am in law school and now I do not have the will power or i think even the capacity to learn all of that like normal people do its as if the depression I have felt through my whole life has shattered my brain my hippocampus must be so small by now I understand subjects relatively quick but I forget so much so fast at least if I got my degree my parents would stop watching me suffer like a fucking looser I tend to perceive how sorry they must feel for me at least I am not a drug addic. I try to get better but with no success I study I lift weights and nothing changes maybe I should study more but there comes my crippling add with rumination to fuck up my studying ambitions at least I have a girlfriend that really cares for me but how long will she withstand to be with a fuck up with add chronic pain chronic depression? I feel like if I knew no one would suffer I would just kill myself but I could not do that to the people that care about me so I am stuck here And I know that there are people out there that have it so much more difficult but for me this feels like impossible to get better I feel like a burden useless helpless On not being able to get better,Depression
11509,11529,I can ignore how unsatisfied I am most of the time. Can go for walks try to practice mindfulness be present in my surroundings find some transient comfort in the moment. Be grateful for what I have.But all that does is just shovel my feelings of unsatisfaction and self loathing aside. Shove it into a box. Or maybe ite more like building a damn and occasionally the damn breaks or the reservoir is overfull and everything just floods in. Without flung e into specificd this is not where I wanted to be at this point in my life. Worse I cannot actually imagine my life being any different anymore.I mean it would be foolish and unrealistic for somebody approaching 40 too imagine they could become a professional athlete. I have no desire to do that but that is how everything feels to me me. Every path feels totally unfeasible. I have no particular goals or interests. So all I can do is plod along the best I can hope for is a job I do not actively hate.Honestly if somebody said I could press a button to wipe my life from existence without causing others pain it would be hard to not press it. I can easily just shove my negative thoughts aside but all it means is that' there is a void of feeling. Then occasionally the barrier breaks and I feel very sad.,Depression

23877,23897,I am a 31 year old man and I hate myself. I hate the way my face looks I struggle to lose weight and I do not even like the sound of my own voice. I get such extreme anxiety when talking to people especially for work. Started a new job that I thought I would love and that id be set for life for and I just feel like an imposter trying to fit in. My manager let me know that I am not doing good and that I am struggling to learn or communicate with others. I have never felt like I fit in anywhere either. I have tried and failed to make friends SO many times in my life that I have completely given up. I never even attempted to get into a relationship because I know when I get rejected I am going to take it so personally that I am going to be a complete wreck. Its why I am still a virgin who has never even been kissed or been touched or been on a date before and I have a porn addiction now too. I spend hours looking at porn and edging. Now I am so afraid that I might be turning gay or bisexual because the only porn and fantasies that turn me on anymore involve sex with other men. I constantly go on grindr or omegle and sext with other men all the time because they are the only ones who i get a response from. If my parents ever found that out about me they would be so disappointed and would disown me. I do not want to off myself but I do wish sometimes i would just pass in my sleep. I feel like a failure both as a man and as a human being. I hate myself,Depression

11094,11114,18F Alright this shit is not funny anymore . I am getting tired amp IRRITATED. I just want to be happy dude. that is the only thing I have ever wanted. Idc what it takes at this point. Its not fucking fair. I wish I was normal. I wish i was not so weird or awkward. I wish I could make friends amp maintain relationships. I wish I had friends to go out with. I wish I had a support system. I wish my parents loved me and did not look at me like a disappointment. I wish I did not drop out of college. I wish I did not push everyone away because of how much I hate myself. I feel disgusting. I do not even know who I am! I do not have any fucking interests nothing excites me. I have tried positive affirmations and CBT methods on my own and nothing works. All of the negative things I have heard from my childhood stick to me. I 100 believe I am worthless and unlovable. I hate feeling this way. I want to wake up one morning and not feel dread. I want to wake up hopeful optimistic and experience the feeling of truly loving my life.I do not think I ever will. And none of you give me hope because everyone in this sub says it does not get better ..well god I am ready whenever you are. I hope you got a good laugh from playing tf outta my life. Typed this while crying in my car on my lunch break because I feel like a loserrrr amp I got a speeding ticket because I speed when I am mad so that is greatMy coworker told me they rarely get sad never been depressed amp never wanted to kill themselves ever.

7984,8004,I wanted to be intimate with my partner but I could not. He was over me making out with me but I began to cry and as his hands wandered it felt worse. It felt as I was looking at my motionless body laying there powerless and it felt as I was suffocating. I eventually was able to tell him to stop and left but I love him and we have done this before but lately anytime intimacy is close to happening I experience the same thing he does not know about my depression. No one does. I cannot be intimate,Depression

26680,26700,I see al these kids my age on social media and whenever I go out hanging out with their friends and it always makes me sad. I wish I had friends to hang out with. I am getting a 2nd job just so I do not have these thoughts that would make me depressed. I thought getting a job would make me less depressed but I realized the reason why I am depressed is because I have no social life with other people. Only people I socialize with is my familyco workers and customers. All those people obviously you have to communicate with. Friends are people that actually like you for who you are. I definitely would rather have friends and be broke than be what I am now. I am only making minimum wage at a dead end job. I just hope one day I will have friends so I can feel myself again and be happy. It always frustrates me that I feel happy until I get home and have nothing to do. Whenever I am at work I am pretty social but when I get home I do not want to talk or do anything. I just want to cry but I have thought of these things sm and have cried about sm that I cannot even cry. I just want to let it all out so I can mentally and physically feel satisfied. Sigh I wish I had friends I wish I could redo my mistakes and just start my life all over with the knowledge that I have now. Sigh,Depression
9162,9182,I just really want to get this out and maybe please hopefully someone has some words that might be able to help at all. I am really really sorry about it being so long I just need to get it outIm a 26 year old Indian man grown up in quite a traditional household in the UK which means mental health is always a taboo subject and as such I have never brought up any issues I have had with my parents. I think on some level they might know I have experienced issues in some capacity given I have done a lot of reading on the subject and done charity work for mental health charities etc. but a part of me wonders if their upbringing makes it obvious to believe that its a true problem that is not sorted with a hugSo I went to a good school excellent university had great grades show great social skills as a front whenever I need to had a good job then took a two years out and moved to Japan and now moved back a month ago living with my parents for the first time in 8 years.Something is wrong I just feel so mentally fragile all the time. Nothing I do gets me any mental strength and I run on a rolling 12 day cycle of feeling ok then heavy and useless again. As a backstory I grew up with no friends a situation I actually do not remember as I have recently realised I have SDAM Inability to remember anything than the most recent few years. Which I always saw as a positive because whatever it was it was in the past and I am beyond that. From 1820 in university I always felt completely mentally strong and myself. Then at the same time found out about some infidelity in my father the only person I had felt close to until that time excluding my brother and the only person Id ever call if anything went wrong. Fortunately those trust issues were compensated for by finding my first love at the time but then when I moved to America this was compensated for by drinking excessively for that entire year pretty much joining a frat and drinking all my troubles away for the year without talking to my family at all. That year concluded in breaking up with my girlfriend at the time due to further lies and infidelity from her side. Then back in the UK to finish my studies and started work for a few years. After the initial getting over the trust from my ex these 34 years were probably the strongest of my life. I felt confident over all the trust issues or so I thought regained my relationship with family and friends. I had a great job a great house good circle of friends. Just a great all round time.Then I went to Japan and again the first 6 months of my life were some of the most exciting new city new culture incredible new career learning so much about myself. And found love for the 2nd time which happened to be during covid quarantine and as such went from 0100 which was the most incredible and comfortable 3 months of my life. As someone who people say connect with them in a way they have never experienced all the time finding truly someone who I feel that relationship reciprocated is very rare for me so was very excited. Then slowly over the next year and a half that turned into a steady comfortable relationship. Were very different people but somehow it worked I think she slowed me down in a much needed way. Although my good times previously were very mentally strong it was very highfunctioning and I probably needed someone who just lived in the now bringing me back to a healthier version of strong mindHowever again through a few of halftruths and lies about the past from her side over the next 3 months sort of put a damper on it and made me continually question the relationship. The thing is this time round although not condoning it I can actually see the logic as to why there was lies and in my clearest mind can see that we still have a confident future together as there was no malicious intent. Long story short the year since then has been a constant rumination of mental battles on the SAME issues over and over again mainly trust and whenever I get stuck thinking about it it takes me weeks or even months to get over it and regresses me back into my worst depressive states. And although I do not know the true because the more I think about it rather than from the actual issues from the relationship I think the underlying issues with my previous trust being broken in my father and first love have put me in a position where although I want to I cannot just let go of the past with the new relationship and I struggle trust again and this just screws up my whole mind.These ruminations were kept at bay while in Japan because I was still surrounded with the loving relationship and doing meditation yoga and surfing to keep my mind as clear as possible. Although often getting stuck I found myself getting out of it much quicker. The only way it really did however was to almost limit the longevity of the relationship in my mind to limit how much the hurt caused me to become unfunctional as a human Now back in the UK for a month and I am STUCK beyond belief. I feel like the same thought loops get stuck in my head and I find myself going over the same thing and the same conversations with my brain trying to apply some logic as to why I should get over it. All this does is mentally weigh me down beyond belief and just continually ruin my daytoday life. And now I cannot bring myself to do any of the things which helped yoga meditation. Everything just gets me stuck in a way I cannot live. I do not know if its the being back at my parents home after so long the relationship lack of trust the lack of job the culture shock or just all of them. I think with my idle mind is the devils plaything and most of all it seems to be playing on my relationship view and ruining my mind.Now my every interaction just leads me into a state of mental instability. Today my parents came back after a day out and told me they bought me some new bedsheets as a gift but the prospect of anything new surprise out of the ordinary just breaks me and I had to walk away saying I did not want it half angry while trying to hold back tears. Just crumbing mentallyThen all I can do is get angry at myself for acting like a dick in the face of a kind gesture from people who love me.I just do not know what to do nothing I do feels like it helps and I do not want to do anything other than stay in bed all day while I am torn about putting on a brave face to my parents so they do not see it in me. I want to get back to the healthy self I was at any point in my life but do not know how to do it.If anyone can read this and maybe provide any help something to do something to focus on anyone who is been through something similar or even someone to talk to I would be really appreciative.I am really sorry again for the long post. do not know how to continue in life,Depression
7738,7758,I could finally die without having to leave my family with the fact that I killed myself. Even if it was three five years in the future Id be so grateful knowing I had a guaranteed expiration date and did not have to stay here indefinitely. I know I have said this before but getting a terminal illness would be the best thing that could happen to me,Depression
16152,16172,Wish I could just die in my sleep sometimes. Sometimes I hate going to sleep because my dreams are better than reality And then I have to wake up to a mundane life.,Depression
37970,37967,every time i start to be stupid enough to believe that maybe i m not crap or that thing might be ok something bad always happens when i stay depressed and assume the worst and feel bad about myself thing usually remain about the same what is the use of trying,Depression
27218,27238,Just ah idk thought I would let you all know I am being admitted to a young adult mental health ward I am 24. I will be going into hospital tomorrow I am kind of somewhat excited about it. To meet similar people going through similar shit and just to be able function like a normal person in the real world. I am also pretty nervous not going to lie. Has anyone else been admitted to anything like this? What should I expect? My anxiety has reached a critical breaking point depression is pretty shit PTSD ughh bad and self harm coming back frequently soooo with a lot of researching and speaking with my PsychiatristGP they recommended I be admitted for a bit. Take a break get better. So fingers crossed this works. Thanks for reading. Admitted to hospital,Depression
47805,47788,I am depressed I recently talked to a psychologist i noticed that i needed help but it didnt helped a lot.I cant eat even if sometimes i am hungry i dont have any problems with my weight i vomit like every day for no reason.I have to wait like 3 hours to sleep just because my brain doesnt stop talking for a second.Nothing seems to go right these days i tried everything but i cant help myself even if i try.It feels like my stomach is trying to expel my feelings outside.I also broke up with my girlfriend cause we were both depressed af and we couldnt help each others.I feel like i cant go any deepeer can someone helps me to find out how can i survive to my self. sorry for my bad english,Depression
8509,8529,I really hate this world. Look at the news you will ONLY see suffering and pain. The only time I will get some drops of happiness is when I take drugs and I know very well that is not the way. 90 of people are pieces of shits. Sometimes I just hope that I when I sleep that I will not wake up. I always thought I am not depressed because I am not sad but I am actually not feeling anything at all I am dull. The years of of heavy drug abuse left me scarred and its hard to accept but its the truth. The society that we all live in is pure bullshit and I hate almost everyone I know to some degree. I am always wearing a mask when I am with my friends and they would never know I am feeling like this. Fuck the world and everyone. Just some venting,Depression
10798,10818,I just hate this feeling of emptiness I have 247. I cannot even say its sadness its just a feeling of pure emptiness I hate this felling of emptiness,Depression
47661,47645,I dont recognize myself I just need to rant real quick. Everything sucks. Ive been stuck in dpdr for about 2 years now. Its been bad but its gotten worse. My home life hasnt been great for a while now. My parents have been fighting a lot and recently told me they were going to divorce soon. My sister constantly degrades everyone in the house and will sit around all day and refuse to go to school. My mom is having work trouble. And my dad has kinda been the punching bag of it all. Fighting and yelling has become a regular occurrence. I cant stand it. Ive been trying to keep myself together and come off as calm so maybe some stress could be taken off of everyone but Im actually falling apart inside. My theory is if they see that Im calm they will have one less thing to worry about. Im always anticipating the next fight between any of the three and it sucks. I actually feel a sense of relief at school because atleast Im away from all this. But schools not any better. Ive gotten to the point where I dont recognize myself in the mirror. I dont see me I see a shell. I want to get out and run away from everything. Im only 15 so thats not an option though. Nothing feels real and I just dont want to be here anymore. I just feel stuck and I have no one to talk to. Every time I would try to talk to my mom about my dpdr she would say Ive been looking at the internet too much. I dont want to talk to her about it because im scared shell say that again or explode from all the stress. She also dumps all her work problems on me and that just adds to the stress. Im just scared. I dont want them to divorce. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I dont know how much longer I can hold it in. I was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago and have meds but Im so tired and drained that I cant remember to take them. I just dont know what to do anymore.,Depression
19956,19976,cannot find a job. cannot find an emotional connection with someone. cannot lose weight. cannot sleep. cannot love myself. cannot stop being lonely. cannot get out of bed. cannot make good life decisions. cannot get people to like me.

14815,14835,In my country we are still under lockdown. We are stuck at home and maybe some people still go out to get groceries or to pack food but nothing much happens anymore. I am on a break before uni now and every day i am basically free. I should be so happy that i have a few months of completely no responsibility or so it seems. However i feel so utterly horrible sometimes and today is one of those times. I am crying as I am typing this and i just feel so bad about myself. I have not even picked a course for uni and I just have no idea what to pick I cannot pinpoint my interests and I have no true passion and at this point I am just such a hassle and an annoyance to my family because I cannot get myself together. Maybe I should just pick a course and go with it regardless of my interests? At least that way I make a choice. I hate myself too and ever so often I get reminded about it when I look in the mirror closely. I feel useless and I have no talents and I am not good at anything and I feel like nobody really truly needs me here. I sound like I want to be the centre of the universe but no I just cannot help feeling this way like nobody wants me. I wrote down in a book a list of things to do but i can barely get myself to cross one thing off that list. Its just so hard to do anything other than binge watch shows and play games. I know many are not coping well in the pandemic but I do not think my friends have gotten to a point as low as I have. In the day when my familys awake I look fine and dandy but when the clock strikes midnight and everyone goes to bed I am alone with my feelings and thoughts and that is when the demons come out. Feeling so very bad about my life again,Depression
13150,13170,I was asked by a friend why have you been so rude lately a few months ago. October 23 2020. ampx200BAt 12 midnight I responded with There really is not a straight answer to that question If I told you you would probably say I am faking it. I have this thing that feels like a disease and it turns my positive switches off. It was not always like this though. I was nice sometimes being too nice to the point I agree with everyone else's opinions no matter what it was. I thought when people were mean it meant they chose to be. But now that you ask I realize it might not be the only reason. I had little to no patience for anything. I lived in a constant state of anxiety and worry. When I engaged in conversation I felt like people found me annoying and boring. I insulted them and a majority of the time gave them a passiveaggressive excuse for distancing myself from them. Thing is I did not plan on being rude it just happened. In the moment. ampx200BJesus Christ did not realize it was that long. Now that I am taking a good look at it I was right back then. I relate to that so much. Of course I said it myself. I just thought I must have learned that from watching something and applied it to myself because I related. But I tried to copy and paste it but those are my words.I do not remember ever feeling so strongly. Maybe I blocked it out of my mind to distract myself. If so good job me. It worked. But I found those messages again and it has me thinking. How do you stop being mean to people?Just now not even like 30 mins ago I asked reddit what is the best excuse to get out of working with someone . I am alone. But I am doing this to myselfIts been however long and I am doing the same damn thinampx200Bampx200BIts a goddamn loop and its fucking annoying as I type this I am slamming on the keys because it pisses me off so damn much. I wish I could kill it or something How do you stop being mean to people?,Depression
15312,15332,Recently have been incarcerated due to domestic violence alligations that are against me. I am no monster I know I am innocent all that happened was that I was caught arguing with girlfriend at the wrong place at the wrong time. I have a son with her and will not be able to see them until next year due to a no contact order I have against her. But to be honest I think me and her will never ever get the chance to be happy together. At times all we do is argue but the thought of losing her kills me her and my son mean the world to me and i do not want to have my son spending his life one week at his dads and another at his moms. I want to be able to say I am happy with my family but I do not think this will ever be the case which kills me. I am currently going through horrible mental problems and in order to get cope with them I use alcohol. At times I purposely drink and drive just so I have a chance of not making it home that day but I always some how make it home. I am at my ends and do not know what to do I do not have anybody to vent to so I though doing it anonymously would maybe make me feel better so here I am. Thank you for listening. Need help,Depression
18572,18592,I feel so lost. I am in college but I feel like a loser because I am an older student. I feel so behind in life and like I should just give up because I am not good enough. I am stupid and cannot do anything right.I am not the child my parents wanted. My cousins and other relatives are successful and married and attractive and it freaking hurts. The man I wanted told me he did not want a relationship then rubbed his new significant other in my face I feel so broken ugly and unwanted. The person I was supposed to marry awhile back is engaged to the person they cheated on me with. Why does no one want me? Why do not I make anyone happy?I hate my job. I feel like they hate me. I do not belong. anywhere. No one would miss me if I was gone. I cry everyday and I feel like I have no where to turn. I hurt everyday wondering why I have to be the ugly loser no. One ever wanted and why I am so sad all the time. I am sorry for all this but I needed to get it out because I have no one to turn I am so fucking depressed and I do not know what to do,Depression
47318,47304,this isnt the same place even though its literally the same place physically. When I look back 1 year ago for example its not so much that it feels like life has changed but more like its absolutely not the same reality. Im in the exact same house that I was in the exact same rooms and the exact same backyards but its just not the same place. It felt like a different world despite there being very few things different from the environment.It generally isnt very distressing but it gets in the way when I wanna be happy again. I dont know how to completely explain this phenomenon but I do know that its mental.,Depression
40115,40112,in the last month since june 0 i have made bad decision after bad decision to the point where i have completely screwed my life apart i lost my gf because of it i lost my mentor which i loved so much because of it i am in major debt because of it the last month messed my life up and i know it s because of me i end up hurting everyone i love i loved them both so much i have been telling myself the same thing over and over again if i 00 knew that i wa going to heaven if i wa 00 sure that i wa going to god i would have killed my self a long time ago,Depression

26140,26160,Since I was a teenager I have always experienced depressive episodes. I did not know what they were until my late teensearly 20s when I started feeling suicidal and made a few attempts on my life. I have used drugs and alcohol to cope for many yearsnot to the point of being considered an addict but those are only temporary fixes. I have seen professionals and have been medicated but I never feel comfortable enough to discuss my true feelings and lack the ability to verbalize many of my thoughts. I am doing better in life than I was a few years ago but recently I have found myself unable to do many things I have always loved cannot watch movies or listen to music like I used. Ill sit in the dark and look at my phone for hours. It has also affected my professional growth as I am unable to make the time to learn new skills or work a little harder than I usually do. My selfesteem is pretty shot and I have self depreciating thoughts constantly. At this point I am afraid Ill never be happy again. Mental health,Depression
10715,10735,I am 25 years old and I feel like a 60 year old man. The world I was born into no longer exists. All the technology I grew up with is dead and outdated. Major staples of my childhood like renting movies and phone calls are now gone and replaced with something strange. The people I went to high school with may as well be dead and buried considering the last time I have spoken to one of them. But I am still here. I feel like I should be gone too. A relic of a bygone era. I got left behind,Depression
19836,19856,I have been getting more and more depressed over the past few months about this to the point that every conversation with my mother turns into an argument or screaming match because to be quite frank I cannot stand her as a person but she barely works because of medical reasons has no support system other than me and I care about her enough that I cannot leave her on the streets. I pay for all the bills including rent in a shitty duplex we have lived in since I was in high school that has so many problems but considering I am the only one paying bills I cannot afford anything better. It would literally be cheaper and more freeing to be living with an actual roommate that splits the cost of everything instead of my mother who pays for nothing but I cannot.To top it all off she is smothering. She gets offended if I do not want to spend every waking minute not at work talking to her and will cry and throw fits if I just want to be by myself. She treats me like I am 16 rather than 30 and paying all her bills and literally throwing my life away to make sure that she has a place to live.I am just so depressed. I have no time for me. I rarely go out because my friends all think I am weird for living at home and fuck trying to have a romantic relationship. My life is essentially over until she either dies or I win the lottery and I hate thinking that but its the truth. Idk. I am sad and had to get this off my chest. Thanks all. 30 and still stuck living at home with my financially and mentally unstable mother.,Depression
20221,20241,For most people it seems like life is just mostly tiring stressful and what applies to all of us is how pointless it is. Even before I was depressed there really was not all that much worth living for. And I was born into a middle class family with a great upbringing. I could not imagine how terrible it must be for those less fortunate than myself which is the majority of the population.I feel like those who are happier and focus on the positives have to delude themselves into this mindset and pretend that all of the shit going on in their lives does not exist. Its kind of like nostalgia. When you are an adult you reminisce on your childhood and remember how great and awesome school was. But that certainly was not what we were thinking at the time. Most of us hated school because it was boring monotonous and forced us into behaving a certain way.And they say that your school days are the best days of your life... that is just terrifying. I am 19 and have not done anything since I left school. When I was 11 I knew this would happen. I cannot take care of myself or interact with people properly so I knew Id be screwed once I was left to take on the world myself. My nonexistent motivation selfesteem and social skills are making the future look bleak for me. I do not want to become a wage slave in a depraved society that makes you wear a fake smile and pressures you into being like everyone else. And I cannot even be myself if I wanted to because I do not have a personality. Like is this really it? Working and working and more working until I die now? I hate this world I hate humans and how greedy and destructive we are. I do not want to contribute in this. I want to leave. Do the moments of happiness really make life worth living?,Depression

11595,11615,I just feel tired. Unable to do things. I forced myself to go to the gym in hopes I would find that motivation. I walked on a treadmill for 20 minutes before going back to my car. I just feel like I am dragging myself through the motions. I do not even feel like dying or anything right now. I just feel like sleeping. But I do not want time to keep going by. I want to be in the moment and enjoy every second but I cannot enjoy it when I am like this. One of those mini depressive days.,Depression
39909,39906,tw for self harm abuse and suicide for the past year i ve suffered with severe depression from family genetics and other issue a a young kid death wasn t really my first thought it just kind of started appearing after a bit when i wa in middle school my close friend sexually assaulted and abused me for a year and a half they also psychologically manipulated me and abused me in way that i m shocked they got away with i have made around failed suicide attempt in my life time only one ha been severe enough to end up in a hospital because i told people but realistically there s several more that i should have been taken to a hospital for a they probably fucked up some stuff internally i form really strong and probably toxic bond with people to the point where if i think i will be left i try so hard to keep them around that it can be overbearing i ve gone to therapy since i wa in elementary school and i ve done dbt and cbt intensively i have definitely gotten better but the fact that any time someone leaf me i feel so distraught that killing myself feel like the only option my partner and i broke up at the end of january and it ha more or le destroyed me i lost my virginity to them and the breakup came out of the blue they said we could start talking again when they felt like it so i have left them alone i wa being weird about saying hi so i tried to do that some more and i wa feeling better about moving on and staying friend in the future i really haven t been feeling better i still wanted to die but i wa managing it pretty well on monday at midnight they sent a text saying they wanted to give me closure and that they never actually wanted any sort of relationship after and oops sorry about the confusion i m not sure why they sent that we haven t spoken in almost month there ha been no communication and i only told two people how i wa secretly hoping thing could be patched up everyone else who asked i had just said hopefully we can remain friend in the future i know not everyone want to stay friend but they were the one who proposed it that sent me on a spiral i broke month of self harm ripped off my fingernail in stress and haven t eaten correctly since realistically if this is going to be my response to every breakup or conflict how can i keep living like this i don t want to end my own life since a th failed attempt would be embarrassing but i also don t want to be here anymore everyone tell me that in a few month i get to move to my dream town so it ll be fine but really i don t care about that i can t handle the pain now and knowing i ll have to have it possibly many more time is excruciating i feel like i could have been a success story but realistically if it s been so long and i ve only barely gotten better then what s the point i m trying my hardest to find reason to live right now but i don t have much to care about,Depression
22538,22558,So for context when me and my ex started dating I pretty much pushed everyone away because all I wanted to do was focus on him and I. I still had friends but I never really talked to them or hung out with them. Nine months later we broke up and I do not have that many friends anymore. I have been really wanting to make more friends but my only problem is just that I do not have enough motivation to try to find friends. It sucks because I also do not talk to the friends I have because I am scared of them leaving me as well I know that is stupid because we have been friends for so long but yeah. I really do not want to be depressed all summer and have barely anyone to talk to but its looking like that is what is going to happen so yay. Idk what to title this,Depression
47993,47975,I created a list of things wrong with me.. and it's frikkin' long. So I'm having an offday where I just feel empty and not feel like anything. Wanting to at least attempt to get out of it I tried journaling about my selfattacking thoughts and it turned out to be .. a lot of them. I currently suffer a lot from anxiety attacks due to a very low selfesteem amp my financial situation I'm living paycheck to paycheck without savings and honestly I just feel down all the time.I've talked to professionals in the past. However it lead to nothing because of my own stupid stubbornness. I'm too hard to work with amp fix since I just believe I can't change even though that's bullshit. I can't even start or finish anything which makes this so hard to go through to fix myself.

23356,23376,I am currently in a rabbit hole of ADHD youtube videos after talking to my girlfriend and her neighbours about it earlier so naturally got recommended the videos. Everything relates to me on a personal level that I have listened to so far. Trying lots of different meds and them not working or potentially making you feel worse could be symptom of ADHD.Constantly daydreaming and only feeling normal when you can find something to hyper focus on then getting depressed when you get distracted. Procrastinating everything from brushing your teeth or going to the shop. Doing normal things like shopping going for a walk talking and doing it all as fast as possible.And so so so much more. Yes I have depression for countless of reasons from my childhood through school late teens early 20s etc etc but the depression is not the only thing that bothers me. I hate talking to people I struggle to listen I struggle to get my thoughts out I struggle to understand that millions of thoughts going through my head every second I struggle to communicate at any capacity and just many more things.I am going to the doctors as soon as I possibly can and I am going to discuss getting tested for ADHD and other things. I am tired of wallowing in self pity people not taking me seriously tired of not knowing what is wrong with me tired of being mistreated because no one knows what is wrong with me.ADHD is not what most people think it is the highly active disruptive troublesome kid. Yes that kid may have ADHD but there is so many different forms of it. A quote from a doctor is if you have seen 1 kid with ADHD you have only seen 1 kid with ADHD. I am not self diagnosing by any means I am just saying ADHD makes sense to me and I am going to go out and see what I have. I know it is hard to get the motivation to do things but do some self research on different forms of Depression Anxiety ADHD and many other things and find something that relates to you then badger you are doctor or health professional or whatever about what you think and get tested for it. Alot of us have probably been mis diagnosed with a form of depression anxiety or not been diagnosed at all and we feel like lost causes. I just know there is something wrong with me and I am fed up enough to force myself to go out and pester people to test me so they can figure it out. It might not be fixable or manageable but it may help people deal with me better and that is better than feeling alone in a room full of people.Sorry about the wall of text. Just wanted to share my thoughts and probably failing to make sense but I have tried. let us try and help ourselves to at least know what is wrong then work on it from there. We might all feel alone but we are not alone. Some people just hide it better or have found a way to deal with it ADHD,Depression

10218,10238,I have been struggling with depression and social anxiety for the past 10 years. For the past 3 years it has caused me to struggle with anhedonia more regularly and it has been getting worse lately. I am in my midtwenties and I already feel like I have missed out on so many experiences and opportunities in life especially those that are fun. A lot of people have said I am too serious and I need to learn how to loosen up and let go. Unfortunately I cannot seem to do that with alcohol or drugs. I am nervous that I might start increasing start relying on them to feel alive and have let loose. Recently I started going to therapy and I have been wanting to go out and try something fun but due to anhedonia it is difficult for me to find something that is fun for me to do. I was also a little sheltered growing up which does not help either. My parents were helicoptery and devout Christians so a lot of activities that others may consider okayfun is hard for me to enjoy or partake in without an immense amount of guilt and shame. I often find myself searching in Google what do people do for fun? to find out what other people who are not depressed find fun or fulfilling. Many of those activities do not resonate with me. What do you all think? What do people do for fun these days?,Depression
17473,17493,So I am not really suicidal at the moment and I do not class myself as having depression but I am taking antidepressants daily. I constantly get this feeling of just taking load of medication not enough to do anything really bad just enough to feel slightly out of it does anyone else feel this way? I used to do this with anything Id take enough to just feel sleepy enough to make me feel nauseous when eating and my hands tingle. Is there a term for this does anyone else do this? I feel weird talking about it as I have kept it to myself for so long. I do not know if this is the right place to ask but,Depression
47156,47144,I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others especially friends semiregularly my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habitsthings are enjoyable in the moment once I push past my but I don't wanna inner toddler brain I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain okay.And truth be told lately I haven't. Life has been unnecessarily shitty and I've had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that I crumpled. And I know working out would make a much bigger difference to my mood right now than writing this post but I'm sick of everything. Why does life insist on being such a shit show?Update After writing this briefly texting with a redditor who was kind enough to reach out to ask if I'm okay and feeling my feelings for a bit aka crying I put on my workout clothes and got it over with. It didn't do much right then and there but I also went to bed on time to get a proper night's rest and I woke up feeling a little better. So up and onwards I go until the next time I veer off track managing myself. Because there really isn't an alternative. I know how low I get when I throw in the towel and don't pick it back up again quickly enough. ,Depression

19019,19039,My friend F 20 is in a very bad condition right now because of her mother blaming and being very rough on her.Background My friend has an elder sister who is suffering from a mental issue. She is on a lifetime medication which is very expensive. She got married last year after searching for a husband for her for a long time. Her mother wanted to have a househusband for her daughter so that she can take care of her. But my friend denied as it would put more burden on the family which is struggling financially.So her sister got married and went to live with her husband on the condition that her family will pay for her medication as the husband did not do anything. First few months was ok her inlaws took great care of her. But after that things changed. Her condition worsened. She started coming back to her family sometimes staying even for months. Seeing all this her mother started blaming my friend for not allowing her to keep a househusband. Treating her badly. Always shouting amp screaming at her. At this point she shouts on her for anything!My friend is preparing for medical entrance exam she wants to be a vet but all this is hurting her badly. She has become very negative and lost her self confidence I fear she has suicidal thoughts too.I kindly request you all to please advice me how I can help her. She was really good at studies and I want to see her get out of her toxic environment and become a successful vet. We live in India local support is very much appreciated. Need help for my friend,Depression
25372,25392,did everything right did things the way they should be done always chose the selfless choice.

7958,7978,Using my super burner account. I just want to get off my chest how deeply I yearn for the release of this mortal prison. I am too much of a coward to actually kill myself as I do not want to put my parents through such turmoil and guilt but its slowly becoming my plan to end it all once they both pass. Not to relate myself to an NFL athlete but the news stories about players that commit suicide and save their brains to be studied for the longterm effects of concussions is something I think about often. Maybe somehow the mess of my life could mean something and make sense if studied.Food for thought. Hug your familyfriends if you have got them When thinking about killing myself I would not shoot my head in the hopes that someone could study my brain and maybe learn something.,Depression

18337,18357,How can anyone live like this.. thankfully I 23m have a mom dad and a sister but how can I make friendsI'm a socialable talkative guy that has made mistakes in losing my relationships with people. Life is so lonely and I want to start making new friendships No friends..,Depression
13755,13775,pretty much the title. i just cannot bring myself to care about other people anymore no matter how unkind and cold that is. but the thing is I am also very selfaware and i know i do not want to recklessly say anything harsh and insensitive to other people i think them but i just never say them but mostly this is just because i am too tired to deal with the drama that will ensue if i hurt other people with my words. so what i do is just feign responses they expect from me. they only like it when you respond that way but the moment you start even mentioning your depression it feels like they already want to leave the conversation or move on to the next topic. they suddenly do not want to listen to anything you have to say and that really fucking hurts because most of the time that is really all i need not that it will make my depression suddenly go away but i think it helps me get by a little. so yeah I have learned to just keep repressing everything and feigning every response to the people around me. i feel like I have become skilled at feigning a positive mood in front of other people and feigning interest in what they have to say but the truth is i actually could not care less about whatever they say,Depression
20588,20608,We have been in a lockdown for about 2 weeks but I have been in isolation for months since losing my job. The only time I leave the house is for food or cigarettes. Before I was fired I was fired for swapping shifts to prioritise my mental health which just made it even worse lol I was casual btw I was always socialising and hanging out with people after workweekends but as soon as I stopped initiating things I have not had a call or text from anyone. I have become so numb to the world and every day is just the same boring shit. I live in a pretty small community so the only thing people my age do is drink at the shitty local bars. I struggle to find new things to do in this town and just want to fkn escape but I cannot right now because of lockdown. I was kind of glad I could not do anything for my 21st considering my awful mental state and did not really have high hopes for it but I kind of expected maybe a call or text from even just my close circle of friends who I still play gameschat online with. Nothing. I was waiting around all day with my phone on me and not once did it buzz. I am totally fucking giving up on everything and am the loneliest I have ever been. I know I could just pick up the phone and call someone to do something but I do not want to do that when no one even bothers to check up on me for months even on my fucking 21st. Supposed to be an important milestone or whatever but these cunts in this shit hole town do not give a shit about me. Just want to move away and start my life again. Anyway its 3am and I just needed to get this out to someone even if its on reddit. Lockdown 21st,Depression

25992,26012,I have been going through a separation this year and started taking Zoloft mostly only 25 mg a bit earlier 7 months ago initially due to my first full blown panic attack. I am super sensitive to almost all pharmaceuticals and usually get the side effects only 35 experience usually sexual dysfunction suicidal ideations and out of character behavior. Like most SSRI's it worked well for me the first 3 months or so then started doing the opposite and the above side effects become more pronounced so I often stop after 4 or months. I tried many SSRI's when I was much younger and stopped them for a long time due to such experiences. This time was different and I really needed something fast for my sudden anxiety attacks. I stuck with it longer this time because I was afraid I would be more vulnerable with the separation pandemic financial stress all happening at once. But the Zoloft was starting to make me feel like I was in a permanent haze mornings have especially been difficult. I have zero energy until I have my coffee and Wellbutrin only 14 of a 75 mg pill. I have been taking the Wellbutrin the past 2 months to combat the lack of energy and ability to focus. My smoking weed and drinking both increased by 34 times in the last 2 months. They had both been creeping up since the separation but especially while living alone again the past 2 months. After tapering off for about 7 or 8 days I completely stopped the Zoloft 5 days ago. I am continuing with the Wellbutrin for now. In the last 3 days I have been experiencing sudden crying outbursts. Yes there are triggers and memories that set them off but how quickly in intensity it gets as well as the frequency every few hours is something new. Is this because of coming off Zoloft? How long does this usually last? Crying spells after quitting Zoloft?,Depression
11778,11798,I just lost 90 of my hard earned salary to some lucky dickhead in blackjack. I feel absolutely worthless and bad. I have always been unlucky and it makes me feel like i am actually cursed. I get a good deck my opponent has better. I get a deck below 16 and when i draw card i exceed 21. I get ace and 10picture my opponent gets it too. Why the heck am i so unlucky? Am i playing against a leprechaun? Every time i play whenever i actually do win it is very little compared to what i lose. I am a disgrace to my parents. Now i do not have enough money for my monthly expense and i have no motivation anymore so i just sleep or use my electronic the whole day in my locked dark room. I feel cursed,Depression
23403,23423,like I have been on my meds for a couple years now and i do not feel bad but every so often I get a suicidal thoughts. Sometimes I do feel down for maybe 23 days at most a week. So its like what the point of me getting med in first place. I am I do not work because I am A fuck up I ghost all my friends because I feel like I am dragging them down with my mood or me being any where make that place worse. It sucks that I cannot kill myself! Because I know my family will want to beary me and have some sort of service and they will waste their money on me and I do not want me more of burden more then I am all ready are. There no woods or place that close by enough that hide in so I can rot in peace in because I cannot drive and I know my family will know I am gone to soon and find me before I can find a secluded place and pick me up. An when they do I know they will know what I was going to do and feel bad and I do not want them to feel bad I just want to die.So for the rant I am just so tired of this. Like I do not want to say anymore I think I am just talking to myself because I am scared to do it. God I suck.Like what do I doI'm just so I do not feel down for long periods of time no more but I get suicidal thoughts sometimes,Depression
23921,23941,Hi everyone thanks for reading. My boyfriend has been depressed throughout his entire life. Some times are goodsometimes bad. Recently times have been bad as we are nearing graduation and he feels a lot of pressure. Most of this pressure comes from fear of failing time being short not making enough money and him being behind in his computer science career. Hes become pretty hopeless. He is an over thinker. He thinks about life and death a lot and often questions the meaning of life. Idk the answer to anything. He recently finished therapy for his anxiety and that has improved but his depression got worse. I try to be as patient supportive and understanding as I can. I have not really struggled with depression. But I am struggling with my own mental health recently because I am not used to thinking a lot of negative thoughts or things that I cannot answer. I love him and I want to be there for him. But I also want him and me to be happy. I know its not easy and I do not think it ever will be. I am just looking for some advice or encouragement on how to cope and stay strong and understand the right things to say when he asks the big questions or feels downoverwhelmed. Thanks. My 22F Boyfriend 22M of 5 years is depressed.,Depression
12810,12830,I am a 15 year old male i recently came home drunk and my mom caught me.I have been depressed for like half a year now but I have never managed to tell my parents i do not know why but its just hard to talk about i guess.when i got home my mom asked if i was drunk. I denied it. She then asked to smell my breath and she knew instantly. She had alcoholic parents growing up so she is good at knowing when somebody is drunk. She also went through my bag and found snus which is a kind of tobacco product.So i started crying and told her i needed help and that i was depressed. She said that she could help with that and get me a therapist. I was actually kind of relived that she caught me so i could finally get help. I was grounded for a few days and then went to my dads house the next week. And I have been back at moms house two times now for a week at a time. I think its been 3 weeks scince this.But my problem is that my mom has not said a thing about me being depressed and all that after that night. So I am not getting any help. Its not that she is a bad person and that she does not care. She is herself suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome so she is having a hard time.I think she might think it was an excuse for getting drunk. But now its back like it was before i cannot het myself to bring it up again.What should i do? What should i do?,Depression

9379,9399,Lately i am trying more and more to understand my depression. I almost daily get a drunk like feeling despite my last drink being months ago. When that feeling comes i feel wobbly on my feet my brain works at like 20 i cannot concentrate. Sometimes i even feel dizzy. Is that a symptom of depression? Drunk like feeling,Depression

16739,16759,Misplaced guilt but still not a great feeling. I have been trying to avoid reddit lately because it just is not a lot of fun the way I use it. Would be better if I could somehow meet people through this but something about meeting people online just weirds me out a bit. Not because I think I will meet weirdos more that it is just hard to believe that anyone will care about me. I feel like I really do not have a lot to offer. And with internet friends not that I have ever really had any it seems like it would be too easy for either of us to ghost and I would never see them again. If it was someone who lived in my city in australia who could actually be a reallife friend that would be something. I mean I would still worry about being too depressed to be worth it.And to be honest making friends is not really a priority for me until I find a partner. But anyway.I have this throwaway account and a regular one. I do not know what is up with the reddit notification system but I just scrolled back through out of boredom and between both accounts I have like 4 messages from people. All from like a year ago. Some of them were answering me responding to their r4r post. Girls my age who might have been something for me.I did not see any of those fucking messages and I feel awful about it. I could have been happier by now. I could have met someone. Guilt about social avoidance,Depression
11358,11378,That makes me really depressed and wanting to kill myself. idk how to digest it I feel bad about how I look and my life circumstances. genetics and societal beauty standard sucks.Like I do not really want to be alive while being like this yaknow? I am already alone without any personal support and dealing with my depression and social insecurities and this makes everything much more difficult for me.Being ugly to that degree just turns my human existence to shit. how am I supposed to deal with that??My life has been fucking hell and sometimes it feels like it keeps getting worse especially in social situations like that. My friend told me that if they had not known me they would be scared that I would rape and assault them during nighttime because I look uglycreepyscary,Depression
10855,10875,I feel so bored all the time and am too tired to live sometimes. I try to jack off but the pleasure only lasts so long. I feel like finding love would fix me but no one is nearby. I used to have joy in gaming but now it feels like a chore. What do I do? Honestly just bored with life.,Depression
24165,24185,I just cannot do it anymore. I do not want to watch my kids grow up in seperate homes. I want the time my ex took from me back. I did not get with someone just so they could leave like that. i deserve to be happy to.. why am I not allowed to be happy? I am sick of this. I need to get out of here before I finally cave in and kill myself. I feel like i am getting closer and closer... Because I have no one to talk to,Depression
9754,9774,I have been depressed since 2016 when I entered university. I always had high expectations in my life and thought the next thing would be my break. I have moved to 3 different places since then and am now in doctorates school and thought it would be done. I am constantly drunk hate my life and am completely alone. My family does not talk to me my friends do not talk to me and my boyfriend does not get me. How do I go on? I am on medication consistently for 2 months now and nothing helps. I have no will to keep up with this. When does it end?,Depression
14129,14149,I am just tired of everything i cannot sleep at night because i overthink about something that happend recently. Everyone says it will get better but its not getting better i do not know how to fix my life. I cannot feel any other emotion other than sadness. I am just tired,Depression
48091,48073,my depression keeps getting worse and i want to stop pushing away the people i love. 20MI feel like im slowly decaying. My mind slips i cant remember much anymore i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore at least not the ones that ive done already which is just about everything. I have all the desire in the world to get better but no motivation. I can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. I noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. It feels like a disease.My life just feels like im in limbo every day. I wake up do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. At night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. Its nothing horrifying or disturbing but they really bother me. Its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose.The thought that really bugs me the most the reason for making this post in the first place tells me to push people away. Not really in that exact manner but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. Everyone is normally completely fine but not during my episode. It makes me feel like a completely different person. It makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. Its similar for my friends. Im fine with them normally but during my episodes they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. But after i go to sleep and wake up everything is back to normal. I love my girlfriend and i like my friends. This thought didnt start happening until this month. I never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends and i always hated being alone and i still do which is how i can tell that im getting worse. Im just not me anymore im a completely different person than the one i used to know.The other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future and general sadness questions. Wondering if im ever going to live a stable life or if im going to feel happy and content ever again or if i will continue to be a failure forever. I always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually and i cant feel like this forever but most times its hard to convince myself. I cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. Im not suicidal i dont have a desire to stop living and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. But these episodes make it really difficult to be a living functioning person.I need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. I know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally but im afraid of them.,Depression

38246,38243,i don t know if i have depression anymore a few year ago i wa convinced i did since i didn t have much joy left in my hobby game or many show and i know when this thing all started back in primary school i m in uk there wa this autistic kid named patrick he appeared nice at the beginning but i had a bad feeling about him i felt bad that i did since he wa autistic and back then i wa told that you should never judge someone because of appearance or disability for that i wanted to be his friend along with everyone else after a few day of trying i realised why i had the bad feeling it turned out that patrick wa a bully and he always called me name and pushed me and hit me every time i wa even near him and of course i went to a teacher guess what they did drumroll nothing they said he couldn t help it because he wa autistic this went on for a year after a year of this the other boy in the class joined in and called me name and i only had friend through all of this let call one b and the other l when i wa hanging out with b she offered a sweet they had one of and i wa thankful for her kindness the next day b told l that i stole it from her and i now lost my only friend another year of this and still nothing but i had one friend we ll call her m m wa a girl i liked i matured fast after a while of hanging out with m i asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes month of more bullying but being with m i wa sad about not having friend but happy that i wa with m m slowly stopped hanging out with me and soon enough she started hanging out with b month later me and m were over m wa always talking to b i talked to no one i stopped going outside apart from school whenever m asked me to come outside i never said yes anymore i just sunk myself into a rabbit hole of youtube video p game and especially fortnite when it wa popular after summer holiday i went back to school and i gave up on making friend or doing work that year i always got mad whenever someone insulted me and i walked out of the classroom still teacher did nothing they actually called my carers and said i might have autism or anger issue absolutely ignoring the fact i wa being bullied right in front of them it definitely didn t help that the teacher for our class wa always on the girl side and soon enough i felt like i wanted to murder some of my classmate and i forgot to mention that i became friend with one of the boy that bullied me last year but he didn t really talk to me much after i started reading news story about depression abuse treatment of kid mental health etc and i came to the conclusion that adult couldn t help in this situation so i had to stop my anger before it even started i tried to stop sleeping because i thought if i wa tired enough my brain would be to weak to show emotion i soon enough had no friend didn t get much sleep didn t go outside apart from school and that s only through the course of and a half year primary i decided i wa gon na better myself and actually do my work i got to level in subject i talked to my friend more i became friend with m again after m and b had a fight they stopped being friend so in that year the teacher were the true problem and patrick of course let s call teacher one c and no d d wa the one i hated the most d intentionally made fun of the fact my dad left my mother when i wa born d also heard patrick call me name and hit me and breathe in my face multiple time i burst out of the room and went outside then d found me and acted like he didn t know what happened the deliberately said get back inside or i ll call your dad that made me so angry that i shouted right in his face and i went back inside angrily patrick still annoyed me and still teacher ignored it after covid erupted we went off school and it wa great skip to primary and patrick finally started getting in trouble by one teacher only teacher c after a while of him actually getting in trouble he came up with a plan he decided to tell teacher c to go home and kill themself and when it happened teacher c went out with watering eye and the head teacher came in and said to him patrick that s not nice don t say it again teacher c still got him in trouble and he gave up on stopping her nothing much happened that year he still bullied me but i tuned all of it out since i couldn t care anymore nor could i get angry anymore all my anger wa used up now i m in s and people call me emo just because of my long fringe no one want to be friend with me everyone annoys me for no reason most of my primary school friend are no longer talking to me i gave up do i have depression,Depression
24198,24218,Do people really think this is helpful?

26324,26344,That after all the pain suffering and misery I have put others and myself through that it is not my calling in life. I have been there done that and I am not about it at all. I vow to try to help people from here on out and to help myself in relation. I think a lot of you put yourselves down so much for your past bullshit that you do not realize it either. But like the quote goes always look for the helpers because they are always there and I would prefer to help then to hurt at this point in my life. I have caused enough troubles now I want to try to be a solution to other ppl's problems. I may not make it far and I may fail but as long as I gave it my best honest shot from this moment forward I can rest easy. I realized something today...,Depression
47424,47409,I'm suicidal and it's not emotional or anything it's just an option to me that I see myself taking So numb it just feels like any other daily task like taking a shower or washing dishes or whatever. I've come close to it but just decided to watch youtube or something else that is more fun get to it later. I say I'll get to most things later.I don't have a future I don't want to explain it fully because I have a thousand times I just don't. I don't got family like other people I will be pulled out of school eventually I'm gonna be in foster care starting within this year I have a lot of trauma and life long medical problems. I feel like an animal that should be euthanized already. I am in constant suffer. My autism is a large factor. I do try to be happy it is something I want. I also want to feel sad because it means I cared enough about something to become sad over it right now I feel nothin. I wish hope would drive me but there's no use in hoping in my situation.Trying though. Practicing good hygiene my acne is clearing up taking breaks from school when needed good dose for my pills puzzles sports etcetera. Might improve so far nothing unfortunately.

8227,8247,Just when I think I am starting to get better and get a hold of my anxiety amp depression something triggers me and I am back to feeling an immense amount of pain and suicidal thoughts. Its so scary when you are brain is constantly telling you that you are better off dead. I do not really want to die I want to be somewhat at peace with myself and just live a decent life. It feels like that is just not going to happen for me. Sometimes I truly think that I was destined to commit suicide. I am hanging on by a thread at this point and as time goes on the hope I have left gets smaller and smaller. I cannot make any friends due to social anxiety and now spend almost all my days alone. I think I have a decent personality but no one ever gets to see it because of my sa. I feel like everyone just hates me. what is the point of life if you cannot even make meaningful relationships with people? I do not want to die but I do not want to be alive either. So tired of trying to get better and constantly being knocked down. My depression has me in a chokehold rn and I am trying so hard to not end it. I deserve to be happy and live a good life. I am not giving up on myself yet Just when I think I am getting better,Depression
15651,15671,I am at fucking breaking point.. I seriously cannot stand it I am not strong enough to go through another week. I cannot be taken for granted anymore I cannot be treated like this anymore I cannot be a fucking punching bag for the people I love anymore... I do not have it in me anymore its over I cannot fucking do it!! I want to fucking die.. I do not see a way forward I do not see the point anymore. I am so full of anger there is so much I want to say to certain people in my life but I am too scared of what they will do or say to me. They would not physically harm me but the things they say the isolation then after it I am already so lonely if I say how much they fucking hurt me they will either ignore me for days or not see me for weeks and I cannot handle that!! I have already been so alone through all the lock downs for the 14 months.. I do not know how to let them say the horrible shit they do and just take it on the chin. I used to lash back. I used to fight back but now I am broken. I will end up fully alone if I fight back anymore If I stand up for myself I will end up alone with my thoughts. My thoughts will be the end of me. I will have to remember all the trauma that is happened in the past. I will be alone with nothing to take my mind off it.. But if I stay quiet then I will not be alone and ill get to escape this pain for another kind of pain. Only.. I do not know which is worse anymore. I feel invisible... No one actually knows just HOW much they hurt me with the things they say. Now I want to hide from the people I love most because they make me hate myself more than I already do. The worst part is.. They have not said anything to me that I have not already said to myself... No one hates me more than I do.. But hearing them also say the things I have said to myself?? Well I guess I had a sliver of hope that it was not that way. But it is. The only way I will make it is if I disconnect... I have started already and I think people are starting to notice they say things like oh I wish you could talk to me about how you are feeling it is a shame you cannot vent to me.. but what do they honestly fucking expect.. They have seen how unhappy I am when I say how I feel they fight with me over it!!!!! I do not know why I am writing this.. I do not want attention I do not want to seem like I am an attention seeker but I guess this feels like a diary.. I know this is all over the place I am just saying what is in my head at this point. I can say what I feel and no one knows who I am. No one will ever know. Jesus fucking christ I do not think I can do this anymore....,Depression
17122,17142,it is clear to me after 8 years that I am stuck in the same situation. I will never try to do anything to find a job or relationship or a house to live alone. I will never become independent not because I cannot but because I do not want to. I want to stay with my mom forever alone with my books in my room like a teen and go out only with her. I cannot take responsibilities I cannot make decisions not because I am stupid but they make me feel so anxious and panicked and I do not know how to manage this. I still remember 8 years ago when I tried to rent a house to stay alone twice and I panicked too much and in the end I cancel it. I still remember how I felt 10 years ago when I attempted to live alone in another city for studies and how depressed and alone I was. The furnitures my parents bought are still haunted me whenever I see them in my grandma's house. And maybe I was 18 years old and I had to deal with a very difficult situation in my house but I am still unable to take action.My situation does not make me happy I feel bored I want to do something different and exciting but I cannot. I cannot even think to live as an adult to have a romantic relationship or a stable job because I am afraid of all the conflicts that may occur. Maybe these things have to offer me exciting things but I am aware that as more you expose yourself and take responsibilities you have also more problems to deal with. And I had enough problems in my life already.Some may think that I am immature or spoiled or sheltered and the last two I believe that are true but I am not immature at all. This maybe is the problem that I do not get never excited because I overanalyze things and try to see all the different perspectives. People around me rent houses without second thought say lies thst they have experience to take a job and generally grab chances without thinking it a lot. Even if they do wrong they do not punish theirselves and they do not feel bad if in the process they treat unfairly some people. I cannot even sleep thinking all my past wrong decisions I am not able to say a lie even for the most unimportant thing. I am unable to deal with anything or to put it correctly I cannot deal with my feelings. Even when someone hear sent me a private message I get panicked I do not know how to react and I think of that all the time. I can start a conversation when I am too desperate and I know that maybe I will not be alive long enough but sooner or later I start to fear that someone is going to harm me or discover or harass me etc. This is probably the main problem I am so afraid of everything and even if I fight it and try to make steps in the end I always go back to my parents security even if it is toxic. And I feel relieved and I can sleep at nights but I also feel so desperate and empty. it is not my fault that I feel this way. My father is a negative person and make me feel afraid of the works and people because he always showed me the worst case scenario. My mom tried to protect me and give me moments of entertainment and not let him spread his negativity but she is also a victim and a depressed person and life was not easy for her. Our life in general was not never easy many bad incidents happened to our family put of out control and these made my father even more convened for his worldview. I do not know what is wrong with me is my traumas my ocd my social anxiety? Do I have the Peter pan syndrome and I want to stay child forever? Am I autistic and that is why I find the world so terrified? Is my county and how unorganized and corrupted everything is here that make me feel so desperate? I feel like my life has an expire date. I do not know if I commit soon or no but I know that when my mom dies this will be my end also. Maybe I will end everything sooner because there is no point I feel so miserable and I just waste money. Therapy and medication never were helpful on the contrary the made everything worse. I waste so much time in this crap and also in fortune telling seeking desperately an answer but now I realize that everything is bllshit. I hate myself that still believe in something higher either is the God or something else because this enabling my ocd and I still try to make decision with random ways not with my mind. I will never move forward,Depression

14783,14803,I am so tired of trying to spread myself thin and make sure everyone is alright when I feel like inside I am fucking screaming for help myself!!!!! I just wish people would realise I need a break too and leave me the fuck alone!!!!!The folk i want to be around me leave me and the ones I do not want hang around like a bad smell bringing me further and further down and I just cannot bare this shit anymore. I just want someone to cuddle me and tell me shit is going to be alright instead of push me away because I am no ones priority! Heart broken!!!,Depression
11612,11632,I wish I could feel happy for than an hour ata time Things are going so so good for me rn my grades are super high I ended the semester with distinctions for both my modulesMy relationship is actually perfect and I am with the person I want to be with forever I honestly cannot thing of a single thing wrong in my life rnSo I should be the happiest I have ever been right? Coz everything is going so good.So why now am I crying myself to sleep every night? Cutting more than I ever have? Thinking about ending my life more than ever?It really sucks to think that no matter how good things get I am never going to get any happier. So what is the point even trying anymore? what is the point,Depression
26887,26907,I realize most of this is highly subjective to everyone but I am sure at least one of these points will sound familiar. You can no longer just walk into a video store and pick out something that looks cool. With sites like Ebay or amazon it takes away the social aspect. You cannot have deeper meaningful time with family or friends because everyone is always updating their life on social media and nobody cares about what is going on around them anymore. To follow that everyone lacks discipline and attention spans. Malls used to be a cool fun place to meet friends but with corporate giants like Amazon...well you see the issue. People seem to have a very hard time staying on topic. Social media has created positive feedback loops that encourage one to spout opinions and tell stories instead of further the conversation. People now crave onesided conversations because they need the validation of their life story being liked. Depression...itself. I feel like social media romanticizes and makes fun of people with depression a bit. I can go on and on for another hour but these ones stand out to me the most. The internet is a very useful tool and not the actual issue. The problem is that social media takes away the connection we used to have to each other and for me I feel like if I had more connections with people outside of the internet my life as well as many other's would be much better off. I think the reason I have depression as well as many other people is because society is ruined due to social media taking away real emotions from people.,Depression
23301,23321,I feel like I have been taken advantage of my whole life. I was molded into this helper figure that everyone just uses and toss away once they are finished.

Why are you being like this? That questions just make me feel worse. Random thought,Depression
15504,15524,I realize I am in a level of depression where I am fine until I start thinking. I have to be constantly distracted. Cohabitation with certain people and internet help but I am so deep in it I have to push away the thoughts that are real. Thoughts of grief thoughts of trauma fear of the futures in which I am not sure if I will be able to afford to live. I do not have the money to get help or get back on my medications. Legally I am homeless at the moment which is something that unfortunately is not a new thought. I cannot help but feel like things will not get better but worse. How can I succeed if I am depressed? How can I make money if I do not succeed? Why try to fight what time has shown me I cannot? Broke and depressed,Depression
19219,19239,Sorry if this does not fit in this sub but I feel like I need to tell people that would understand what is happening. I have always been suspicious I was depressed and anxious but I never felt the symptoms or physical sensations I would read about. After my first panic attack I feel like I am always in my head worrying about the next one to come. I cannot even get out of bed for work a lot of the time because I just feel like shit. I do not feel like myself and everything feels like I am in limbo just watching my life go by. It feels like a dream.Or I get hyper aware of my bodys functions that should happen naturally. Like I am manually processing everything going through my brain. I sometimes think I can accidentally hit the off switch to my brain and it scares the shit out of me. These episodes make me get existential and I feel hopeless as a result.I do not want to die but the feeling of nothing feeling real or my hyper awareness scares me into thinking that its going to happen soon. I hope there is someone out there that can relate and know that you are not alone. Had my first panic attack from edibles now I feel like I am going to die almost everyday.,Depression

10342,10362,I do not know how to deal with all of them. Medication citalopram did not help and it made me dizzy so I quit. Its been almost 3 years since my burnout started and I had to quit college and my job but I am still showing no signs of recovery. Its driving me nuts.In 20172018 I worked so hard to lose weight 75 lbs and succeeded. Now I gained more back like 80 lbs then I lost and my therapists any told me that there is nothing I can do about that at the moment. But I have already been waiting 2 years and 8 months. I am at my wits end.I am slowly seeing myself gaining more and more weight which is absolutely ruining my mental and physical health. I am too afraid to go outside in daylight because I am scared people I know will see I gained all of the weight back. Especially the people who used to bully me. My therapist recommended focusing only walking 15 minutes at night but that is already really tiring for me. It makes me really dizzy and tired. I only succeeded in doing it for one week recently I have been thinking I do not want to live anymore so often and its scaring me. I feel like I am out of options.

25190,25210,So recently my mum who lives in the same neighborhood as me told me she runs out onto the street panicking every time she hears the horns of an ambulance slowing down where we live. She walked the dog the other day in the forest close to our street and there was loads and loads of police cars arriving and they closed most of it down when she asked why they said there was a suicide. She had to be taken to the hospital because she had a huge panick attack thinking it must have been me. I need to get better just for her. I need to. I need to get better,Depression

17711,17731,that is depression. The world cannot toss and turn you at its leisure forever. Eventually you will hit a point where you will literally selfdecimate. When none of your efforts have any impact whatsoever when the world just pounds and destroys you for reasons beyond your understanding over and over and over and over despite the Hurculean energy you exert with every fibre of your beingampx200Byou give up. There is a limit. There is a point where people just fucking can not tolerate things anymore and will break.,Depression

10913,10933,I M16 cannot help but think about killing myself. Just had an argument with my mum and she is basically said to change my attitude or find somewhere else to live. I cannot help having a temper on me. She said that i shout at my sister which i do not i just raise my voice bc she ignores me bc she is 2 and i said that she shouts at her sometimes to so she screams I am HER MOTHER YOUR JUST HER BROTHERShe also says i do not acknowledge what she does. A few examples are she brought me new clothes online i said ty when she paid and when i went to bed one night i saw them on my bed and thought 'ill say ty tomorrow night as i will not see her in the morning' but i forgot.I got home from work went to my room to get changed and saw she made me a pillow so i thought 'ill say ty when i go downstairs' got changed really needed the toilet and once i finished i forgot.She asked if i wanted a doorstop making i said no and on the same day she made the pillow she made me a doorstop which i did not realise until i went to bed. Thought 'ill say ty tomorrow night' and i forgot.She mentioned these and said that I am ungreatful and i said that i did see them i just forgot to say ty and she said its alright ill just forget to wash your clothes. that is not forgetting that is pulling my clothes and only my clothes out the washing machine and not washing them. I cannot help forgetting things I am only human. She complains that I am always miserable and tells me to cheer up its not that easy.Atleast once a day she says smth i do not find particularly nice or gets me to do smth i do not want to. With it being so hot in the UK over the past week or so i got a rash on my back and she wanted me to take my shirt off which i did not want to i get told to wear shirt which i do not like doing she says my breath always stinks cuz i never brush my teeth coming back to the forgetting everything. there is alot.And most of the things she says i could say back. I do t brush my teeth she does not shower. I am always on my phone so is her partner. I do t do chores around the house properly she never cleans up the dirt after sweeping or puts her plate in the dishwasher. there is even occasions where she spils my dribk and complains to me cuz i put it there. Why do rules apply to 'children' but nkt adults???She also says that I am not 'motivated enough at work'. Why would i be? I have to get up at 6am the 3 days i work and do a job that is built for ppl who have double the muscles as i do. And she says that i need to always be doing smth not just be standing there. Yet sometimes that is all i can do. E.g. someome is cutting hedges and I am going behind them ckearing it up sometimes i have to wait She does not know i have depression suicidal thoughts or that i sh. She does not realise. Can anyone give any advice to be atleast a little more happiermotivated? And do not say smth like it will get better cuz that will just tip me over the edge. I want to die,Depression

Health insurance does not cover the treatment my dr wanted and if it was not for the cost I would probably admit myself to some kind of psych ward while on medical leave. I just do not know what to do with these restrictions. I wish the answer was as simple as a brain scan see what is wrong fix the problem. I just have that deep pain of dread in my chest and it has been a long time. I do not know what else to do,Depression

26304,26324,So recently I feel so less energetic like half the man I use to be. I do not have any motivation either it seems. I nap a lot go to sleep late. Everyday in the same. And my vision has this weird thing to where I feel like I have had 23 beers like a buzzed vision field. Everything just seems bleh. Its harder to do everyday activities and this next part sounds nasty but oh well. I use to be the most higenijc person ever but lately its hard to feel the need too. I feel like not me its harder to be social as well. I just do not know. Is this depression?,Depression
22730,22750,I have a friend who is currently losing a lot of friends within her life and is in a bad emotional state. We were planning on dating but decided its best for us to stay as friends. She has depression and takes medication for it but I do not have depression. I thought it might be best to leave her alone for a little bit. I do not fully understand depression so I am not sure what to do. We just started being friends like 3 weeks ago What should I do?,Depression
9287,9307,Everything just feels so hopeless. The days are all blending together. Two weeks passes in the blink of an eye and I still have not left my apartment still working from homestill broke. I spend every day doing the same thing. I hate my at home job so much when I am through with work I either sleep or just stare at the ceiling. I have no joy anymore or any will to engage in my passionshobbies. My most exciting outing the pst few months was getting a tooth pulled. I do not leave my apartment because I have no friends and anything I need I can get delivered. My job is basically to be a verbal punching bag since I work for a corrupt company. I have spent many nights longing for a friend willing to check in on me or come see me. No new messages read one week ago. I have just come to accept no matter how hard I try I will never have friends. If it were not for my boyfriend who lives with me I would have ended it a while ago he is the only thing that takes my loneliness away even for a moment. But even he has no clue what goes through me head every day and I am getting worse. Time is standing still,Depression
13355,13375,So my older brother is 26 and he shames me for not having a license and just now getting my first job at 19. I feel like he fails to realize that he had it easier at my age since our parents were still together when he was 19 so he had access to a car since he was 16. Our parents started splitting up when I was 16 and at the time I was doing high school and college at the same time since I was in dual enrollment so I already had my hands full with double the work and dealing with a toxic environment my brain just could not handle anything else. Then after I graduated I went away for school for a year and man was it hard during this pandemic. I recently got back about 2 months ago and turned 19 and decided I would take a gap year to find a job and transfer to a school closer because my goal is to get my license and commute to save . But how do I just ignore his words??? It hurts especially bc hes my sibling and it feels like everyone turned their back on me and I feel dumb for not knowing everything and for not having it all figured out at my age. Its really discouraging. Being shamed and looked down onto by family member,Depression

18698,18718,You know what I really hate ? it is when you lower your expectations so much yet you are always hit with a new level of surprise. You start making excuses for your dearest It just happens that my lows catch them on their busy time and I understand really well that I am not entitled to anyone's support not financially or anything just a simple cheering up but this simply cannot keep happening especially since in my case even when I try to distance myself because of the feeling of betrayal they always comeback when they are in their lows and I simply never turn an eye on that because up until recently I thought that is the norm yet time goes by and the same circle repeats itself. We all have problems because sure life is a bitch but it is just so much harder that the moment you are ready to fight them just the knowledge that the people you thought would be there are not you lose your footing to a scary degree. I have always overcame my depressive episodes but doing it for myself is not going to work forever. I have caught on hobbies stayed away from any kind of addiction focused on my carreer but none of them seem to work long term simply because this is a personal battle never have I had one single suicidal thought that I could brush off with oh but you will never be a world class guitarist or artist if you do so. Those make a great way to pass time and change the perspective too but they do not stop it from happening. At least not for me. I really want to learn to love life I appreciate so many things the strays that come for petting and as much as I know the next lound sound going to scare them at this point I could almost count on them more than I count on people. I am just tired of all of this. I am sorry for the long post this is was just something I needed to get out of my chest. there is something sinister in being used to feeling abandoned,Depression
15582,15602,I have a hard time figuring out if I am just out of sorts and do not know how to deal with things or if its something more like depression. How do you know?

22886,22906,This is as close I can describe my feelings or lack of them.I suffered from mild to moderate depression over 10 years I am male turning 30 soon. I was on antidepressants but they did not help much so I stopped them years ago. There were times when things were good. Now I wake up every morning and I feel I lack purpose even though I have more money than I need. When I was depressed and poor I kept thinking money will solve all problems so I focused on making money and it really did make me feel less depressed... for awhile.After that the depression came back but now it cannot be managed. I do not feel less depressed if I buy anything car clothes or whatever I feel like absolutely nothing brings me joy.People sometimes offer me to go out and do something and sometimes I go but I feel bored all of the time like is this all there is to life?I do not like the way people are these days mindless consumers that lost their mind on making money. As Jim Carrey said I wish everyone to make them so you understand that this is not the real answer.I cannot let people inside my life easily so my romantic life also suffers. I enjoy the small things walking in the park alone looking at the sunset or sitting at my apartment looking at the mountain sometimes I also travel but I feel I wasted my life. From the outside people always tell me You did so much but I feel absolutely worthless. Sometimes I think if it is my time to go and I do not have kids I will just donate everything to some hospital and that is it since I do not like most of my relatives.I feel alone and without real purpose. My friends are getting married having babies and so on and I am alone in this world.I am not looking exactly for advice I just wanted to vent out. Wish all the best to everyone here Emptiness,Depression

11316,11336,As soon as I start to feel comfortable with the way I look I start to notice all my flaws again and then feel stupid for even thinking I was pretty in the first place. I am just so tired of always comparing myself to other women my age and feeling like Ill never be good enough for anyone because I am not as beautiful or as fit as them. I am sick of being so insecure that I always think any man I am with would leave me for someone else because I am far from being as pretty as some of the girls I see. Or Ill see these women and feel bad for my so because they are with me when they could be with someone so much better. I hate feeling ugly all the damn time and idk how to stop. But then when I do feel good about myself I question if I am really as pretty as I think I am or if I am just lying to myself. I just want to feel beautiful in my own skin and I want to stop comparing myself to other girls. It fucking sucks because I know my heart would break if someone told me they felt this way about themselves so why is it so fucking hard for me to stop hating myself? I do not want to live the rest of my life thinking I am this hideous mofo. And even if I am a hideous mofo I want to be comfortable with who I am because its tiring to want to be someone else all the time. I just want to be ME and be happy with who I am.

19450,19470,When people talk about depression its usually about the sadness part or loss of interest and distancing. But one big factor of it is the loneliness. That feeling that you are alone. No matter how loving friends and family are and supportive that loneliness is still there. It eats at you making your self consciousness to kick in. Making you hate yourself making you think that you are a failure that no one will ever love you. It truly hurts. Its an emptiness inside you that you feel cannot be filled. Nothing takes away this pain for long. Its tiring and draining. I want to curl up in a ball and cry but i cannot. I have to fake it. Fake being happy fake being warm and fuzzy. Fake a smile fake enjoyment. Fake everything. I just want it to end. I just want to stop feeling so alone in this world. I just want to feel loved and appreciated. I want to be understood. I want to be cared for. But my mind will not let me reach out to people. It will not let me get the help i need. I always hold back the truth. No matter who I am talking too. I am so drained and i just want to stay in bed all day but I cannot because I have responsibilities. Why did this have to happen to me. Why do i have to live with this thing that constantly eats away at me. Why do i have to go through my day like nothing is wrong. why does my medicine not work. it just makes me numb. the only thing that I have experienced that has actually helped it the gym and weed. and i cannot do those things all day every day. I just want to be happy again. i just want this all to end. My depression,Depression
25661,25681,I 21 M . Last year since the lockdown started my life was litrally the same as it was before lockdown! it was then I realised how anti social amd how lonely I was. and due to some issues and stupid things I did in the past my depression was extreme that i really wished to get corona and die I lost the will to live ..but after a year of staying inside house and realising how loving great family and blessings I have my depression litrally became worse because there are people in the worst of worst conditions living happily and I cannot be like that even though I am previleged I feel like I do not deserve all this blessings and i am a total loser. the depression is getting better but I still do not have the will to live no matter how hard i try i really do not want to proceed with life... when i see accident victims and soldiers suffering to survive i really wonder how do they have such will to live ? Had it been me i would have happily accepted death with both hands! Seriously how to gain the will to live? How to gain the will to live?,Depression
10149,10169,This year has been a bit challenging emotionally. I am not really sure where to go with this as I hate burdening my loved ones with really unhappy things so for now I am just going to yell into the void of Reddit so I can organize all my thoughts and get them out. In short I am extremely unhappy with the person I seem to be recently. Its almost like I was a different person last year and even the year before that especially. I was happier. Everything was generally okay. Life felt good for the most part. And now for the past 6 or 7 months or so I have been largely a hot mess.It does not make much sense because things are good right now. I should be happy. In December I moved into my own place with my partner who I love dearly and everything between us is wonderful. We adopted a cat. I was able to find a job here in our new town right after moving. I have made acquaintances despite my horrible social anxiety. In theory everything is wonderful. But for some reason despite all that I have spent the grand majority of this time going through cycles of misery. My selfesteem has hit an all time low and that is saying something. I frequently put myself down. I feel like a failure despite my accomplishments. I have been crying almost daily or at least several times a week. I seem to cry way more easily now because I used to only cry every once in a while. I have many moments almost on the daily where I just feel very sad angry or grumpy. Sometimes my entire day will be ruined by one small thing and I will turn into an irritable unfun person for pretty much the rest of the day. I hate being this way. It cannot be fun for my loved ones and its certainly not fun for me. I have been withdrawing from keeping in touch with friends too. Deep down I am afraid they secretly do not want to hear from me. I know how ridiculous that sounds but I cannot help thinking it.I am not sure if this is depression or what. I have struggled with anxiety and OCD since I was a child but I have never been to a psychologist about this specific issue. And now I am in a small town so access to in person therapy is rough to find. I am looking for telehealth options but in the meantime I am unsure what to make of myself lately. Sometimes I worry I am just overreacting but it cannot be okay to feel this way so consistently... right? Does this sound normal or is it worth seeking help?,Depression
22836,22856,I keep having this anxious feelingthought...Why does not everyone give up when things get hard? Why does not everyone just kill themselves? How can anyone be happy?

12635,12655,I cannot stop cutting really badly I made a huge gaping one about an hour ago that extends from one end of my arm to the other end and I have hastily half glued half stitched it up. I keep saying this but it keeps happening...this one is the worst so farLike... To think before a few months ago I had not done it past cat scratches and now I am going super overboard... I burned myself for the first time like last week I do not understand how I have gotten it this bad and the worse I do it the worse I feel like I need to do it next time I am having dreams that I am cutting arms off. I have had 4 attempts on my life this year and I feel like only one time I was not fully serious about it the other three times were serious attempts and the feeling afterwards is so shameful and embarrassing.How do I get the nasty voice out of my head telling me to keep trying to die? it is not always there but when it comes I cannot get out of it I do not end up feeling sad just numb... And then I do something really dangerous. Is it because I have made it a self fulfilling prophecy to not live to see next year? How much longer do I have to cry every day? I had a therapist come over today but it was really weird because we could not hear each other properly through our masks. Self harmsuicide vent,Depression

8617,8637,The past few weeks I have been feeling really bad just for no reason and recently I developed an extreme hatred for myself. Like inside of me splits into half and half of me take myself as my own enemy. I talked to my GP my counsellor and the Samaritans I take the tablets and tried suggestions they gave me but it all did not work really well. Like those things only help me at that moment but in the end it all comes back to where it was and started draining me out. I try to keep myself calm during the day but at night while everyone is asleep that is when I get extremely mad at myself like I am losing my mind. I have to bitecut myself so the pain calms me down but I know this is not right and cannot be a longterm solution.

Everything is just overwhelming me. I recently noticed when I brush my teeth and wash my face 2x a day I feel more normal. Even though its simple. I just feel more together and less depressed.

23799,23819,Some details he is in his early 30s. he is living with my parents as well as working for them at their small business. he is been to university and colleges but never completed any degrees. He shuts himself away from everyone it is extremely difficult to contact him to reach him this is by his design. He is overweight and spends most of his free time playing videogames mostly WoW. He smokes multiple joints a day and is on no other medication.I love my brother dearly and I want to try and help him help himself. I try to stay connected with him in the only way that I can which is through setting up weekly video gaming sessions with him where on a Friday we will spent 5h or so playing through Dark Souls or Bloodborne or something that requires a lot of communication and coordination between us. he is happiest when he and I are kicking ass or have vanquished an invader. Sometimes I try to ask him how he is doing inside and if he spends time talk to himself but he literally shuts me down and then goes silent for hours at a time. I see a therapist for my own issues and that work that I have done there has helped me a lot. I believe that he sees his own situation as being so dire that he cannot fathom a way out. He does not get along well with my parents he is extremely bad tempered and lashes out to them. They do not know how to handle him at all and the situation is completely out of their control or emotionalmental ability to resolve. They all need help tbh but it has to begin with my brother in my opinion which is not a professional opinion by any means. In August I am going to visit them for two weeks. I am bringing my dog with me who I hope will help soften my brother a bit as he is genuinely kind hearted and loves animals. My goal is to try and find some time to allow him to open up and share his thoughts and feelings but he seems so hardened and up until now I have failed time and time again to get him to open up. How can I help my brother? What can I do to let him know that I care deeply for him and his wellbeing and that I want him to seek the help he needs to begin taking back control of his life.And to my bro if you are reading this and somehow have figured out it is me please know that I am there for you buddy. I believe my adult brother has depression and undiagnosed ADHD. I live 12h driving away. How can I help him when he does not want any help?,Depression

20046,20066,The days just float by. I want to hit the reset button and start life over. I have isolated myself to the point where I feel like a stranger at family gatherings. I have no rl friends aside my loyal and loving girlfriend who does her best to encourage me to make new friendships but it is near impossible without me just wanting to shut down. My mother passed away recently as well and it is made it that much harder to put on a brave face to the world. I do not know if ranting about it on the internet will help me feel better but it is nice to let my constantly racing mind have an outlet for a change Numb,Depression

I am currently on disability and if I could work again I doubt I would have the ambition I used to. I have not tried getting a job since before the accident in 2015. The system is slowly dying and crumbling and I could not be happier. I used to work a white collar job before my accident but I cannot multi task anymore due to a traumatic brain injury. it is because of a drunk driver I am a she will of what I used to be. I am actually happy that drunken piece of shit died in a separate incident. Just waiting on the collapse ya'lll I am waiting for society to collapse.,Depression

11452,11472,I do not know why but it hurt so much. Just the feeling that someone that I once considered my best friend and someone that I had so many memories with just did not care.I knew that he would agree with me but it really hurt me that I poured my heart out saying how fun it has been and he just replies with a single sentence.I do not know man I just feel so sad about it for no reason and really needed somewhere to vent. I just told my friend of 5 years that we are not as close anymore and I wrote an entire paragraph to end things on good terms and all I got was okay have a good life,Depression
11746,11766,Hi everyone I wanted to write this to see whether or not people feel the same or whether or not I am going crazy. Basically I am a 26 year old male and I am feeling bogged down by life and quite miserable. To give some background I still live at home with parents I have a fairly decent job a girlfriend and a small group of close friends however over the past few years I have been struggling to feel content with life. I live in the uk and from a young age I have always craved adventure and living a exciting life. During my late teens and early 20s I have lived abroad travelled the south east been on multiple holidays but there is something I cannot quite put my finger on as to why I feel unhappy with life at the moment.Over the past few years transitioning from being a happy go lucky university student to then entering the real world has been a real struggle for me. The area I live has very little work opportunities and is known to be a less desirable part of the UK to live in. I feel that everyone does the same predictable routine of working a job they hate Monday Friday and then drink heavily on a weekend to numb the pain and then repeat myself included. I really feel I am growing out of the uks drinking culture and want to completely change my lifestyle.I just feel that there has to be more to life than this. The majority of people I know are looking to get their first house engagement and to settle down but the thought of settling for this existence really scares me. I feel guilty for feeling this way like I should be grateful that I have been dealt a fairly comfortable life. A week holiday once a year an ok wage food in the fridge and a caring family but I cannot help feeling that there has got to be more to life than this. I crave community travel adventure good relationships passion excitement. But at the moment I feel dull and like the energy has been sucked out of me through joining the 95 rat race and falling into the trap that everyone does.I suppose the reason for writing this was to understand whether it is normal to feel like this?Is this just what growing up is all about? If anyone had any tips on how to change this mindset of these circumstances?Is it unrealistic to think life can be exciting all of the time?Thanks for reading and I would be grateful if anyone had any tips or pointers or even just to find if anyone is in the same boat! Feeling lost at 26,Depression
27270,27290,Then again money does not matter if you are dead.I am just saying when you want say a new pair of shoes when you already have 5 nice pairs... Do you think about not getting them for the fact that you are suicidal and they will just be ANOTHER thing someone has to get rid of after you are gone? Or do you buy them and enjoy them even if you will be gone tomorrow?I am having trouble enjoying my life without feeling bad for making my mom buy me things I want. Because in the end it could all be a waste of money. Money we do not have.I do not know how much sense that makes but please someone tell me they think this way too. Ever want something really bad but then remember you feel like dying and it would not be worth the money?,Depression
19446,19466,I can no longer concentrate on books or comprehend text by reading and its been persistent for years. Before my depression I used to read only once and all the information was grasped easily. Now i have to read the same sentence again and again in order to grasp it is meaning and still forget all of it. Also i noticed I cannot take up information if i am watching a movie like i forget earlier plot of the movie and cannot correlate it with the present even with subtitles i have hard time comprehending. Does depression because difficulty with reading comprehension skills and slow processing issues? Or is it just a different issue which i should look into further? What meds can help with reading comprehension issues? cannot focus or comprehend reading.,Depression
8041,8061,Always being busy for the entire day has helped me shift my focus. I have taken up a lot of hobbies just so that I could fill my day that I do not have time to overthink. Yes I still have suicidal thoughts and do go back from time to time. But this method has helped me to reduce the severity of those situations. Another thing that has really helped me is learning to enjoy the nature like when it is raining or you are going for a walk in a sunny day. I do recommend learning to ride a bike because it has helped me a lot. My friends forced me to go outside and learn riding. It is not going to work wonders but the sense of control to be able to control the pace at which everything is moving on the open road really helps you calm down it just helps you be at peace. This is just something that worked for me,Depression
7794,7814,I am just tired of everything and want to stop existing. This shit sucks and I would rather not be here.

Honestly fuck everything,Depression
25442,25462,When it is really more like being really really really bored with everything and anything all the goddamn time. Like you just cannot muster the strength to do anything because it just sounds... boring. Video games sound boring school sounds boring work sounds boring showering sounds boring literally everything. Laying in bed is boring too but I do not have to do shit except lay there. I hate this feeling because I always know it is when a bout of depression is hitting me. Time to be fucking bored and lonely for the next 6 months I guess. it is weird how media portrays depression as sadness...,Depression
15018,15038,I go back to work today had some time off for mental health body issues alcohol depression you name it... and I am absolutely terrified anxiety levels are not okay. I honestly do not know how people work stressful jobs stay sober and keep health a priority. It sounds pathetic that I am 29 years old and still find adulting so hard. I just feel like there has to be more than this. The endless loop of dragging your ass to work being excited to have time off work then dreading the next work day so much you cannot even enjoy your time off. I dunno... I am ranting here. Work life balance.,Depression

16287,16307,Hey all so today my cat passed away who I have had for almost 9 years and I am just taking it really hard. When I adopted him he was so full of energy and love and just attached to me and I felt like we had a very strong bond. He knew whenever I was upset and would just be with me and try and comfort me when I was sad. He helped me through some really tough times over the years. Back 4 years ago I found a squishy lump on his back that ended up being a spindle cell tumor. We got him surgery to get it removed multiple times but ultimately it just kept coming back until it was inoperable as of a year ago. The past 6 months have been the worst though. We tried administering him chemo which made him lose all of his weight energy and sapped away his personality he would just lay there all depressed. Then about 2 months ago we noticed the tumor on his back died and decayed away and left a crater in his back. I figured he needed to be put down then and there but the vet would not do it because they still thought he had time. So we tried keeping him clean and took him off the chemo to have him try and be himself for his remaining days. He smelled so bad though like death that it was hard for me to be around him and I feel so guilty about it. Well today he lost all of his strength had a stroke and died at home. I feel like I lost my best friend. I keep looking for him and just want to spend time with him but he is gone now. To make matters worse we had cats in the past who were also very sick that we tried caring for and died in almost similar ways and had the same amount of time with us. I miss them all but this cat today Astro makes me feel like I am now lost and I do not know what to do. I lost my cat today.,Depression
20321,20341,Everytime a conversation starts I keep silence hide myself and suddenly disappear from the chat. I do not want to talk with more than one person a time I cannot do it anymore. Actually I think this is becoming a fear to me like fear of groups. When I am walking on the street and I see a group of people talking with each other I want to dig a hole on the ground and hide myself until they pass. that is what I feel I am feeling like I lost my capacity to talk in groups.,Depression

20976,20996,I finally decided to move out and go low contact no contact with my narcissistic mother. However that means I will not be able to see my previous boys as often anymore. I am heartbroken over it. My sweet puppies I spent everyday with them now I do not even know when the next time Ill see them is. Not only that the words that my mom said to me and how she treated me like I am not her daughter and just some random person really hurt me. My mom was very important to me and it hurts to have to do this so I can be better. I have the rest of my family but I do not want to bother them more than I have. I feel even worse now and even more lonely because I do not even have my own mother to turn to or my sweet dogs to cuddle with anymore. I know with how she is she is going to make me the enemy and say that I am the insane one because I admitted to her that I have attempted 3 times. I have forgiven her for so long. I do not think I am even capable of letting her come back into my life ever again unless she really straightens up. My ma,Depression

26493,26513,Soo I grew up in a pretty unhealthy household. My dad was abusive put cameras everywhere and yelled hit holes in wallsdoors even had to go to ER a few times because glass got into his skin and he was bleeding severely. My mom was suicidal tried to commit suicide multiple times and did nothing anymore I helped her through emotional support and I took over all tasks at home including taking care of my lil brother and my mom. She kicked me out and I had to live with my grandparents where we regularly had to escape the house because my grandpa got agressive. I also got bullied a lot at school people pulled my hair bumped me into walls and just called me names. My brother also threatens me a lot and sometimes we have pretty bad physical fights.After all this I found my first bf we have been together for almost 6 months now. But 1 thing I cannot wrap my head around is that he did not get angry with me once. I actually want him to get angry at me. I want him to scream and yell at me I want him to threaten me. I do not know why but it feels familiar to me. I know it is not healthy but I cannot be the only one who feels this way. I want people to get violent with me sometimes. My brother tells me he will send me to the hospital and I tell him calmly to do it. I do not know why but violence is nothing big to me anymore. And I want my bf to get angry at me but he does not and this gets me pretty frustrated sometimes. My bf does not get angry at me tw violence,Depression
17225,17245,I turned 21 in April and I have attended college on and off. I have struggled with depression since I was 13 and it feels impossible to overcome. I so badly want to pursue a career in acting but I fear the failure. My parents become more and more weary of my future everyday and it shows. My mom said to me today This whole acting idea you have been so fixated on the past years seems to just be part of you mental illness and that hurt me a lot. I know I am struggling to figure out my life but i cannot be the only one. I lack motivation everyday to do things. Even making a phone call to find a new therapist seems draining. I have nobody to go to to find comfort or support so I am on here hoping that somebody can give me words of wisdom or support. I never thought id seek out assurance from random people on the internet but in a time of utter desperation here i am. How do I overcome my fear and kick this lack of motivation out for good? 21 Years Old and No Direction in Life,Depression
20264,20284,I do not know why I am here I feel like I am not doing anything of substance. I cannot even do anything for myself. My fear and anxiety hold me back from living my life. My depression feeds the cycle. I cannot control my thoughts Please god I just want to die,Depression
24018,24038,Not here for advice just a thought that I am continuing to struggle with. Trigger Warning If its too much for some people please do not read on. Anyone does not get scared of death? Death does not scared me one bit. I find it silly when people are scared of death. I want to die if I get my way but I know I cannot because I know my family would be devastated and they are the reason I have to stay alive. Its a struggle for me every day to live when I really believe that death is freedom. Death free you from the burden of life. You wake up work sleep eat and you do it again the next day. Time passes by and you will be old and on your death bed. I had existential crisis in my early 20s to mid 20s. Asking myself those questions likewhat is the purpose in life? I still do not have the answers for it and I know I will never know. So combining the not fear of death with no purpose in life I feel death is liberating. I am an intuitive person so I feel everything and everyone. I feel their struggles and desires. Death to me means free from nasty people free from the struggles of mundane tasks free from financial struggles and free from responsibility in daily life. The physical pain of death scared me more than death itself. The knowledge that my family will be devastated scared me than death. You know when people say I beat death so I survived and I am a stronger person after I beat death. I do not even relate to that. Its always bedazzled me when people find that surviving death makes you strong. I am constantly struggling with seeing how being alive benefits me. Here are the list of things people would normally give Experience in LoveMarriage most marriages do not last and even if they do there are problems with cheating or something else that comes with it. Career I do not care what title you have you are working to live and to survive in this world not really enjoying itHobbies people are always struggles with finding time to actually enjoy their hobbies.Open to hear other thoughts but I am really just venting my frustration with living when death sounds more free to me When death does not scared you its difficult to live when life is a constant chore to live,Depression
12731,12751,I am use to sad and depressed but literal indifference literal muting of any strong emotion. I feel like this pill has made it easier to want to end it.Not that I am going to act on it because that would be the end which while tempting I have to remind myself that I can try a different medication.I thought about therapy but what would that accomplish? Accept that you had a shiy childhood done now can we move on I have already dealt with the abuse I suffered. My depression does not have trigger's it is always here in the background.The abuse is not the problem the problem is the chemicals in my head. Tried pot and I felt like I went for a ride to the sunken place. Tried alcohol and no buzz just tiredness. I do not even want to know what anything more serious would do.I just want to have moments of happiness I just want the cloud to go away. I am falling into old bad habits such as trying to establish unhealthy relationships because atleast if I make someone else happy I might feel like I am of use. Logically I know I am of use and have argued with my emotions to no ends. Logically I know I am setting myself up for pain when I realize that the connection with others is less than shallow. I feel so indifferent emotionally speaking that I had to stop myself from trying to engage in sex not because I would enjoy it 1. because I have not in the past and 2. because the thing will not get hard. but because in those few minutes when the woman is feeling good I might be able to steal a little satisfaction in my work.I do not expect sympathy I am not cutting or planning not that I would need to I am pretty sure I could do it with the pills I have now. Not that I will because depression is not done with me yet and I am not ready to give up on escaping through medication and eventual life improvement. Thanks for letting me vent these thoughts at a time when I do not feel like I have anyone who I can say this too. Well time to get up and embrace the indifference because honestly it is pretty useful at getting me through work and helping me keep these new bursts of agitation from getting out. Got on Wellbutrin and well this sucks,Depression
18476,18496,I feel like so much is just piling on. My already existing depression has been so bad for the past year. I stopped cleaning showeringbrushing regularly. Slowly but surely. I am ashamed and embarrassed. I am extremely broke and owe 3 months of rent that I do not have.I am anxious most days and have no energy or motivation because I just feel so low. Then tonight while I was in bed I saw what was either a rat or a mouse. I have never seen one mouse in the summertime usually fallwinter but apparently they can about when its hot too. I am so scared. I am worried about being bitten. I feel gross and I really just want to sleep because its 2am but I am too nervous. I am poor and apparently have ratsmice. I am extremely scared of getting sick. From anything. Least I WAS semi safe at home. Life is shit right now. I honestly just want to disappear. Thanks. saw either a rat or mouse and want to die,Depression

8129,8149,I am so fucking tired of feeling like this. A deep sadness deep into my bones. Exhausted,Depression
11665,11685,I am starting to feel like I am not the type of person who should be in a relationship. Romantic friendly any relationship. I am too pathetic. I always pounce at the opportunity to open up about my problems to people I think I really crave someone who will always be there for me. But it always just ends up making things awkward and burdensome for others. I have no purpose in life. Maybe I should find a hobby or something. But even then. Hobbies would just help me get by day to day. In the grand scheme of things I have no real purpose in life. I feel like I am just living waiting to die. I am not extremely passionate towards anything. Ironically the only thing I really value is maybe my relationships with people but I cannot hold even those together. So I just exist.

13362,13382,He does not want to tell his family me and my girlfriend are the only two people to know this. All ways to help we could muster were to just keep in touch with him and try to cheer him up. But I feel like that is not enough like more can be done to help him. He tried to take his life in the past but his school therapist did not prescribe him any meds which makes me worried even more since he is liable to try again. So I ask again how do I help him? My friend is struggling with depression. How do I help him?,Depression

12785,12805,I have been alone for a while and In my past relationships I was manipulated and treated like shit and I just took it because I was afraid to be alone again after the 2nd time she cheated I finally just decided being alone was better off than whatever the relationship was I am so used to being by myself and feeling alone even when I am surrounded by people. My suicidal thoughts are all that run through my head its tiring pretending like everythings ok I have told my parents about it in the past and went to therapy and the doctors for help it helped for a while but then it did not it was just getting annoying going to see them that I just told everyone that I am fine but I am not. I recently found some one who makes me happy just being around her but everytime we stop hanging out my thoughts just take right back over and tell me that I am not good enough for her or that I do not deserve to be happy I really like this girl but I am so scared to be hurt again my thoughts are telling me that she feels nothing for me and that its just lust the last time I felt like this she hugged me for hours and kissed me with so much passion that I truly felt that something could happen between us but then I found out she felt nothing at all and she just did it becausein her words yolo so now that this other girl is doing the same thing I am afraid she going to do the same thing the last one did i do not know what to do anymore I just want the pain to stop and lately all I can say to myself is for the pain to stop I should just end my life I am just sick of trying only to be told it was not good enough Should I just give up,Depression

24159,24179,I am promising this because I have experienced it.On Monday I attempted suicide and now I was being serious. Before this attempt I had only self harmed and overdosed in small amounts. On Monday I drank an entire bottle of sleeping pills. I was seriously going to die.While I was still conscious I started feeling regret. For the first time in 2 years I realized that my problems did have a solution and a date. They were eventually going to end but committing suicide was the only mistake I was not able to retract from.I felt regret. I felt treater for all the things I did not do. I felt regret for leaving my loved ones behind. I did not have enough strength to call 911 so I just blacked out praying because I still wanted to live. Miracles happen and me being able to write this is one of them.I did not die. I cannot explain how. I drank 100 pills did not go to the hospital and somehow managed to survive.Today one of my friends called me. She even invited me to a trip.I thought I was alone. I thought no one cared about me. It turned out to be false. People care. I only had to wait 2 days more.If I had died on Monday I would have died believing a lie. I would have died thinking that my life was doomed. I would have just died in vain.Please stay strong and know that fighting is worth it. Things get better I promise. They got better for me. They can get better for you too.,Depression

It feels like nobody cares that I'm struggling and I'm sure by the end of the week I won't even have a phone to use for applying to other places and even if I do how will they call me for interviews?Honestly if it wasn't for my grandparents I would just kill myself because I'm just sick of life and people I'm just happy that they aren't aware of my problems because I don't want to stress them out.,Depression

I look at all these people that are happy and enjoying things and I find it pitiful that I cannot do that. I Constantly tell myself that I am worthless that nobody should waste their time with me.

27078,27098,Holidays have been stressful for me even since I was a child. I have terrible anxiety socializing with anyone even family. But a few years ago my parents got divorced which made things even worse for me. I now have to split my time between every holiday even minor ones like 4th of July. This one was supposed to be easy but my parents changed plans last minute of course and I am now so stressed and depressed that is its almost 3pm and I have yet to even get out of bed because the stress is making me depressed and being depressed is crushing every shred of motivation I have. I just wish for once my feelings would be considered even for a minute. Both of my parents are aware that I have severe mental health issues yet they continue to act like they do not see an issue. I just want to be heard for once. Holidays make me feel terrible,Depression

14582,14602,I am 27 years old and have grown deeper into a depression since I was about 2425. When the going gets tough my mind goes to suicide more quickly. I have this odd obsession with death even outside of suicide no I have never had the urge to hurt anyone. Its more of a pondering. I am just going to go on a rant. Maybe you will have advice support or inspiration. Ill take it. Surfacing complex family issues are unraveling forcing me to confront my perfect childhood as a facade. My mom needs counseling and will not help herself. She hates me possibly because I was a daddys girl and my dad was lying cheating and manipulating her for most of their marriage. They stayed together for the kids until I was 17. Despite this I have always seen my father as more of the logical stable and supportive parent. Now I wonder if he actually loved me or if that was a facade too psychopathic even? It seems melodramatic typing that out but as my dad gets older and his political views 180 I wonder if I even know the real person behind my father. My mother cannot see me as anything other than an unruly irresponsible teenager even though I have supported myself financially 100 since I was 18 and been employed since I was 15. she is toxic and constantly negative. I keep falling for her tricks of inviting me to housesit for her abroad she built this house with child support money that I have never seen a dollar of. then when I arrive after a 500 flight and getting permission from my work to stay employed remotely she flips the script she stays for 2.5 weeks makes me pay her bills while I am here tells me to bring a friend and then talks shit about them the whole time to me and me to them. She shames my body and my sexuality making me feel worthless. I am flexible to accommodate for her change in plans and then she flips whenever thinking she is doing ME a favor for letting me stay in her beautiful Costa Rican house. The last time I tried to tell her how I felt about our relationship she said I needed to seek help with that. Which yes I clearly do need lots of therapy and counseling. But our relationship will not heal unless she gets help too. I am thinking about cutting her out of my life completely. Then there is the constant existential dread I have about not finding my purpose. I have a useless degree in photography and keep taking these dead end jobs just above minimum wage despite knowing I am intelligent creative with a strong work ethic if I am being challenged and care. I get rejected from the more esteemed jobs I apply to due to lack of experience. Everyone says I am so passionate and talented with photography but I have grown to hate it. The selfie culture of social media and bragging seems so fake and morose to me. I have decent photos but have grown to hate my own work and question whether I really have any talent at all preventing me from pursuing it more. My insecurities are building all the time. Its difficult for me to find peace with my face body personality whole self despite being toldIm attractive sexy funny and kind. I think my personality has become boring and empty in the last 3 years. It feels like there is a large black hole in my throat that is eating me alive from the insideout. I find small talk unbearable and anxiety inducing. In a oneonone situation I am good at connecting with most people. In a group setting I feel awkward alone uncomfortable and empty. I used to love going out to concerts to shoot the band dance and socialize. I felt so in my element. Now even dancing feels forced and I watch everyone having fun feeling joy and I feel lost. I am currently in an open relationship with my boyfriend who loves me dearly and I him. Sometimes however it feels like I am settling because of lack of attraction and a deeper connection. We can go deep kind of and I feel as if out of anyone I can talk to him the most. But always I am still guarded of my deeper selfthe one that constantly thinks of suicide or my worthlessness. I think there is someone out there who is more of an intellect world traveled experienced and attractive to me. Someone big and strong that can hold me and inspire me. I feel guilty for even having these thoughts and wonder if I truly love him or if he fills the void of my loud mind and loneliness. Maybe I need the open relationship due to my commitment issues. Ormaybe its because hes not the one for me and I think I can possibly find that person on the side. Clearly I need to love myself first before I can really love someone else right? Still this is the most stable romantic relationship I have ever had and I am not ready to end it. And lastly there is the friendships in my life. I was the type of person that got along with all the cliques in high school and bounced around. I am still close with a few of my high school friends. However I feel as if they have all moved on without me even my bestie and I am the worst at staying in touch. Sometimes Ill send bday presents and reach out randomly. When we see each other there is nothing but love. However I live across the country and nobody makes an effort to check in on me. It seems oneway. I lost touch with my college friend groups both of them. They all still go on trips together and I have never been invited. My bestie from college did not invite me to her wedding its small but still and I honestly thought wed be friends for life. I had a big falling out with 2 of the girls in my girl group in the summer of 2020. They were my main links to the crew and essentially I was exiled. I still photoshop of all of them together on social media and I feel alone and forgotten. One of the issues was covid related with varying reactions and living standards during the pandemic. And the other was over a guy my friend met on tinder who was also chatting with me on a fetish website. When I figured out it was the same guy I stopped talking to him and we never met or flirted or anything. Nothing. He texted me randomly saying he did not want to be with my friend and I stayed out of it thinking I was doing the right thing. She said I broke girl code by not telling her. Maybe she is right. But fuck that. Not worth fighting over I am going to. On a current noteyesterday I was enjoying my day off work running on the beach and i stop to say hi to a dog with a collar thinking it was this dudes dog sitting 20 feet away. This dog adopts me. Follows me all day everywhere. I try to bring it back to where it initially started following me but it will not leave my side. At night it came back to my house and I gave her water and food. she slept outside as she is riddled with fleas. Today I tried to post her online in a local forum walked her up the beach and to a vet reached out online spoke to a few people in the street. Nothing. When the vet rejected to take her it broke me. I went back to the beach and started crying. What was I going to do with this pup? I thought about the people that had her tied up and most likely mistreated her so much that she chewed the rope off there was a knot on the collar. I thought about none of the people that wanted to help her. And I compared myself to these people as I was just one of them. I could not bring the dog back to my moms house as she is against strays or rescues and has a cat. I went for a swim and this dog tried to swim out for me but could not make it and eventually gave up. As I treaded water she ran up and down the beach searching for me for about half an hour. I had to swim to a nearby beach to avoid her finding me. I am a bleeding heart for animals and this also broke me. I feel responsible as if I were her original owner abandoning her. I think about how confused she must be and if she tried to swim out again after I left. I have been seriously considering ending my life with alcohol and Xanax pills which I have access to they are my moms. it would be ironic at least. I always play out the scenario in my mind. Thinking about my mom and how she would think I was selfish and weak. Thinking about how I did this to her purposefully as opposed to doing it to end my meaningless and lonely life. To end the suffering. To quiet my mind forever. To make space for others potentially and stop wasting resources. What stops me is knowing that I want to travel and blow my funds before I end it all. I want to see the world and meet people from different cultures. I want to learn new languages get lost in strange cities and towns hike up beautiful mountains see awesome landscapes scuba dive live by a beach and get decent at surfing share laughs and connect with strangers maybe help others even in simple ways. Maybe find someone who seems out of my league that is intelligent and challenges my thoughts and ideas. That wants to travel with me even if In a dirty old van or on motorcycles. If I died people would say she had her whole life ahead of her and they would be right. But I do not think it will get better. Maybe it gets worse. Maybe the noise expands maybe I self destruct my romantic relationship have no friends and get stuck in the deadend jobs forever. Get old and regret not quitting more to live a life of fulfillment. Maybe the black hole in my chest expands and swallows me whole. I wish it would already. The 27 Club Minus the Fame amp Glory,Depression

17438,17458,I work full time I am tired all the time being tired makes me depressed trying to solve my tiredness and sadness I cut back on the hours I am broke being broke makes me upset I take more hours to afford to go to therapy thus starting the cycle over again.... Ugh. I hate my job but I have hated every job I have ever had. I hate working. I hate not working because I am at home with nothing to do and my time is freed up with no friends to spend with. I just do not have anything in my life that makes me passionate. Even my husband is starting to wear on me and he is the love of my life. If it were not for him and my cat I do not think I would have any will to live. I have tried anti depressants and they make me feel like shit and increase the brain fog. I just do not know what to do anymore. The future is an abyss of work eat sleep repeat. This is stupid but today I broke into tears after realizing my coworker says good morning name every day I work with him. it is so stupid but that is the closest thing I have to a friend and it means a lot. I am sorry for just up and ranting but I do not know what to do. I am just sad and tired all the time no matter how much I sleep and I cannot afford therapy.

18019,18039,I have been on sertraline for about a month now. I took 25 mg for the first two weeks and now I am on 50 mg. I have a psychiatrist appt later to maybe update my dosage to 100 mg. I am not on any antipsychotics atm but my psychiatrist has mentioned wanting to put me on olanzapine for quite a while now and I think hes going to bring it up now that the antidepressants ordeal is mostly settled. I am very scared. I have never taken an antipsychotic before. I have done some research myself and I found that it increases the risk of irregular heart rhythm and this is just terrible really because I already suffer from irregular heart rhythm due to anorexia. I would really appreciate it if anyone who has taken this combination can share their experience and maybe provide some reassurance Has anyone here taken olanzapine and sertraline together?,Depression

I am sitting alone in the dark and feel like I am circling the void and it is terrifying because I do not want to do anything bad but I do not know how to talk to them about how I feel without it turning into a fight or abuse of their parenting.

48090,48072,I don't wanna try anymore I'm a 25 year old man who's never had a girlfriend or sex in his life and since yesterday I decided to give up trying. I have a very good life amazing family and friends that understand and support me no matter what I do I have a job that I enjoy and coworkers I get extremely well along with. I don't consider myself ugly I think I'm just mid. I nurture many passions am very extroverted and outgoing and I believe I'm quite smart but especially in these last 3 years I've been feeling extremely hollow and sad and the reason why is no matter what I do or how much I keep improving myself I seem to have no luck with girls. Yesterday I went out with this great girl I met in university 2 years ago which I've been texting on and off with. I thought she had interests in me since she was the one asking me out but as I later found out in the day she had been seeing this guy for about a month where she is studying. I promised myself to go into that date with no expectations but of course there was hope things would go well. However as per usual I had to go back home and cry myself to sleep for the 100th time and I'm just tired of this endless repeating cycle.People who've had at least one relationship in their life will never get the pain.,Depression

47340,47325,I'm not sure what to do anymore I feel like everything is coming to an end around me. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside out and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel scared and alone I'm terrified those around me will abandon me or forget about me but I'm too scared to reach out to them. my parents have been trying to contact me for days but I can't stomach the thought of talking to anyone right now but I don't want them to worry about me. I just don't really know what to do right now.,Depression
20088,20108,Therapy medication exercise.therapy medication exercise. I have spent half of my life in this vicious cycle nothing seems to be a permanent solution to my misery. I know I should not feel this way. I am young 20s objectively successful subjectively attractive likeable enough. I have friends who care about me a partner who says he loves me. I managed to climb out of the traumatic hole I was raised in and creat what most would consider a wonderful little life for myself. So why cannot my brain chemistry just get with the program? What are you suppose to do when nothing feels like its working anymore. I really do not see the point in doing this for another 70 some odd years. The pain is astronomical. I find myself bawling uncontrollably as soon as I have a moment alone with my thoughts. Once the crying finally stops the numbness sets in. Sure people would miss me but we all move on. Everyone would move on. I am really just struggling to keep going. What makes the cycle worth it for you? Is there really a light at the end of the tunnel? When nothing works anymore,Depression

22609,22629,So basically I started cutting my wrists and some of my friends found out. They told me to stop so I said I did it was a complete lie. I thought they had believed me. But they did not because somehow the school counselor found out. At some point people started fucking with me because for like 2 weeks straight he was calling me to his office every other day because someone kept saying I was still cutting myself which I was not. In one of the meetings he told me that I have obviously become someone people need to worry about and that shit hit deep. I cried about it later because that made me feel so bad. It is not even the worst thing I have had said to me but it hurt so bad for some reason. I think its because I never wanted to be the person people had to worry about. He also told my parents that they should consider putting me in a mental institution... like wtf? Things have just gone downhill from there though. COVID happened I became overweight Which would not be a bad thing if my parents were so harsh about it. In one instance My mom made me try on shirts she knew would not fit me anymore and when they were tight she told me it made her feel better. I have been lonely I lost one of my best friends because he thought I liked him as more than a friend and accused me of things now he responds to my texts hours later with K or cool. I am sad and people tell me I only act sad for attention even though I try my best to hide it. Well you have obviously become someone people.need to worry about.,Depression

9174,9194,It never gets better. Day in day out the same thoughts surround my headI cannot be alone my thoughts hate me.I spend my time doing nothing but wishing to vanish from existence.Even as I child I never wanted to be here. I am not meant for this.I should not be here.I do not belong.People change and grow distant.I cannot save myself how can they?Too much a coward to end things.I suffer the pain of existence. They all can see it they cannot help it. It never gets better.I am ready to leave.It never gets better. It never gets better,Depression
8246,8266,It would just be nice to share perspective or see how other people help support their loved ones when things get tough or said loved ones are having bad episodes. But I also understand that hearing about said perspective and experience with living with depressed persons might come off as triggering to anyone who is depressed if I were depressed I would hate to see how my depression has affected others around me. it is an inevitable thing that happens and it is a complicated issue. But something that I think is not talked about much in my experience.it is a hard pill to swallow but being a part of a depressed persons support group can be really traumatizing when things get bad more so if you live with them. Like I have had to talk them down from suicide bring them out of their intrusive suicidal ideation induced by substance abuse cleaned up their blood after self harming occured having to see them in a psych ward being afraid of triggering an episode being afraid of walking in on a dead body in your own home. And that is not accounting for being there for another relative who was in the hospital after an attempt or having a best friend who is also medically depressed. It is all around me.TW VENT AHEADAnd no matter what despite all of that. you are always supposed to push down whatever feelings of anger and frustration or sadness you might have in favor of taking caresupporting the person that needs the most help at the moment. And feelings of resentment happen but I personally do not want to feel that way I feel that letting those negative emotions take over helps no one much less the person you want to help. But it is so hard sometimes and it is hard to talk about without sounding emotionally selfish to some capacity because you have a whole medically depressed person right there! so you automatically feel guilty for even taking your feelings in consideration. Like how dare you be negatively affected my someone else's depression fuck you! their well being and mental health is important than yours at the moment! Suck it up! and I know that sounds like an exaggeration but it is the reality of things. Like whatever I am feeling needs to take a back seat because I need to reserve my emotional energy for when another depressive episode from one of my relatives rolls around. And yes this person has a psyche a therapist and meds. If they did not have those things they would have definitely been gone by now but it still seems like it is going to be a while until they are able to manage their depression. it is just really hard and I feel so alone in these types of feelings I am having these feelings that i feel like I cannot afford to have. But that is not realistic and these feelings are there and they are eating away at me it makes me want to run away from it all. But again it can always be written off by a statement like this well whatever you are feeling I can guarantee you the depressed person is having a worse time than you right now and...they would be right!....and I go back to feeling like shit and the cycle continues. But I feel so written off constantly because I am in such constant and close proximity to depression i feel like I am not allowed to be cared about or acknowledge whatever it is I am going through or feeling. I just do not know if anyone feels this way. VENT OVERThat said I think a therapist would be the best answer to my plight but I do not have access to one no healthcare I am the process of having that be sorted out. And I know you can only do so much as a support you are not supposed to shoulder to much of a depressed persons burden but it is different when you live with them you see the depression and you experience their episodes from the outside except you are not exactly a bystander either and you got to get your hands dirty. So that is why i wanted to know if there is any collective of people who has experienced any situation similar. I do not know where else to ask this but is there a support group for relatives living with depressed persons? or a support group for the support group of a depressed individual? it is a unique experience and I would like to speak with others who have experience living with medically depressed persons.,Depression
19634,19654,Hello everyone. I am on a path to do another round of interviews for a higher level position at my work. This should have me excited but all I am feeling is depressed. Is this normal or does anyone else relate to something like this happening to them? Positive change in my life has me depressed,Depression
26682,26702,I feel like I have made a similar post like thisprobably titled the same thing too. But I just wanted to say that I am tired. It seems like such a simple thing and I am not one to be cheesy about my sadness so I am not going to do one of those soliloquy type things. But I am tired. Lately I have been sleep a lot I have got my period today and I am just not interested in much. I blocked my friends one day and i did not even have the energy to add them back. Even worse I did not miss them I have been reflecting on myself and why I am the way I am and why people in my personal life dislike like me or are deterred by me and I think its because my own behaviour. Perhaps I am disgusting. Maybe I am weird. To go off topic here I think I am a pathological liar and I need to get help. Again this is completely unrelated but its just the fact that I know there is something wrong with me I just do not know for sure what it is. Even seeking help from a professional puts me nowhere because ultimately its just an inference. Psychology is nothing like being a doctor and performing surgery. Yes being a doctor is based around making an educated guesses but in the end there is always a right answer. One that is more commonly or usually found out as opposed to cases where they are not. Reflection.,Depression
13465,13485,The reason I want to talk about this is because I am a completely different person without depression than with depression. The way I think and how I see myself is totally modified. I know this because I experience depression in episodes which means that on some random day I wake up and just feel normalneutralhappy no depression. I get a lot of blame by others for not focusing on the positive or for being mentally weak during a depressive episode while in truth those symptoms are all things that are directly linked to depression and it is almost impossible to remove them without removing the depression.The symptoms GUILT. I would literally feel guilty for my whole existence and everything I do or am. I become the culprit the scapegoat the inherently wrong one... I would have this feeling all day long. Whenever I am NOT depressed this feeling is completely absent. LOW SELFESTEEM. Oh yes that is a big one and a very obvious one. I would also not feel entitled to do certain things because I feel like I do not deserve it. I deserve to be treated badly by others and not allowed to speak up for myself etc. It is also almost entirely absent without depression. COMPLAINING AND OVERTHINKING. I often forget that this is also directly linked to my depression. I do not really have much of a reason to overthink about things in my life and then constantly complain about stuff which I do 247 while depressed. I am not able to deal with and overcome the problems I have during those episodes whereas during nodepression I have the tools the emotional strength and the solutions to get out of difficult situations. I encourage you to add more symptoms you experience to this list. Can we talk about the less obvious symptoms of depression?,Depression

24264,24284,Most days I feel nothing. I am either totally empty inside or I am frustrated. Today I feel sad genuinely sad. I just feel so much guilt for so much that is gone wrong in my life. Why do not I talk to my mom more? Why do not I acknowledge my own feelings? Why was I so mean to so many people? Am I doomed to forever miss subtext and accidentally insult someone or come off as annoying? The answer to that last one is probably yes. I think I am autistic at this point and it just never gets better.Is this a good sign? Is this a sign that I am ready to confront the things in my life that I am not ok with? Will I eventually be happy if I keep going down this road? Or is this a sign that I am getting worse? I feel sad instead of feeling nothing is this progress?,Depression
20186,20206,I cannot believe my mindbrain has become as sick as it now is. I have been fighting and trying and now I am afraid that I am not going to make it. I am posting this here because it is not my last ditch effort. I am tired of wearing my friends down. As soon as I take what feels like a victorious 5 steps forward I take 10 back. I have all the insight in the world as to what is going on with my brain what thoughts I should ignore blah blah blah I do not say that to minimize their importance but it really is to the point that I do not care if I die in my sleep. It feels like there is something inherently wrong with my entire profile as a person and I am only 32 and feel like I have lived for 80 years. I think my reserves are tapped and even when I see a light at the end of the tunnel it gets eclipsed. I cannot even be scared for myself anymore. I do not even want to ask for help anymore. I would not wish this on anyone. Been asking for help...and I am losing if not lost hope,Depression
22847,22867,Because every positive thought is fleeting. Sadness and resentment are forever. They fill me like a sinking ship as I dwell in them. People keep telling me to act before I think. To just do. And I think its stupid advice. Its stupid to assume that just by forcing myself to get up and do the things I have dedicated myself to doing is going to change anything. I spend hours practicing guitar and I hardly get anywhere. I learn a song and practice it for weeks only to discover I am still to anxious to play in front of my closest friends. I still do not have the muscle memory that I keep plucking painfully at the guitar to get. If I were to do instead of think I would be dead. I would have killed myself because that is what I want to do half the time. I hate it when people give me this advice because for those neurotypicals they do not understand the horrible things that go through my mind constantly and all the horrible things I would have done if I just did things without thinking. For guitar it might be a little different but I am horrified of embarassing myself which only makes me beat myself up more when I inevitably fail due to the ironic paradox of my selffulfilling prophesy.

48201,48181,Mmm just some thoughts if you can relate congrats I dont feel loved. I dont feel like I have any support. I dont feel like I can go to anyone and I can tell them exactly how I am feeling because theyre gonna quote some bullshit Bible verse or tell me Im being so dramatic. My mom doesnt like listening to me talk but little does she know she needs to cherish my ramblings cause one day Im gonna just jump in front of the G train and shes gonna wish she listened to me cause it would be her last day hearing my voice. I want to spend the rest of my life doing something Im passionate about that I simply dont care if Im gonna make any money at all. I want to feel something so bad but I feel nothing. I have no real goals no real accomplishments no real aspirations.And Im trying so hard to see the brighter side. Im trying so hard to be positive. Im trying so hard to find the balance but its not working. Its times like this when Im sitting in silence where there are no sounds and I dont have my headphones to drown out all these negative thoughts. I have to sit with them in silence suffering.I want friends and I want to build meaningful relationships with people but people are just so tiring I hated having friends but brushed it off as maybe I wasnt friends with the right people. They were so overwhelming I just wanted to be quiet all the time. I dont know. I dont know whether I want to die or if I want to live. If I live my life it wont be mine and if I die supposedly my life wont be mine either according to some book of stories.,Depression

10740,10760,Not sure it will probably pass but I have been dealing with depression for years went through periods of medicating but I have been off medication for 56 years now. I know they are all kind of different but I tried a few and it was not really for me not saying I will not try again I have gone from someone who does not showerlook after themselves in any way to someone who is in their 3rd year of uni and nearly has a skincare routine nearly. I know it is good but I feel like no matter how much water I drink how well I do in class how often I brush my teeth I cannot help crashing and burning every couple of weeks with everything turning to absolute shit. All it takes is a tiny thing and I feel fucked I do not want to do anything. I feel like the universe is against me like I am really trying soo hard and things are going wrong that are just stupid. Like random shit I feel like for every step up I take life's trying to push me back down and I just feel really tired and like what is the point. I know the point is to keep going and better myself and learn to manage my emotions better and all that go back to therapy consider medication but I really just feel like shit and that it is not going to change anything sometimes. Has anyone struggled much with diagnosis? I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression in my teens I am 24 now female and I was kind of wondering almost hoping that my diagnosis was wrong so I could start on a path that would actually get me somewhere. Maybe it is just like a pipe dream but has anyone here tried to deal with their depression for years before finding out it was something else? Or a combination? Autism ADHD OCD PTSD I just want to be the best I can be and fit in and contribute but then I do not want to get out of bed at all. I hit the side of my head on the bathroom basin this morning accidentally it was so stupid do not ask and I cried for like half an hour because it reminded me of when my ex would hit me stupid I know it is just a basin with no feelings or maliciousness and now I do not want to do anything but cry hahaha I keep losing my keys! I have a spot for them now but it is just a little thing and I just feel absolutely incompetent and useless hahah I keep setting up these little contingencies to help me accomplish things and keep my shit together but its not working very well idk hahaha rant over sorry I have been doing good on paper but I feel like the more I try the more shit goes wrong. I know it is probably my perception but I am trying so hard and I know I am being a better person but everything is just getting worse.,Depression

47106,47094,I dont want to care about being alone Im 40M and Ive always maintained that Im too ugly for women and that hasnt changed. Then my not long ago my therapist talked me into using a dating app to get experience to chatting with women and to get over fears of rejection.I didnt like the idea but I did it anyway. Well I think it is fair to say that it was the final straw because the only women who were allegedly interested were women in foreign countries sure they were highly educated they claimed and quite a few of them were not bad looking but I zero matches from us women.Long story short I was talking to this female doctor in the Dominican Republic and most of our conversations had to be done with google translate because she didnt speak much English. Well after a while I realized that this was going nowhere and I politely told her that we needed to go our separate ways and unmatched her.A few days later I decided that enough was enough I think its beyond reasonable doubt that Im too ugly and need to just embrace being alone for life. But my brain wont let me I keep having to remind myself to not go back to the app to just find ways to help people and be content alone but again my mind keeps obsessing about being alone so that I find myself needing to vent several times a day and its pathetic.I have proof that Im hopelessly ugly among other things and need to just stop thinking about it and embrace being alone and stop caring. I dont want to care anymore I want to happy and content with my life.,Depression

They said What is this he is saying A little while? We do not know what hes talking about. Jesus knew they wanted to ask him and so he said to them Are you asking one another about what I said A little while and you will not see me again a little while and you will see me? Truly I tell you you will weep and mourn but the world will rejoice. You will become sorrowful but your sorrow will turn to joy. When a woman is in labor she has pain because her time has come. But when she has given birth to a child she no longer remembers the suffering because of the joy that a person has been born into the world. So you also have sorrowfn now. But I will see you again. Your hearts will rejoice and no one will take away your joy from you. In that day you will not ask me anything. Truly I tell you anything you ask the Father in my name he will give you. Until now you have asked for nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive so that your joy may be complete. Sorrow Turned to Joy,Depression

47651,47635,My feelings arent making sense anymore TLDR at bottom Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for a good 10 years now with the worst dip taking place a year back. Im slowly starting to get better but lately something weird has started happening. The worst part of depression for me is the sadness that I cant seem to shake. Its not the normal kind of sadness rather the romanticheartbroken sadness. Ive not been in a relationship for a long time and Im not well enough to be in a relationship at the time. I still talk to girls like I used to but in a much more restricted way.One person recently wrote to me and we started talking nothing intense or anything.When that person doesnt answer or say something I could interpret as something negative through mental parkourMy heart breaks I get the biggest pit in my stomach and I get completely engulfed in the sorrow. This happened the very first day of us talking. I am not in love with this person we dont really know eachother nothing has happened i dont even know if what were doing has any romantic side to it at all.Most of the time I can understand why I feel the way I do even if its mostly negative. But this anxietyridden pit in my stomach wont go away and I cant reason with it.So I guess the TLDR I become unreasonably romantically attatched after just a few words over text which leads me to feel constantly heartbroken. Am I just lonely and I havnt realized it?,Depression
21914,21934,My whole life I feel like I have been going through the struggle. My dad is an abusive and toxic parent that put me through so much as a kid into early adulthood. I worshipped him until I was 20 and a light bulb went off in my head and I realized all the bullshit he put me through. I have separated from that relationship but still feel the effects of it. I have been heavily depressed the last few years. My mom died 2 years ago and I worked a low paying depressing job for a long time. This year I really wanted to get out of the rut I was in and I got a new better paying job and am starting to make friends for the first time since freshman year of high school. For a moment there it seemed like things were finally starting to look up but in a very short period of time work became a lot more tense some drama has members of my family hating me thankfully only the toxic members as the cool ones know what is up but it is still really getting to me. I got a kitten to help with my mental health but it died after a few weeks. My roommate is moving out at the end of our lease despite originally agreeing to stay another year and I am worried I cannot afford to live on my own yet. there is a girl I like but she does not like me. I am getting hit with insane medical bills. I know this sounds like typical stuff people have to deal with but it is happening all at once and I cannot remember the last time I was happy for any significant amount of time. I feel so alone and lost and I feel like I have just kept going through hell over and over again my entire life. Will it ever get better? Will I ever not be alone? Is happiness even possible? I do not know what to do,Depression
17526,17546,Empty nights. Hollow mornings. I lean up from my cushion throne. My eyes encrusted with the jewels of insomnia. A crown of shaggy hair sits sullenly on tired thoughts. Thoughts I searched for air. Hazily my legs take a stand. I lean for balance my body clashing against the sheer will of wanting to stay in yesterday. My hesitation to leave my bejewelled cuffs is met with ironclad stares from the window blinds. I can see the glacial air that permeates from the tiles in front. Its a pearly snow fog no higher than the bottle in my future. Slowly I topple backward stumbling on my unthought words and missed calls. I am back to square one. Living by the hour. And now I am the hell I tried to escape. Mind dump,Depression
47526,47510,I'm too old and pretty much done I'm 24 I will be 25 in November and I haven't done anything with my life.I'm still at University because I reproved 3 years and I still got 3 more years hopefully to finish it. I have no friends much less a girlfriend I used to hang out with my school friends till about 2019 but nowadays all of them have moved on with their lives at University I made no friends the first 2 years and now is impossible because everyone already knows each other so there is no get to know each other moments. Not only that but because I fucked up so many times at University I lost access to the government grants and I must pay for University with my money which I don't even have because I don't have a job but even if I had one it wouldn't be enough.I don't do anything the whole day nor do I talk with anyone I haven't had a conversation with someone other than my family for about 3 years. I'm only eating once a day because I'm short on money I hate going outside because I don't have anything to do but I can't even watch a movie or play a video game because is just not fun anymore I often just keep opening and closing the movies or games.Now that I'm 24 I just feel way too old to do most things and feel like I don't fit anywhere. I'm not good looking and people just ignore me I feel like I just missed the boat on developing social relationships and It's too late for me now.,Depression
19694,19714,I am sad again as always. Constantly being reminded about how I will never mean anything to anyone. I attach to too many people so easily. do not know if its because of me being an empath or if I am just desperate for love and attention. I want love. I really do. But at the same time I do not I do not want love. It terrifies me. I do not trust another soul to love me back the same way I love them. To care about me the way I do. It will always be me who gives more. No one can ever love me. I am not worthy of it. Ill never be enough. Not pretty. Not smart. Not skinny. Nothing. there is nothing to love about me. I do not even love myself. I do not even love myself.,Depression
10669,10689,so I recently failed out of my graduate diploma program that was supposed to help accelerate my career as a CPA.I feel so defeated knowing I put everything I had into this program but just falling short. I feel like I let myself down along with everyone around me who continues to support me some know and some I cannot bring up the courage to tell Bc I am so embarrassed.I have the option to go it on my own now and do the course online myself while working full time I am scared I am not going to be enough again and scared to fail again.Does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement on how failing helped them in the future or share a similar experience and how you turned it around? failing,Depression
47443,47428,I don't feel great I'm 14 and I just wanna die. I have a therapist and shes nice and all but shes doing nothing. I still wanna die. None of my friends ever wanna hang out with me and it makes me feel worse. I've been trying to act more happier if that's the problem but I don't think that's working. I'm just so tired of everything. My dream is to explore the outside and abandoned places but even if I could get out of my bed my parents would never let me get past the front door. Recently two guys at my school said I was fine and I thought that was nice but then my friend told me they were trying use me for my body. It disgusted me. I'm 14. I feel unsafe at school and at home. I know my family loves me but I feel unsafe sometimes. My parents say I dont have depression when I've literally overdoesed on meds just to sleep. They say I have too many problems. Not my fault you probably smoked while you were preg mom. I hate saying all this but its the internet and you dont know who i am. Anyways I wanna kill myself and I dunno what to do .,Depression
38420,38417,why is sleeping alot so horrible for depression because of depression i sleep alot but on rare occasion with drug abuse which cause insomnia i am le depressed then i sleep again 0 hour hour and i just feel horrible and suicidal,Depression
19346,19366,School scares me a lot. Certain parts and apps on my phone scares me too. I also get weird chest tightening unease whenever I go near any platforms wherein there is people be it gatherings or just social media.I have also been neglecting my school because of it. I want to try and fix my life take baby steps gradually. But I just cannot. The unease I get is so overwhelming that I just fail to function everytime.Online schooling made it worse. Two things I hate most in one. We use facebook for schooling. And I just cannot deal with it properly. I tried telling myself that this will all pass and I just have to endure for now a little bit but I have endured so many things already that I am scared to experience it again.I am scared and I do not know where this feelings rooted from. Why is it that others get to do things with ease which most would deem as 'normal'. While I am here scared to even look at it. So I escaped everything. But that is never enough because there is always that little gnawing reminder of all the things I set aside in the corners of my brain. No actually it is like the elephant in the room that I never want to address.I told my mom and sister about it. Well I did not tell them willingly they read my diaries full of my depressive ramblings. So they confronted me about it. Confronted. It was last year but I still remember everything they told me. In that diary they found out I was suicidal and how my mom dealt with it was by telling me how expensive coffins would be and that I am inconsiderate for even thinking about killing myself and that I should just forget about my 'traumas' because apparently it is that easy. In that diary they also found out about my molestors and one of them was my own cousin. My sister said that I should just forgive him that he is still a family and I should just try to be more friendly with him because she reasoned he is probably changed now. Not to mention she also invalidated my grief by telling me that I am even more depressed than you. and I hate how she said it a tone which I guess was supposed to console me.I told them I want to get therapy. My mom said that if I do I will be taken to mental hospitals where people will experiment on me to make me even crazier. Sorry I know it sounds ridiculous but she really said that. she is one of those people who believe that Bill Gates is out to control everyone through microchips in covid vaccines. My sister though she agreed that I should be taken to therapy not the one I was expecting nor was it what I needed. She took me to family gatherings with people that I want to strangle she walked me to parkd invaded all my diaries and forced me to tell all about it in detail. After all that she would ask me if I still have depression. I need to ramble.,Depression
10378,10398,I do not get why good people who have lots of other who love them have to get unlucky and die in a car crash or something. Why cannot I just get unlucky and die in an accident so I can just be gone. No one will remember me it does not matter. Why cannot I just die,Depression
47208,47194,Constantly held back by not feeling worthy of getting better. I've been depressed for a few years now. I don't feel totally lost. Somewhere inside me I still have hope I still have a real belief that it's possible for me to feel normal and happy again. But there's a much stronger feeling an overwhelmingly powerful one that even if I could be happy again I don't deserve it. I don't deserve support from others I don't deserve to make small gains for myself. Every time I start to move in a positive direction every time others give me advice and offer help every time it seems like I'm finally digging myself out of the hole.... I stop myself. I hurt myself. I don't let myself get better because I feel like I don't deserve to be better. I hate it. It feels totally inescapable. No matter what progress or advantage I'm giving I end up deliberately damaging it and tossing it away because I can't escape the feeling that I deserve nothing but suffering that it's an injustice to the world if I get better.Does anyone else feel this way? Is there any way to feel worthy?,Depression
11025,11045,I am writing a story and my character is a man in his late 30s who is had depression since he was in his early teens. Now I have been depressed since my early teens too but I am only 20 and still trying to get my life together. what is it like being depressed when you are older and have more life experience?

23290,23310,I am actually at the end of it all. My partner tells me how much they care for me even though I have just expressed how much I want to take my own life and their response was to fall asleep as I went missing for quite some time.I have been feeling so alone and helpless for the last few years. Everything I have ever put my heart and soul into has confirmed how much of a failure I am I have never succeeded in anything I have tried. Even as I write this I just want to hop into my car and drive it into the nearest lake and end it all.I am leaving all personal stories out of this otherwise I would be typing for probably a few months. But in short I have been mistreated by family and friends all my life I have been bullied for many years and my anxiety means I cannot even perform the simplest task. Please if anyone is able to give me some form of help it will stop me from getting into my car in the next hour and driving it into my local lake. I do not want to live anymore,Depression

16010,16030,Does anyone else feel like they live by counting down the days? How do I get through a lonely weekend? I count down until Monday. How do I get through a bad week? Count until Friday. It started as a coping mechanism for travel anxiety but now I cannot stop counting days until its over. My issue is I am out of things to count to. The weekend is here so what? I have nothing to do expect be alone. Its the work week now but who cares? I hate my 70 hour a week job. I am starting to get scared of myself I have been getting reckless at the end of counts just so I can manufacture something to look forward to drugs large impulsive purchases and I just feel like I am running out of ideas. Counting down the days until the clock is out.,Depression

16444,16464,I found out my boyfriend of two years who was getting ready to move in with me had spent the entire first 7 months of our relationship having a whole other girlfriend simultaneously. He got her pregnant and abandoned her to stay with me instead. When I found all of this out I was devastated and broke up with him. But I cannot help but think of all the reasons I loved him and how hard it is to quit someone cold Turkey that you were so deeply in love with. I have battled depression previously and now feels like the lowest point I have ever had. Any advice would be appreciated. How do you fall out of love with someone that majorly betrayed you?,Depression
40213,40210,i ve just massively overdosed on all of my prescription and it won t be long till i get peace i live by myself so no stopping it now no point complaining about why but i guess this is just a last goodbye it s too late to go back on it i finally feel like i ve made the right choice for the first time in my life it s nice thanks good luck,Depression
15277,15297,I have stopped taking my antidepressants. They made me completely numb and I never felt any emotion at all while I was on them. Since I stopped all the emotions of the past started flooding back and now I do realise why I started taking them in the first place. I am feeling all these negative emotions again and I started to see the world very negatively too. Everything bad that happens to me even if it is out of anybody's control I take it personally. For example when somebody accidentally bumps into me they do it because they hate me and think I am ugly. When I drop a pen or whatever it is because I am useless and I cannot do anything right. Every small thing hurts me way too much. I have been trying to talk to my bf about it. But he struggles mentally too and somehow he always finds a way to turn the tables around and make me comfort him even when I need it the most at that time. I tell him how bad I feel and he apologises for being a bad bf because he could not keep me happy. that is not true at all he is not a bad bf because he could not keep me happy and it hurts me that he thinks so. I have one other friend I do trust enough to tell but I feel like I will be a bother to her. I did tell her a few times and she did listen and even helped me calm down but I do not want to bother her too much. My mom and brother do not understand me at all my brother makes fun of me and my scars and threatens to beat me so badly that I will have to go to the hospital and my mom just does not understand which makes her frustrated and makes her yell at me. I feel like everybody is walking over me. it is a chaos in my mind and I cannot get the peace back. But I also do not want to feel like a robot again. I do not want to go back on antidepressants.This was just a rant I just needed to get it off my chest Feeling lonely and nobody listens,Depression
12620,12640,I am 30 and never been so depressed in my life. it is seriously affecting my way of living and I do not know if I can take it anymore. I tried seeing a therapist a couple years ago but she looked so bored listening to me she was falling asleep.... I never bothered looking again after that. I now have this idea that maybe adults should not see therapists. Maybe I am supposed to know how to deal with my own issues because I am not a kid anymore. I am afraid that therapists are tired of hearing the same shit and see adults as being stupid for not knowing how to solve their own problems. Part of me knows that is not true but part of me also cannot help but think these things. Could some people please enlighten me? what is it like seeing a therapist as an adult?,Depression
14131,14151,I have always been the one people go to when they need to vent or want some advice I do not know why I am not a very open person but apparently people see me as a good listener.I have always taken on the caregiver role as I am hugely empathetic and if I am asked for help I will give it my all. Other peoples feelings prey on my mind more than my own. Over lockdown I realised how much of a shitstorm my mental health has become so many people have had an awful time developing depression because of the world being shut down like it was. Thing is they came to me for consolation but it all weighed down on me so much that I developed severe depression and major generalised anxiety disorder myself. And still I feel guilty when I do not have the energy to give other people the help they need.Does anyone have any advice? How I can be there for others as much as possible without it being a detriment to myself? The truest irony in my life is that I have spent my whole life trying to heal everyone elses mind yet I cannot even look after my own.,Depression
22444,22464,I used to think I would either burn out into a pile of ashes or beat depression to become fiercely successful. I am in a third place instead.I struggle almost every day to get through my normal responsibilities. I struggle to have an optimistic outlook on my future. I struggle to socialize as much as other people not to mention maintain a romantic relationship. I struggle against my addiction to youtube and podcasts my last standing vices to distract me when reality becomes too much. But rather than let those struggles get to me and because me to spiral downward or letting those struggles fuel motivation for me to rise up and persevere through my suffering I do neither. I say that is okay. I wake up every single morning of every single day wishing I were not living the life that I am. that is okayI drown my awareness in free internet content to keep my conscious mind from having to face the totality of my situation. that is okayI contribute to the unsustainable consumption of nonrenewable resources and rampant pollution across the globe that will devastate our species' well being and drive countless more to extinction. that is okayI feel my heart palpitate and strain to keep up with moderate exercise after years of sedentary life. I hear my ears constantly ring at different pitches after years of inexorable overactive stress. that is okayI'm not self destructing I am not crashing out. I am just drifting off. I am sinking into quick sand. I am floating into open ocean. There is no catastrophe there is no drama there is only equanimity and surrender. Equanimity in Surrender,Depression
22135,22155,I just feel like if I had been taken for a psych evaluation when I was a kid Id be able to manage all of my mental illnesses better. I am a danger to others mostly but also myself. I almost feel resentment towards my parents because they saw how I was acting and the things I was doing to other people. It makes me feel bad because I know its not their fault we could not afford it and our insurance did not cover pediatric mental health. I just wish I had that chance to be a better person who could better handle their mental health. I feel like I could have had a chance to be better.,Depression
22296,22316,I do not think I can handle being depressed as fuck one day then just tired the next. Then gold to go another. Then depressed. Then angry energetic. I am telling you this is exhausting. Forgot to do my journal entry for the last 2 days but oh well it was just me studying. Ever since I took responsibility for my depression bipolar whatever it is I have felt freedom. I do not care what the hell is going on anymore. I have a goal I wrote down and I am obsessing over it now. All I see are this goal. I might feel like dogshit while going for this goal but who cares.I made a vow I will hot my targets by this time next year or I am dead. Literally. I think I am bipolar.,Depression

I am having frequent homicidal and suicidal thoughts even though I am on my meds and taking them regularly i cannot think straight either like i said i get stuck thinking too hard to the point where nothing feels real that is when i feel like I have really lost my grip when everything feels fake. i just do not know what to do anymore. people call it an edgy phase because I am young but is it really just a phase? I have suffered from these symptoms for a while so i do not know. is it normal to feel like I am going insane?,Depression

It was a situationship I had with a girl and they all were against me being with this girl because they knew it was not good for me.

10230,10250,I feel like I have been going at this for 6 years now. Day to day I just struggle to feel like this existence is worth the pain and effort. I just wonder if this is all there is? Just this life. Even when I am not bad necessarily the good days are mediocre at best. that is just it anytime I feel 'ok' or 'fine' that is all it is nothing more. Given the choice I would not sacrifice all the bad days for the good ones at all. I just lack the drive and the hope that things will get better that I feel like you need for this life.I have just been thinking very existentially recently which does not help. But I know others are experiencing similar feelings to me so I guess this is me reaching out. Sometimes it just helps to articulate things.

I have not drank alone in a while but I did tonight quite a bit and I am a bit concerned I will go on a binge again.I do not drink during work but I had a week where I constantly drank after work and it started with one night like this.

26095,26115,I do not feel so good I said to my mother she was talking to other people on the party and did not listen. can you please ask someone for some medication? Again no response. I felt terrible and walked around fo a bit. I thought that the pain might just go away with time It did not. I might had been able to ignore it but it got worse. It got so bad to the point where I actually wanted to leave the party. Thanks God I met one of my friends they talked with me and cheered me up. The pain is still there but it is not as strong anymore. And even tho I still want to go I think I am going to stay here for a while.This is something I am actually quiet proud of and I think this is a good reference to depression. This is how depression feels for me.,Depression
14889,14909,Out of all the possible realities we could have been born into we were born into a reality where selfishness violence greed and murder are embedded into surviving in life. The rules are that we have to kill and dismantle other living creatures and consume their molecules to stay alive. does not matter if you are doing the killing or someone else is. It has to be done. This is not about an antimeat or proveganism stance. it is just the hard realization for how things actually are here that cruelty and selfishness is deeply rooted in nature and there is no escaping that.it is amazing that we started out with just water air and sunlight. I often wonder how different life would be if eating was an optional luxury or to prevent social inequalities if eating was poisonous.What point is there to life when most of one's life is spent wanting to exist in alternative worlds?Of course we cannot control how nature works and has decided to be. To stop eating meat and plants would consistently result in a slow and painful death. We do not have any other options here. The cruel reality of Nature itself is depressing,Depression
13833,13853,I am so done. I have to deal with my parents constantly breaking down my confidence that I am trying to work on and being VERY mentally abusive. I get comments about my weight my intelligence my clothing style my actions etc. I cannot even breath without being judged. my parents like to twist the word respect so i get treated like shit but then I have to walk on eggshells when I am around them. it is not like I am a bad kid. I have A'sB's planning for college never get into any trouble yet I am constantly ridiculed like I am the worst kid in the world. Then I have my friends where recently they have been judging me as well for multiple things. They make my parents sound like they are the best and chillest parents ever when they have NO idea what happens behind closed doors. I have ADHD and anxiety and one of the things that I do is that I cannot function if my hands are dry so i carry around lotion with me. EVERY time i would take out the lotion they would give me a weird look. They also like to call me out on a lot of things or call me names just at random and it does not help my already not very mental state. My one friend has called me a 'pig' before on multiple occasions and always has to point out my SH scars and call them 'tic tac toe' like its some sort of joke when all it does is make me want to cut again. I am trying so hard to work on myself and work on my confidence but I feel like I am suffocating. OH also to mention I have found out alcohol causes my spiraling thoughts to temporarily go away so now I am trying not to start an addiction to either SH or Alcohol but I have no one to fucking help me or be there for me without having that feeling of being judged. I also had my girlfriend try to hurt herself and her homophobic parents found out about us so now I have not heard from her for over 2 weeks. I am trying to cope with everything and no one even seems to care. I am just a fucking kid yet I feel like everyone is treating me like I should know how to fix every single problem I have. I want someone to hold my hand and tell me it is going to be okay. I want that embrace of a hug that makes me feel like all my problems have gone away. I want help. I want to be happy like how I was when I was younger. Why did I have to grow up so fast. I am done with constant mental abuse,Depression
27004,27024,I am so tired of hurting and hurting myself can only do so much. My bf might leave me soon so that is fun and now I am in a deep depression and i cannot escape its grasp. Ill never get better or be loved. Breaking with time,Depression
47186,47174,Hopeless and want Hope I do not know where to begin. I found out my mom has stage 2 lung cancer and we have a complicated relationship. I love her but I do not like her as a person. She was very controlling toxic and rough. I know she had the best intentions for me but she used shame to inspire me to be what she wanted. She helped to make me a people pleaser and obsessed with my weight. I do not hate her. I love her. I hate that I am not the daughter she wanted. She is trying to be kind now but it does not come naturally to her.I try to visit my folks every 2 months to help out as I am several states away. I am very sad as when my folks pass they are both in their 80s I will not have any family of origin. I get sad thinking about attending a funeral. It is not sadness. It is deeper. I do not think I would be able to get on a plane. I think about this as my mom has let me know that I have to. I told her that I do not care what other people think. That is a lie. I do care deeply what others think.I am crying right now. It is more than my mom being sick. I grew up being told I was fat and told that everyone was talking about me. I know she just wanted a thin daughter and did not have the tools to tell me she would love me just as I am but was concerned about my health. She would just use guilt and shame to make me feel bad. I think she wanted to inspire me with these tactics. She and my dad both had rough childhoods and did not know how to parent. They sent me to good schools bought me everything I wanted and tried their best with the limited knowledge they had. Still crying and feeling hopeless. I feel that my life has been so much to please them. And I failed according to them. They are both trying very hard to be loving now. I did not receive hugs growing up and do now. I am rambling. I just am very sensitive. I think my self esteem is so low that I do not know how to receive love now. Please tell me if you had a complex relationship with a parent and how you handled end of life issues. How did you cope with a dying parent who made you feel like a failure ?How do you go on after being told how terrible you are?Why was she so rough?Why did it take her finding out she has cancer to hug me and tell me I look good?Why?Will I find happiness after she dies?Why do I hate myself?Why why why and thanks.,Depression
26107,26127,I absolutely despise people that say do not worry things will change it will all be goodBecause it is a lie if you keep with that mentality of things will change I just need to wait for that big change nothing will ever change your life will be the same shithole over and over again and that is insane if you want to do something if you wish for something do not wait for it fight for it do not let anything defeat you because at the end when you are an old man of fucking 80 90 years you will regret everything you will say why I did not do this why I did not learn that if you want something that is achievable fight for it and do not give up if you do your life it is fucked so you want to be a social monster fight for it it might be horrible at first but at the end you will achieve your goals life will not give you something easy if something can go wrong it will so even if your life looks like the worst shit of all things you can change it you just need to fight for it. This was not wrote by me this was from youguillegoky13 Well a friend of mine wrote this for someone in a similar situation as the ones using this subreddit and I think we should share it with some of you,Depression
19543,19563,Hi there! I am new here and I hope this is okay to ask. I 21f struggle with symptoms of depression due to ADHD and anxiety but my boyfriend 23m mainly struggles a lot with depression. Hes been traveling for work for about three months now he visited two weeks ago and seemed very happy to be home. He recently got switched over to another job the company he works for basically sends him and his team to different jobs as they are needed and he hates it. Hes working from 3am3pm and I cannot even imagine how hard that must be. Hes been struggling a lot and I am really trying to support him and stay positive but its really hard sometimes. He barely talks to me. The most I have gotten to talk to him in the last two weeks is for 10 minutes a day. I want to be loving and understanding because I understand how hard this is for him but I am at a crossroad. Mainly because while I get this is very hard for him it is for me too. As someone with anxiety and some trauma from past relationships I have communicated to him that I need at least a little bit of time to check up on him and talk to him. 20 minutes is enough for me. But hes been saying that because hes been depressed he does not ever really feel like talking. I totally get that and I do not want to because him any stress but by doing that I am causing myself and my mental health a lot of pain. I know we can work through this but I would really appreciate some insight or advice on this. Anything will help. Partner with depression,Depression
19531,19551,I hate warmth and going inside so its not going to be fun. does not help that I have the thoughts that people are constantly looking at me judging me and are going to beat me up.

13230,13250,So I grew up as a pretty shy socially anxious child and amid phases of bullying and teasing at school I managed to make a handful of close friends in young mid childhood although at this point still felt very much like an outsider. Then I got to secondary school and made a group of really close friends some of whom I am still close to to this day. After a childhood that was moderately traumatic and full of fear and anxiety for a period of time I felt genuinely connected to my close friends and that I was wanted liked etc. despite moments of teasing bullying in secondary school too. Now I just feel like I have totally lost the ability to make new good close friendships ones where the conversation flows and you feel totally comfortable. Most of the close friendships I have now are from my early secondary school days and even with them I feel like the connection is fading. I feel like I have not made a close friend for years probably 7 or 8 and I am only 21. it is not like I cannot make friends or acquaintances I can for example at university I have people to do things with e.g. get coffee go out for drinks etc. We know each other and in fact we know some stuff about each other that is more than just surface level. They were there for me when I had a mental health crisis earlier this year. But it just does not feel the same. We do not laugh the conversation does not feel natural I do not feel fully known in the way that a deep friendship let us you feel known and loved and accepted and sometimes I will see my school friends after say seeing my uni friends and it will feel so good so natural so easy. Obviously this is maybe expected as I have known my school friends for much longer but I have also known my uni friends for a solid chunk of time and I still feel like we are only acquaintances. And it is so frustrating because my school friends are all making new deep friendships at uni and I feel like I just cannot. it is not like I do not try I do it is just that it never goes any deeper than surface level friendship. And I want to feel the kind of warmth and connection and excitement of meeting a new friend again so badly a feeling I can barely remember. tldr I cannot feel genuine connection with new people anymore. Is this a depression thing? I just want to feel genuine human connection again,Depression

22825,22845,So I am a 23 year old male who recently kicked all substances i was abusing marijuana nicotine alcohol caffeine. its been about 3 weeks and I do feel better than when i was self medicating with these substances which is to say i actually have moments where i feel good naturally. What I have noticed however is that i always get really intense dark thoughts and suicidal ideation around the same time each day around 2pm ish lasting until 56pm but sometimes lingering longer than that. There is no external stimulus causing this that I am aware of it happens both on work days and off days tho on off days i can just take a nap to avoid the intense depression. After i wake up i feel better. At work i just have to power thru and its extremely difficult.. as i work in retail and have to constantly interface with strangers. Could this just be my brain leveling out after years of artificial dopamine hits? I have yet to see a therapist due to a lot of anxiety about opening up as well as the cost but i know its something i need to do. Just wondering if anyone here has had similar experience? Thanks Intense dark thoughtssuicidal ideation at the same time every day?,Depression
18831,18851,I have tried for months to get help with my mental and physical health and nobody seems to want to help me. No anxiety medications for my generalised anxiety Disorder. No pain relief for my pain. No tests or answers to all my other health problems. I am clearly just being left to die so I might as well just do the job myself. I cannot cope anymore,Depression
21458,21478,Wow fuck the world I am going hermit mode I just got ghosted by the only person I knew,Depression
16605,16625,I am in my 20s and have lived on my own for a while. Have struggled with depression for a long time but a few months ago it seemed like things were starting to get better. That quickly faded as life came crashing down and my own deteriorated mental state saw me go and live with my grandma. Ever since I got here a couple weeks ago I have just continued to fall apart. Isolating myself more than I really should. It gets hard because the longer I go without talking the more anxious I get because I have not spoken. That leads to be withdrawing further because I am so ashamed of not talking to family that I cannot talk to them. I have expressed my depression a lot before but their whole mentality is essentially walk it off. I just got a new job which has been a big step for me but when I get home from a long days of work occasionally Ill talk to someone and they will be like you would have seen this happen if you were not hiding in your room all day in which Id respond no I was at work. So it does not matter whether or not I am in my room all day because they are too dumb to tell the difference. Aside from all this motivation is in the drain. Small tasks I put off for days. Then family asks me to do tasks they are too lazy to do like cooking food for others in which I am not allowed to partake and then when I am dragging my feet its always some form of criticism. Mental health is a hoax according to these people and I have tried so hard to escape my family because of how insensitive they all are to any form of struggle even though they have all had tough lives they just like to pretend nothing bad has ever happened and being around my family each day continues to drive me crazy. According to them I am a failure and I am lazy. Nevermind how hard I have worked over the last several years of life since I was told to fuck off by my dad the day after my 18th birthday. Never shall I ever experience peace Isolation and the struggle to do simple tasks,Depression
38636,38633,for the last few year or a long a i can remember i haven t enjoyed much of anything sometimes i ll enjoy when i hangout with friend or whenever i m with family but im extremely co dependent to the point where if im alone im depressed and even if im not alone i m probably depressed i just recently started antidepressant and i think they re helping but not really i don t really feel like i connect to people or build connection because im constantly thinking about about x problem i have or x thing that s wrong with me there wa a time period where i thought i wa a narcissist but i hate myself so that s impossible can somebody like help me lmao i also feel like i m a burden to everyone in my life because every time i speak to anyone or interact with anyone it s about how depressed i am or how something is wrong with me,Depression

17007,17027,When I was barely over the age of one cps took me away from my birth mom. Needless to say I was found in a terrible state. The very first family to take me in as a foster child eventually they were able to adopt me when I was 3. Sadly though I was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years I was a foster child which was ultimately detrimental in how I ended up. Luckily it was a closed adoption sadly though the parents who had adopted me had divorced a few years later. My mom got me and the other kids while occasionally we would see our dad. Though my mother would rarely let me see my father. It was obvious from the start I was different from other kids. I look back on it and I realize just how much of a struggle I had to deal with. I attended special classes for my speech impediment I was always getting bad grades and I just did not understand ANYTHING. Instead of getting me help my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. I just recently found out that she knew I always had ADD but never told me. She would ground me for not crying when someone I did not love would die. I was always getting grounded and I was never allowed inside the house. No matter how hydrated I would get she would not allow me inside and she worked me like a slave. Only ever cleaning when I was inside. Eventually I ended up living with my dad and his new wife when I became a teen. I ended up getting caught having sex and my father who was extremely strict grounded me for years. I started getting treated like I was a dirty person and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. And to this day I am still treated like this. What more I went back and forth between my mom and dad eventually I was kicked out before I could graduate and have struggled ever since. I always struggled with depression but as soon as I became an adult I started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. I started coming out to my family who I have Always had a rocky relationship with and was always shut down and told to stick it up. They ignored my pain and suffering and I refused to ever ask help from any of them. But my sister would always have my back she would make sure I would not be homeless. And now I just find myself in a rut. I am in the first relationship I have had for years and its terrible. He deceived me into believing he was someone else and like an idiot I feel for it. he is made us get into tremendous debt and now I find myself the lowest I could ever be. I have no motivation and I know I just cannot keep doing it anymore. I am tired and I do not care to live. I do not care what happens after this I just want to be set free from this misery. I also cannot help but resent my father he has so much money yet he refuses to help anyone. He says to work hard even if it means work 247 since he is an alcoholic. But I just struggle so much and the fact that he is out there spending ridiculous amounts of money on the dumbest of stuff but not on helping out his child that is struggling so much who finally admitted to him that I have been suicidal.I have come to realize that all the abuse I went through as a child has damaged me in a way that I can never hope to be normal. I still have a speech impediment but I have learned to become the silent character. I know that I have some form of autism I have looked up all the signs and I have worked so hard to understand myself. I do not want to be here anymore and I guess really I just want to be heard. Wanting Permission to Die,Depression

26644,26664,I just cannot take it anymore. I am so sad. I cannot take another rejection. Every woman I have ever loved has been taken away by a man who is 1 better than me. How am I supposed to keep my spirits up when its just one failure after the next? I am a manager in finance I am in shape just average looking not below just average. I am sitting by myself on a holiday tears in my eyes age 34 remembering apathy from everyone I have opened up toI do not know where to go from here. Do I just live a single life forever? Do I keep facing more rejection? This is awful. No more please,Depression

23395,23415,I really do not know how to describe it in intelligent ways but it affects everything I do. It feels like as I have gotten lonelier and lonelier there is a blanket filter applied to everything I do that takes away it is meaning and it makes it feel cold and isolating? it is this feeling especially when I am out in public or driving around or at work that I am just completely out of place I do not belong here and that no one around me is a person I can connect with or trust. I feel this feeling constantly and I want nothing but for it to go away. ampx200Bit is completely draining it makes me think in stupid ways and it makes everything in life feel emotionless or unreal. Sometimes it makes me feel like a passenger in a life I cannot control. I really wish I could describe it better but I am sure some of you have felt this feeling as well. it is also totally exaggerated by architecture I feel it the strongest during my commute through the beaten up concrete hell I live around and the feeling is completely absent whenever I find myself in a place that just... looks cozy a place with lots of nature and life? I do not know lol. It feels like there is a filter over my life.,Depression

12469,12489,I am a 22 years old female in a relationship I have no issues when it comes to that we get along well.My main issue is myself I am tired all the time I get bored easily my mood changes a lot I literally feel the slightest change in his voice and tell myself OMG HE GOT MAD. I started having stomach pains when I stress or when I feel sad and I actually started shaking when speaking or interacting with new people. This never happens to me before I used to talk in college in front of 50 people and do well.cannot say I have any goal in life I do not wish for something tbh and most of the time I just feel sad for no reason.What upsets me the most is when I think too much. For example I forgot the meaning of a sign for the driving school so now I just feel worthless feel like I am a failure that I cannot do anything all for a damn sign.This happens even if I scratch a small thing I immediately think this is what I do all the time I just break stuff that I am clumsy and worthless.I told to my husband he really tries to help me but tbh I do not even know what causes it. I am supposed to be a psychologist myself and I swear I cannot find any childhood trauma any real issue.If anyone could help me in any way I would really appreciate. Not sure how to feel anymore,Depression

48250,48230,Wasting away First time Poster so I apologize in advance for any formating issues. I just came to realize how numb I feel today. For some contest I 24F have been struggling mentally pretty much since childhood.I've had low selfconfidenceanxiety and have been pretty depressed for as long as I can remember. Life has always kinda sucked and any good times usually don't last more than a couple of days so I guess all the hurt and disappointment has been building up and now I'm almost completely numb aside from the random anxiety attacks at 3am.I've been aware of this for a while but the sheer extent of how tired I am and how I don't care about anything anymore hit me today when I found out that all the neglect towards my studies has caught up to me and will most likely result in me either barely passing uni or not even being able to graduate meaning I will have no degree and just wasted a bunch of time for nothing. The tought of that used to scare me but now I just don't care that much . I am so lost on how to improve but at the same time I don't have the desire to do anything about it. All I wanna do is sleep and not wake up I wish time would just stop. I don't know why I'm writing this for some advice maybe ?or just venting to strangers online is alot easier and cheaper than therapy.,Depression

25464,25484,I have had lifelong clinical depression. I treat it with medication and therapy and for the last few months I have been doing super well! I am actually happy to be alive and look forward to things which is fun and new. I have been a little out of sorts for the last few days which I attributed to being on my period. But today I woke up and it just slammed me. Horrible nightmares could barely get out of bed. Now I feel once more like I am walking through molasses and constantly fighting the urge to cry. What gives? Anyone else had this happen to them? Should I be doing something else? I just feel like I have been catapulted into the middle of a yearlong depressive episode with none of the buildup. is not it at least supposed to take me out to dinner first? For context I have been working through some pretty heavy past trauma in therapy and making great strides. Depression came out of nowhere,Depression

14408,14428,I am just curious do you think these 2 things are related? So for example if someone lives in southern California or coastal Spain where the sun is out most of the year and the weather is quite warm and pleasant are they 'happier' than someone who lives somewhere with 4 proper seasons including winter with cloudssome snow etc.? let us just say these people in either location are fairly happy in their jobscareerslives and are paid a decent amount to enjoy a middle to upper middle class life.Is anyone in this subreddit reading this living in such a place with year round mostly warm sunny weather? If so how is this life exactly? Are you happier living in such a place? Or not. I suppose this can all be very individual. I am just wondering if living in such an environment could make someone 'happier'.If you Google what are the happiest countries in the world all of these countries listed are in climates with 4 seasons and some pretty harsh winters. InterestingThe 10 Happiest Countries in the World Finland. For the fourth year in a row Finland is number one when it comes to happiness. Denmark. Denmark remained in the number two spot this year. ... Switzerland. ... Iceland. ... Netherlands. ... Norway. ... Sweden. ... Luxembourg. ... Happiness and weathersun,Depression
8274,8294,I have been dealing with depression since I was 16 and now I am 27. I have been eating sweet's for a long time. My sugar intake has to be through the roof. But just a few years ago I thought about suicide and I attempted it a few times. I failed. But instead I decided that I could not deal with the short pain of going through that and possibly surviving. Most people eat unintentionally to suppress their feelings or to feel better. But I decided if I am going to kill myself that is it is going to be slow and I am going to enjoy it. I have been overeating intentionally eating food to gain weight eating so much sugar that it is all I have got.Maybe I will stop but for now I am happy killing myself. I have been slowly killing myself with food,Depression

19345,19365,Life is fucking horrible. I do not want to be happy anymore I am tired of hoping. I got attached to being drained mentally. If its morally right to commit suicide I would probably do it without hesitation. Fuck being me. They said better days are coming well based on my experience it will not i should prolly stop hoping like it will come someday. I have lost interest in everything. Starting now Ill disassociate myself with the world fuck everyone is expectation of me fuck everyone is perception of me. I was a kind person before I guarantee that Ill start being cold now fuck it. I just hope I die soon enough on my bed while sleeping,Depression
12998,13018,No matter how many times I try no girl ever pays attention to me. Some have said they find me cute funny or even both but they ghost me after a few days. it is not like my insecurities scare them away I hide that part of me very well since I know is a massive turn off. I put on a confident face and take the first step mainly because no one ever approaches me so I have no option. I am not creepy i do not go straight into sexual stuff or anything like that. My friends say my insecurities are based on nothing but how come that if I am so pretty and fun no woman ever chooses me? I mean I do not blame them.I know there is nothing wrong in them the problem is me but I do not know what to fix. I am tired.I want someone to take on dates and kiss it is not even sex what I crave since honestly my antidepressants make having sex pretty boring. I feel like such a loser. I hate myself and I hate that I let this affect me so much because I know my worth is not based on how many people are attracted to me but it would be nice if a girl I find pretty thought the same about me. I feel so unlovable I do not want to be single forever but girls do not like me and I am tired,Depression
24868,24888,I tried to kill myself many times for more than a decade with no success. it is so hard to do it because I am such a coward. I was never good at anything. Maybe I should get cancer and die a honourable death. Even If I manage to commit suicide people will say I am weak and selfish treat me with contempt. Patients diagnosed with cancer are showered with love and praise. They can die with dignity and self respect. Sometime I feel I should get cancer and die...,Depression

10487,10507,Hey rdepression. Back to vent here once again. I went through a stretch where I have been doing better at handling my emotions via a few methods like taking a quick second to think of 5 things I can see 4 I can hear etc. its crazy how much that is helped me in day to day life but I have recently fallen back into patterns of negative thinking that are becoming increasingly debilitating. Whenever I am talking in a large group of people a good example of this kind of situation would be eating dinner with coworkers friends etc. I find myself fading. I think the proper term for this phenomenon I am trying to describe is depersonalization but I find that fading describes the feeling much more accurately. Ill be talking with someone one second and the next its like I have become more focused on my thoughts than the conversation and thus stop processing the words I am hearing like I am just zoning out. Big deal right? Everyone does that. The strange part is that I am not even thinking when I fade I just feel numb. The words I hear start sounding like a foreign language and I have existential feeling as if I am playing a game and the person in front of me does not actually exist. Everything just turns to shapes and noise. Like the world around me is literally blurring and fading away in front of me. Its hard to describe but there is almost a feeling of fear that washes over me when I fade. Its scary to feel and recognize yourself slipping away. Eventually I just come back and ask the person I am with what they just said to me but its very jarring whenever this randomly happens. I say random but these fading events are usually preceded by negative thoughts It all just feels fuzzy.,Depression
39731,39728,i had plan for the future big plan they don t exist anymore a relatively recent assault took them from me the assault also took away my ability to enjoy being out of my house the thing that once made me happy no longer do i can t take care of myself i m on med but they don t help i get up and go through the motion but on the inside i am dying i am just a shell of who i once wa what s even the point why am i still trying,Depression
11613,11633,For me it is when I have time to sit and think about things. What do I want to do what is missing? it is when I realize how much fun I used to be. And how much fun life used to be. I suppose it is depressing when you begin to realize that the older you get the less there is to look forward to and diminished excitement increases while your energy levels and motivation sets new lows with each passing week. Nothing helps anymore. Numbers in the bank account nice things spare time excercise not even time with family. Because something else I realized I do not know anybody anymore and now nobody knows me. Not the real me. there is just this now. This thing that is leftover after society poor decisions and everyone else has done their thing to me. Poor decisions. Faith in the wrong people. I am starting to think that life itself was a poor decision. I tried before haphazardly honestly out of boredom. I was literally so bored and alone that I literally tried suicide because fuck it why not? Sounded fun at the time. Now I only enjoy things vicariously through others. Like a ghost. Life has become a spectator sport. And you just watch and wait for the clock to wind down because there is nothing else of interest to do or it involves other people and I do not want to ruin anyone's day or life anymore. there is more but who cares anyway? I could write a book on this shit but so what? Who would read it? This society's become a dead end for people like me. And now honestly I do not even care anymore. it is been fun here and there I guess. What depresses you the most?,Depression

38473,38470,hey there feel good to talk to people who just a me suffer depression i never talked about it much on the internet though one of my best buddy who is a psychiatrist my parent and some other people know about it it s not many and i feel it s better this way but at least i can talk about it here a i am anonymous on the internet i hope anyways for me it s been many year that i am in a severe depression mine ha developed through a chain of various dumb decision i made that lead me to the place i m at now thing i can t change now can t simply make forgotten since the wheel of time keep spinning it s really interesting though a a 9 year old me would have never believed to suffer severe depression year later though it started many year ago back a a 9 year old i just graduated from school successfully and had every possibility like the world wa open to me a luxury many people sadly don t have and i wa dumb enough to not see clearly ahead of me thinking about what i wanted from life or where i would love to end up now i know and thinking back my 9 year old self should have known it s not really hard to figure out and i would tell my 9 year old self to think about it and keep chasing his dream especially since there wa so much time for it the path i walked though wa a pretty dark one nothing criminal nothing that would at first glance appear a particularly dark but i managed to scare away many people that in retrospect would have been great buddy friend and even girlfriend relationship like the old saying say you are your own worst enemy it s true it really is i have experienced it myself a far a i know there are two kind of depression depression that is genetically biologically caused and depression that is the product of bad experience and decision you made let s call it a reactive depression for me a you can imagine it wa the second and i could punch myself for it a what i did in all these previous year wa almost a textbook example of what not to do bad decision the worst part is that i have this mental image of an alternate reality where i didn t decide the way i did where i wa smarter and while i know it s a mental image it doesn t feel that way the worst thing is it s a devil chain a bad experience lead to me feeling worse while some people learn to hide their depression and keep smiling and joking in front of others just so that others won t realize how you truely feel i don t have that gift a i am usually in a bad mood and are perceived a a very unfriendly person by others which again lead to social alienation which make my depression even worse it s gotten really worse the last few year interestingly after coming back from being homeless and living on the street for half a year to a point where i don t want to live anymore where i want to forget,Depression

17385,17405,I feel like if I did not have other people in my body Id be dead by now. I hate typing like this its disgusting. But that is really how I feel. Like I am not even living my life anymore. Just watching whoevers fronting take on every shitty part of it. And I know if I was fronting wed all be dead. I have never felt so I cannot even think of a word that would depict exactly what I am feeling. These dreadful feelings and toxic people around me everywhere I go. Everyone looking right through me telling me where I should go what I should do who I should be by just snapping my fingers and hoping Ill get there. I feel like a failure. I feel like death already. I feel like nothing on top of every miserable feeling a person could have. Nobody understands me nobody sees me when looking at this body. They do not even notice I am not there anymore. I am not the one talking to them laughing with them eating with them. I am dying inside wondering why they only see what they want to see. I hate it. I HATE it. I hate that this is the way my body protects me. By keeping all my feelingsme behind a smiling face. Its so lonely. I am so alone. Death looks so beautiful on days like this. So fucking beautiful..

9428,9448,Title says it all. Why am I so fucking sad after I go for therapy? Is this normal? My heart hurts. I feel empty and achey and just fucking sad. I am a bike messenger and sometimes when I am riding I get so lost in my own head I forget where I am or where I am going until some car blares its horn at me. I do my best to keep a straight face when I am with people but I am fucking sad. I have been trying to exercise it off biking swimming weights. Also been binge eating potato chips while I watch TV. Also been crocheting. I have hung out with friends too. I feel like I am doing all the right things to try and make that gnawing empty ache in my heart stop but it are not going away. Any suggestions? I am so fucking sad after every therapy session,Depression
21707,21727,I have wanted to die for a long period of my life but the truth is is that I am actually terrified to die and i think I tell myself I want to die to make myself think I am not afraid of deathI'm not really sure who I am I constantly need to be around others who give me some sort of insight of who I am in order to feel like myself. Because I really have no idea. I could not tell you what I like or what I do not like I am constantly anxious scared worried sad but I always tell people I am okayI tell people okay because I do not feel that I deserve any empathy or sorrow. I have zero confidence in myself. I usually end up quitting my job because I do not think I do good enough at work or even deserve to make money to take care of myself. I am addicted to nicotine alcohol and adult films on the internet. I do not necessarily really know how I am actually feeling all the time sometimes I think I am not actually awake or alive even. I broke up with my ex because I thought she deserved better. I hate being alone but only because I like being alone when i should not be. A dream of mine since I was a kid was to be known to have some sort of legacy but I honestly do not think I will ever achieve that. I tell people I do not believe in God when I actually do but think that I am not worthy of a God. I am struggling with identity crisis. But I have zero motivation to solve this problem. I am constantly unmotivated when it comes to things that are good for me but when it is bad for me I will stop at nothing to get it. I put myself in shitty situations because I like pain and think it is all I deserve. I constantly seek affirmation from others when really what I want is to feel comfortable in my own mind and body. I was molested when I was five years old. I have ADHD.I am afraid that when I die people will forget about me within a couple days. these are a few things I have been dying to get off of my chest,Depression
48055,48037,another episode is suddenly hitting me and i dont want it to i wish i could stop it so badly i can feel an episode comingggg its fucking terrible i know how bad it will get i just want to smash my head against the wall rn my social battery is dying out too like I CAN FEEL AN EPISODE HITTING ME AND I DONT WANT IT TO i hate it when i have depressive episodes like its just suicidal thoughts constantly and honest to god just thinking about it is eating away at me because i wish i could do anything to stop going into that fucking state. but the cycle always repeats.like the past 10 days i had a really bad episode and i think these previous 2 days? it somewhat alleviated and i could actually move my body and interact with people and be fucking not miserable and have MOTIVATION TO DO SHIT but now another episode will hit me and i'll return to just laying around all day rotting away for hours. honestly fuck this its so frustrating not having any control over my god damn brain or emotions i hate it sm ,Depression
20485,20505,I am 23 and I have been battling with depression since 20089 but was not officially diagnosed until 2018 when I decided to finally get help. For the longest time I was terrified because of the stigma behind mental illness. I did not want to be seen as less than just because of my depression. There is so much that has contributed to my depression that I do not know what it is anymore. Between being bullied in school and at home to growing up in a violent household to being sexually assaulted at 17 to the loads of bullshit my father put me through then leaving and not having anything to do with me and so much more its all been bottled up so much. All I want to do is isolate away from family and friends. I do not want anything to do with anyone anymore and its hard for me to hold a conversation. I am surprised I have been making straight As in college I am working on my second college degree and a 4.0 GPA with all of this going on but to me that does not help or validate me in any way. I feel so lost and I feel like suicide is my only way out but I cannot do that. I have a 2 year old daughter who needs me to stick around and the ONLY reason I have not attempted to take my life in the last two years I have had failed attempts is because of her and only her. I just do not know what to do anymore.. I am losing..,Depression
23814,23834,I hurt many people and some have left me and decided not to see me anymore. I do not know where they are or what they are doing. They hate me and I can tell. I just want to tell them somehow that I am sorry that I hurt them so much. I do not want them to come back that is not the point. I just want to know they are doing okay and that they will continue to be doing okay. that is all I just want. I just want closure,Depression
47417,47402,I'm trying I'm trying. Everyday.i started to drink a little tonight and I began to remember pain. Pain that I'm trying to suppress. Pain that im scared to see and look at. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trying every day not to break but it's getting hard tonight. The truth is I'm scared. I'm scared of death. I'm scared of the future. I'm terrified of myself. I look in a mirror and I'm disappointed disgusted and I hate who I am. I only poor my heart out here cause I'm too much of a pussy to do it to anyone. I can't. It's a hard night tonight. I'm sorry.,Depression
15460,15480,Why am I like this? I do not know. Do you? I do not know how I even made it this far in life when i hate living every single second of it. I just wish it would end my suffering the pain. I just need it to stop. I tell myself your fine! Just shake it off. Its just a phase but is it though? Why am I like this?,Depression
11165,11185,I have been dealing with anxiety and depression for awhile now and its in a huge part to my ADHD. It makes me feel like I cannot really do anything whether by myself or with someone is help. Yet I want to do so many things and try to do them. But every time I start to do something I get so confused and frustrated and angry that I have to stop before I break something. So I push it aside and hope to try it again later. This happens a lot. And I cannot see a way out of it. Its like I am trapped in a room with a thousand doors each with something behind it for me to do options. But every time I try to open one its like it ways 200 pounds and needs an incredible amount of strength to open. And when it is finally open there is another door just like it right behind. I keep trying to open these doors with different keys in different ways but its exhausting. Yet there is one door that only needs to be opened once and it does not seem to be that heavy. I keep feeling it pull at me when ever I get in a bad mood. A door whose key has always been with me and everyone owns. Most people want to push this key away pretend its not an option. But its always there waiting for the day to fulfill its purpose. Because everyone will go through that door one day whether they are prepared on not. I hate looking at the door but what I hate more is the idea that due to me opening none of the doors I will become nothing and disappoint everyone I care about for the rest of my days. I think that is much worse than me opening the easy door. But Ill keep trying. I just hope I can choose the right door for me before the one door chooses me. Sorry if this post feels off topic I just need to put this into words. I only see one door to open right now.,Depression

39048,39045,curious to see what people think here s my question can dissociation also be described a separating yourself from thing event happening in your life for example if something happens that overwhelms me or make me really anxious a lot of time i simply forget it i ll be going along with my day a normal but feel that something is off so i ll have to sit for a moment and think why do i feel sad anxious etc and after a minute of thinking back it click oh right i have to give a presentation on thursday is this a form of dissociation it ha always happened to me and if i describe it to someone they usually don t understand it i e if i m anxious i can t stop thinking about whatever it s about let alone forget it i told my therapist about it one session and she thought it wa fascinating she said that anxiety is stored in the body too so that s why i can feel the negative feeling even if i forget why it s there just curious i m not seeing that therapist anymore or else i d ask her,Depression

It feels like I am cursed just like my depressed sibling who is in their early thirties and also has the same faith like me.I am doing great at school and work but I do not care at all for this stuff. I do not want to become 30 or 40 years old with a great job Id rather have the family life that I now realise I will never have. I am not asking for any advice or good words I just needed to get this out and see if someone else feels like me even though I do not want to live never wanted to I am not going to kill myself and just suffer and be miserable every day. I am going to stop doing my makeup or skincare or dress well and just exist I do not want to live anymore after realizing Ill never have my own family,Depression

18961,18981,Twmention of suicide mention of self harmI'm going through intense feelings these last weeks because I am depressed never really injured myself or tried to do something worse but the feelings the thoughts and the sensory overload were raging in my head.I am still searching for a good med to help me but yesterday my brain just stopped saying those things. Just completely silent. No more killing myself thoughts no more harming myself....I am in shock. Today I am okay too! I has happened before and it was more frequent that I was in a ok mood and knew I was getting better for the moment.But I am SO afraid that those things go back to happening I do not want to tire myself out with work I do not want to play gameswatch series and get sad or any feelings tbh... I want to enjoy the peace and quiet and at the same time I want to go back to normal and work on the stuff I like finish some games talk with friends...Because it is getting kind of rare these moments my brain just do not go full die mode I am so afraid to not just enjoy the moment or to do something productive. My body is tired but I really do not want to keep myself in bed anymore. I am sleepy too bc family is noisy and could only get like 5h of sleep.I want to do activities but I am not sure if I should. What do you think? I have left the pit and I am afraid,Depression
18151,18171,Not sure if I am allowed to share the link here but it is called 'How to recover from depression' on youtube. It contains a very thorough and wellreasoned perspective on depression its multitude of causal factors the effects the need for a unique treatment plan not just meds talking exercise that is based on the causes of your individual depression. it is made me feel slightly more in control slightly less prone to believing my negative thought castles and slightly more hopeful. Overall I feel significantly less depressed right now after over a week of full on black dog mode. Highly recommend giving it a look. Watched a video that lifted me up for the first time in days,Depression
24066,24086,I have had what is likely depression for about 3 years now. I do not know why it came about and I do not understand why its going away. But its wrong and I do not want to get better.I am so used to the familiarity of it. There was a certain amount of comfort to those feelings of numbemptiness or just plain heaviness. I had my low times I selfharmed and it sorta got better for a week before going downhill the cycle repeating 2 weeks after. It was reliable. It was known. It made the highs feel better.But for a few months now I have been by most views improving. I have less depressive episodes. It went from 3 weeks to 5 to 8. The sadness behind the selfharm is fading and as it does the strength of temptations grows weaker.And yet I cling to what remains. I am not ready to get better. I am not ready to lose the comfort of harming. The depression is part of who I am at this point and I do not know how to live without it. Perhaps because my depression never had a clear because there is no closure nothing in my life has improved to justify or explain me getting better.I am here because my partner suggested I ask if anyone else has experience with this. I am not really sure how much you all will know of this but its worth a shot. Thank you in advance. I am getting better and I hate it.,Depression

10910,10930,Hey redditI am tired of feeling alone tired depressed and just feel like I am going through each day with nothing to look forward to. My day is the same everyday. Sure I know I have people that love me but it seems like forever since I have actually felt like a had a good day. I am sure I am not the only one in this group that feels this way. I like to believe that there is some sort of better life down the road. I have given up most of my hobbies because I am to depressed to care about them. it is a battle every day just to even reach out to someone and not just scorched earth what few friends I have. I do not need to bring them into this sad little world I live in.that is my rant for the day and I just wanted to put it out there. I have given up.,Depression

15676,15696,I was just starting to get into a good groove. I was eating better exercising and starting to enjoy my hobbies again. Prepandemic things were not looking all that bad. Now I can barely get through a day. Normally I would not give a shit I have been depressed off and on throughout most of my life but its harder when you have a wife and a kid. Dealing with other people and trying to keep up appearances is exhausting. I am stuck in the hole again and I cannot claw my way out. The pandemic destroyed all the progress I made.,Depression

12063,12083,I do not have any energy left waking up from bed feel like a chore. I am an emotional mess nowadays crying at times and other time I just feel numb. I just lost my appetite. I always wanted to be a doctor but I did not got a medical seat in the entrance exam so I joined the engineering college which I never liked in the first place but I did not wanted to waste another year in repeating the medical entrance so I joined the engineering course. I never got along with my teachers as I was a student who came to the college via intercollege transfer from another engineering college they never paid attention to me or helped me in the subjects. At the final year seminar they purposely cut short my internal marks in that seminar. I had enough of that they had already caused enough hurdles to me in those 3 years I had been there. I decided to not pursue that course. My 4 years of my life has been wasted. I sat another 3 years doing nothing. I was already depressed about not being completing the engineering course. I spend the next 3 years mourning about it. I sometimes feel like to try again for medical entrance one last time but I do not have any energy left as I see my school friends has achieved a degree as well as a job in all these years and I am at the bottom trying to reach somewhere in life. Also a lot of friends had been married or engaged and here I am 26 and reached nowhere. I feel like a utter failure. Sometimes I feel like if I get a medical seat by the time I complete it I would be a 32 year old and who would marry a 32 year old woman in a conservative country unless a divorcee or a widower with kids. On the other hand my mom is pushing me to get married and looking for grooms in matrimonial website for me as I am ancient according to her as I am 26. Even when I told her a thousand times that I am not mentally prepared to get married nor I like to live with inlaws she never listen to me. It makes me more depressed than I am already is. I always pray that I just die in my sleep and never wake up the next day. The only reason I am not committing a suicide is because I do not want to be born again in this earth if reincarnation exist as I had cut short my life by suicide then I will be born again to complete the remaining time I would have been alive in past life in the reincarnated life or if a life after death exists and I will not be allowed to meet my loved ones on the other side because I took my own life. I did not believe in things like this but I came across a youtube channel called matt fraser a psychic medium and whatever I had learned from watching it is this that life after death exist and I do not want to take chances to not meeting my loved ones on the other side that is the only reason I am not taking my life. I feel dead inside. I feel dead inside,Depression
26133,26153,I am depressed since way back and my appetite goes through periods of highs and lows but mostly it is low and right now it is like nonexistent. i have lost a little weight and only eat like once a day because i really cannot bother. my house is a disaster so the kitchen is all gross and full of shit and no clean plates or anything sp i just eat microwavable food. am tired of pizza and cansoup but do not know what else i can eat. I am very picky and vegetarian. so what can i do? how do you get your appetite back when you are never hungry and you do not hve the energy to make food or eat?? i want to build the body i want but i feel it is impossible because i cannot motivate myself or even gather the strength to try. how to fix low appetite?,Depression

13395,13415,3 years ago I went back to university after dropping out previously. I felt like this could be a new start and I would turn my life back around. But my behaviors did not change and I ended up even worse than before. I have learned nothing. I am again failing my classes and will probably be expelled again.I am honestly a waste of time and money. My parents invested in me and I feel like a scammer who dragged them into a bad business deal. I have wasted so much money that I honestly feel like my parents could have bought another home with it. I always felt weird when people were committing suicide because they felt like their loved ones would be better off without them. Even in my darkest times I always felt like I contributed something to make someone is day better. But recently I definitely feel like my family would be better off without me and I was just delusional. The most ironic thing is that this could have been prevented if i had less hope in myself. I would have taken the easy route without having to prove myself or anyone else that I could do better. But now I have only proven myself that I am a fuck up.I honestly just hope for a fast and easy death and that my suffering will not last so long anymore. I wish I gave up sooner,Depression
11377,11397,I am 20 years old M and have been having recurring nightmares for the past month that my gay best friend 34M blew me while I was blackout drunk and passed out. I was slightly worried that it might not have been a dream but thought there was no way he would ever do something like that.For some background He had tried to stick his hands down my pants numerous times one night doing it successfully once and fondling me. I did not talk to him for a year and told him when I got back in contact with him how much it messed me up and that if he ever did anything like that again Id never speak to him. He promised me he would not.Today I was messaging him and told him that I got a new girlfriend and he made a comment saying that he wishes he could have blown me again. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about and he said nothing I guess... and we conversed a bit more and he said that he sucked my dick when we were both drunk.I genuinely thought it was just a vivid nightmare but it was not. I feel violated in shock devastated enraged and a million other emotions I cannot begin to describe. I do not know how to deal with this. I have been depressed lately and going through a lot as it is and this is another huge blow to my mental health.Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I Was Raped By My Best Friend amp do not Know How To Process It,Depression

47167,47155,feel like crap tonight i dread when the sun goes down. because im officially all alone without anyone to keep me company to keep me out of my head. normally i sleep pretty well despite it all. i get to bed pretty okay. but for the last week super vivid dreams have been causing me to wake up anxious and feeling like i barely slept. and what do i do to stop it? just sleep more! i havent woke up before 400 in the evening for the last week. i just dont know what to do anymore. when i am up if no one is around or im not on the phone with someone i just cry. i cry and dwell on how crappy everything is right now. then i progress to berating myself for throwing pity parties all the time or how hateful im starting to get with others in my sheer exhaustion. im sick of this. i just want it to stop.,Depression
17791,17811,I really do not know what to do. I feel so alone but I know I am not. I do not want to tell my family or friends because I do not want them to be concerned or worried and I have lost friends because I was to depressed.Its so much more than just migraines but they have been the biggest issue lately. I have been suffering from migraines since I was a child but they have gotten so much worse the last couple years. I have been missing a few days a months and have had to leave a few times a month early from work because of them. My workplace has told me if I miss more work I will be let go. I honestly do not want to live anymore. I have been depressed since I was a teenager and have I usually lie to everyone including therapists because I honestly do not feel justified in most of the saddepressedangry feelings I experience. I am so lost and no one I know knows what I am going through. I do not even know why I am posting but it feels kind of good to get some of this out even if i will delete it soon I want help but I am scared to ask for it,Depression
22976,22996,I just turned 20 and noticed my hairline receding rapidly I am freaking out and l have no clue what to do I used to think I was safe because I had thick hair like my mom which her side of the family is good. I literally cannot sleep at night knowing ill be a full egg head one day and taking showerslooking at my bed sheets is severely depressing seeing all the hair go. I am still young why the fuck is this world so cruel? balding at 20 literally end my life,Depression
47920,47902,Im so lost I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. Even when I was young I wasnt really happy. Anyway I was diagnosed in my early twenties. I have learned how to live with depression how to alleviate it etc. I havent really been to therapy a lot for several reasons. Lately I dont have the energy for most things. I can barely make it through the day. I have deadlines and things to do and I really really want to get out of this vicious cycle and get better. But every now and then I completely lose hope. I dont really want to die because despite everything I maintain my optimism that things can and will change. But in the meantime how am I supposed to function to get there? Change only happens with actions. I dont have the energy. Ive lost all motivation. My main problem these days is whats the point? I see whats going on in the world and everything is going to shit. People are fake as fuck. The only things that matter to society are extremely superficial. I dont understand how people function in this society. Its probably also helpful to mention that my home life is an epic disaster. I had to move in with my parents because I dont work currently thank you depression and for the past year and a half they have been in a preseparation mode that they wont conclude. I think that both of them are narcissists who ultimately only care about themselves. My mom holds me responsible for her marriage and she has played the victim her whole life. My dad is a narcissistic liar who wont deal with the truth. My siblings are pretty toxic and I am the one that they all depend on for emotional support. The thing no one is really there for me. Anyway. This was a rant I needed to let out because I dont really have anyone to vent to. I dont want to burden my boyfriend with my depression he doesnt deal well with it. I dont want to tell my friend about this because they have their own problems and we barely ever get to talk they all live abroad. I rarely meet people who understand me. Can anyone relate to my story?,Depression
47759,47743,Life is shambolic and i think im done Where do i even begin? Ig 1st for apologising as this will be a mess and ive never used reddit before so idek if im even doing this correct. I just cant do this shit no more. Like im pathetic. 16 and my life is so deplorable that im alone no1 cares for me every1 hates me and im a failure even to my parents. Ive already tried killing myself once before and i couldnt even do that right clearly. That was like 8 months ago and NOTHINGS CHANGED. In fact its probs worse somehow. I just dont know what to do. From being friendless through my own doing from being hated by my family from being attempted robbed by knife point less than a week ago from being a complete failure and disappointment. I just dont know anymore. Funny thing is everything is so much worse than 8 months ago but im still here fighting as if things r gonna get better when ik they aint. All i do is overthink abt every lil interaction conversation and how life could be such better that it consumes all of my energy to the point where i cant concentrate at school bc all i can think abt is killing myself and how i just should. What makes it worse is that this is only the 2nd time ive ever talked abt this shit bc i can't. Not even to myself. Whenever some1 asks how i am once in a millenia i cant be honest. I just smile and say generic bs. When im not ok. I just bury my head in the sand and pray it gets better that itll go away. IT NEVER FUCKING DOES. NOT IN 2 YRS IT HASNT. So y should it change now? The voices r winning and idk what to do. I just want to die. The world would probs be better off anyway. Let me go thru spotify once more and i think im done. Ty and sry,Depression

26756,26776,TW Brief mention of Abuse Murder and SelfharmIt's the anniversary of the day my nephew was born and it is been a nearly a year since his death. I do not want to get too into it but to give you some context last year my sister had a placental abruption while pregnant which was caused by physical trauma inflicted by her husband to her stomach. My nephew was born with a brain bleed and severe brain damage as well as other physical afflictions. Eventually a month later we had to let go of him because there was just nothing the doctor's could do. This and a lot of other factors led to one of the worst spirals I have had in my life.Anyway today I thought everything was alright. I was going about my day and I felt empty. But this is my usual state so to me I was perfectly fine. So I texted my sister to see how she was. It was alright the first couple of texts we sent back and forth but then she mentioned the card box she had for writing cards every birthday for Adriel. She also mentioned Our little parasite which was something I wrote on mine. And I guess it was this specific detail caused all the memories of that horrible time to resurface even though I thought I was fine. I sat and hyperventilated in my chair for about an hour after that. I feel like my depression is always prevalent but at that time period for the months that followed his death were particularly bad. This event was not the only thing that caused me to go off the deep end but I supposed you can call it the catalyst. I can feel the echoes of those feelings now and I want to cut again so bad. I just want all of this to stop. Happy birthday Adriel. I do not know if you are in a better place because I am not sure if I believe that but if there is a better place I hope you are there. You did not deserve to have this happen to you. You deserved a long happy life and I would have spoiled you rotten. I hope that the one that did this to you gets the justice he deserves. Rest in peace. Anniversary of My Dead Nephew's Birth,Depression

7770,7790,First time posting here. There is so much on my mind. I just cannot find it in me to think I am worthy of anything. I work myself to the bone and get very little appreciation. Its really been taking a toll on me. I used to love what I do and now I feel like I am just taking advantage of. I have never been a fan of my appearance. Physical I have been overweight my whole life and recently been trying to change that but with the work I am putting in I feel like it does not make a difference. I just want to feel happy about myself but I just cannot seem to find anything to be happy about. Only thing that makes me smile anymore is my 3 kids. They are about the only people that make me fee appreciate in some way. That being said they usually want mom over me but I understand that. I am just been feeling worthless and I cannot seem to get myself out of the ditch of sadness. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any help given. How to find self worth?,Depression
15097,15117,When you are constantly treated like scum but have to pretend that everything is ok. When you are under constant stress because someone wants to have you under control so that their life is easier. When there is no escape because depression and anxiety got the best of you and now you are unable to do anything anymore.I never thought I would be able to have so much hate in my heart. I always try and forgive people but I cannot and will not forgive someone who is ok with putting me down so that they can live a comfortable life and feel good about themselves. I never thought I would be able to hate the way I do,Depression
16524,16544,I feel empty and numbLike I know what I have to do for myself but I do not see a point. I am having so much trouble finding therapy that I can afford and that would work for me. Nothing is fun. I went to a party and basically slept through the whole thing. I feel bad because I keep venting to friends and they are great. And they say they do not mind. But too much is too much and I feel like I should really cut it off there.I am in a relationship with someone who unintentionally has hurt me greatly in the past and I am still trying to unlearn and forgive that. I am constantly uncertain. I cannot get out of bed and I cannot stand feeling guilt and weight on my shoulders for being uncertain for having a learning disability for taking my time for standing up for myself. I have very little fight left in me and being by myself makes matters feel worse I do not know,Depression
14011,14031,Hey guys I really do not know how Reddit works so I am giving this a try. Never thought my first post would be on something like this. Not sure if it falls under depression but its been hard to keep going. I am not thinking of suicide or anything crazy but I have recently fallen into the mentality of what is the point? I am 21 years old I have plenty of friends even a girlfriend. I used to love going to the gym every day and now it feels like a chore. Everything I do feels like a chore. Recently I have been thinking that I am just doing all of this to get a good paying job work a 95 and call it a day. At the end of the day I am just going to die eventually could be tomorrow or 60 years from now. I cannot really talk to my parents about it because they tell me you have friends a girlfriend and a job you have nothing to be sad about When people ask me what is wrong I do not really know what to say because nothing in my life is worth being sad over. From an outside point of view my life is great but its easier to tell people I am fine than explain things. I do not really know what I expect to come of this post but typing it out has helped me out a bit. Thanks for reading. New User,Depression
23579,23599,You all know too well what depression is. It sucks. I suck. I am not okay I am not happy. I cannot see any solution to this. I do not want to die but I want to disappear. I am going to let this consume me,Depression
10258,10278,I am gay and I have never really had any struggle with my family and friends accepting this but I have always had a problem with myself because of it. I guess I could call it internalised homophobia. I was in straight relationships growing up but would find a way to ease my thoughts of being gay by watching lesbian tv shows or shows with lesbian relationships. This meant that I would get overly attached with the characters and if they would break up or argue I would spiral into a depressive state that I would have to have therapy to help get back to a normal place. Now I am 21 and I have never had a gay relationship but I am openly gay and am finding ways to except that within myself. The problem is that I still fantasise about women I like in tv shows and the actresses that play them but its not necessarily that I want to be with them its that I want to be them. I start to change my lifestyle my clothing and things like that to mimic how a certain character acts. I talk about them day in and day out and it drowns me with emotion. It has not always been fictional women either as in school I found myself obsessed with female members of staff to the point where Id get so depressed knowing I could never be them and part of me would confuse this feeling for being in love. Which is of course highly inappropriate. I just do not know how to stop being so emotionally attached to the point where I want to die because I am so overwhelmed with caring about people who do not know I exist. Thanks for reading if you got this far. Deep attachment to fictional characters.,Depression

10062,10082,I struggle with depression since a while. Atthe beginning I had thaught circles as the one discribed down below quite often but as it continued it seemed like my brain got to lazy to think them to the end or the thaughts where more straight foreward.I just got flashed again with the thaught ofhow pointles my existence is. The earth our universe is around since a sooooo long time. And there are more than 7Mi Humans on this planet. Like... My existence does not matter at all.And I am just wondering how do others deal withtheir pointlessnes of their lifes. Seriously How?,Depression
9912,9932,I am sorry for my bad English these last weeks I have been feeling like... I am nothing my friends have been telling me that they want to stop talking to me and Idk why one after another they keep saying that other just ignore me. Also I have noticed that I am not entertained with anything even with videogames that was what kept me happy nowadays when I play videogames I just get bored I do not even have people to hang out. I know that this post does not make sense not even me know what I am writing I just wanted to say this maybe hoping to feel better with myself. Sorry for wasting your time to whoever read this. I hope you have a great day. I do not feel like living neither dying,Depression
15261,15281,I will be talking this over with my therapist as well but more to the point I think I may have finally found my... button? Fire? Motivation? I do not know what to call it really.ampx200BPerhaps I am getting too far ahead of myself here. Allow me to give you some information. ampx200BSo essentially depression is a static state of mind. It rarely changes. it is a very set in stone style of thinking. Of all the things I know one major aspect I learned was that depression or rather sinking into the thoughts and feelings of depression is very much like meditating. You sit there and focus on the pain the regrets the turmoil those feelings of worthlessness suicidality hopelessness and on and on it goes and it is so hard to challenge those thoughts because they get SO loud.ampx200BSo I have been studying researching everything and if you look through some of my posts on this sub you will come across some of my own theories and perspectives that deal with depression and functionality. ampx200BOk so niceties out of the way let us talk about the plan.ampx200BFirst of all is the center piece the schedule. I know I am low enough to need to schedule EVERYTHING. Bathing brushing my teeth sleep time and so forth.ampx200BHowever I am also taking this up a notch. The way I figure it I am either going to burn myself out and rupture or I will succeed. Either way I will be out of this mindset away from these feelings. ampx200BSo in terms of what else is going to be added.ampx200BTuesdaysWednesdays are usually my therapy appointments. ampx200BTuesday Thursday and Saturday are my gratefulness journal ampx200BI will be doing my own therapy session using CBT and I am thinking that will be once a week on Saturday to spread out between my therapy sessions and CBT sessions. ampx200BI am also going to force myself back into my old morning ritual. Pretty basic stuff starting at 530am get up brush my teeth morning meditation for 20 minutes cup of coffee and breakfast 30 minute walk shower and shave daily objectives journal.ampx200BI am also planning to add a self acceptance meditation into this perhaps twice a week which will be a 20 minute meditation geared towards embracing my neuroses. Reintigrating the fragmented parts of myself. ampx200BThe basic plan right now is to hold this schedule for 4 weeks to build that habit and then I am looking to quit smoking. I have been smoking for 14 years now and it is about time I quit.ampx200BAlong side all of this I also want to add on one last aspect. I want to volunteer down at my local homeless shelter. This will give me an outlet for my energy so it is not so geared towards being used as fuel for depression and at the same time gives me positive feedback in seeing how my actions can make a difference. Plus any kinds of friends I happen to find as well as looking for references so I have something to show when I attempt to get employment. ampx200BI have been working on this plan for literal months finding tid bits and pieces that I found crucial in forcing myself out of this. we are going nuclear. My mind does not have a problem sending nukes to destroy me so it is time to return the favor.ampx200BI have got several tools for practical use against daily depressive episodes such as the realization that I am literally meditating on that depression when I allow myself to sink into it. As well as a few other techniques such as bridging my thoughts this means subtly changing them bit by bit. So this is useless becomes maybe it is not as useless or I will never be able to do this becomes maybe if I give myself a chance I can do this things of that nature.ampx200BI have already beaten and almost entirely silenced the parts of me that were suicidal. So I know some of this stuff works. But that was target practice it is time for live fire. The real deal.ampx200BConsidering the tools I have got the information I have and everything else I believe it is time to make that change. I know I do not want to die like this. I want something more. But above all I know the most important detail. This all of this it is just practice. that is all. It does not need to be threatening it does not need to be scary. it is just practice. ampx200BBut what do you think? Feedback please? With a cherry on top?,Depression
12444,12464,I have been struggling lately with daily life tasks. Any hurdle as small as it is when executing daily life tasks can make me breakdown. Sorry for the english. But I do not have energy to check and double check. it is too much like everything. I put a lot of effort to get a good job a good life in a nice place but still struggling. I get angry disgusted from people's behaviors from how hard every task is. Cooking everyday cleaning washing clothes while keep focus on work and checking taxes paperwork keeping a smiling face when people talk to you. I have no interests i find everything dull and stupid how people get excited about products events. All those self discovery stuff while people on the other side of the planet are dying from bombs and hunger and while their neighbor is dying from cancer from the bad processed food our society has produced. You do not even know what to eat these days. I am overwhelmed stressed. Who am I ? Is what I am doing good? What next? What now? ...... So many questions so much uncertainty..... I am overwhelmed Overwhelmed by simplest things,Depression

10778,10798,I grew up poor and came to realize the only thing that will make someone happy is money. it is all I give a shit about.I am trying to become a nurse so I can have a high income and if I fail then there is no point in me trying anymore.Rent is skyrocketing around America healthcare is damn near impossible to afford and their saying us Gen Z will never retire. MONEY IS ALL THAT MATTERSAnd before anyone says Money will not buy you happiness or Fulfilment is what makes you happy you are fucking deluding yourself and you should be ashamed if you go around telling people that.When I see rappers like Lil Boosie flat out say money is the key to happiness I believe him not you! When I see comedians like Daniel Tosh get up on stage and say Of course it buys happiness There the ones that are right not your dirt poor ass. Without money I will end up killing myself,Depression

7494,7514,Hi I am early 20s M in Scotland and I have been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relateempathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadnessdepression and loneliness consequently which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of selfdoubt about myself. The relationship was quite oneway I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. There have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadnessIt's been a really hard time and I have been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. I have been paying for expensive private professional helpcounselling recently that i selfreferred myself to try console me through it but I think at the end of the day I really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. I do not really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoorsvague i know and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. I have tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. I do not know the best way to meet new people these days? in Scotland? Especially at this ageI appreciate it is a lothuge ask the amount I have went through just gets so overwhelming to process and I am just so lost and want guidance i do not know what to dowhere to go. I guess it is just so hard to see the wood for the trees and I do not know what to do and cannot see how things will get better. I feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve which makes me feel more hopeless. I want to get out of this rut I have been in for so so long and to feel lovedvalidated again and feel good about myself again as cheesy as that may sound. Sorry for a lowpost I do not like putting it upon people Crippling Loneliness after grim breakup,Depression

7318,7338,At the point I am at in life I could not really care if I die in 1 hour or a few days. My life over the past month has just been getting worse and worse which fueled by alcohol do not help. I still care about those around me but I do not see the point towards why I am here and why I have to be here. It just seems pointless and a waste of time and seems like a form of punishment. Just feel shitty and do not care anymore,Depression

20193,20213,I have been depressed for just over a year now. When things finally got too much I went to my GP which was about 2 weeks ago. Intiially I felt a little better but now I do not feel any better at all. I keep returning to talk to him because he wants to assess the treatment options available to me and see my progress over the weeks. But I find that when I go and talk to him because he already knows and is the only other person is have ever spoken to about how I feel there is a sense of calm that comes with it and I also typically have rehearsed what I will say in my head so when I get there it is prepared.I feel like he cannot see what is actually going on but even I have started to tell him that things are getting better.they are not.For some reason people associate my ability to candidly convey thoughts as an indicator that everything it is under control.it is not.I do not know what to do about this. If I was drowning before now I feel like I am drowning and the lifeguard is just watching. I feel like I am handicapping myself.,Depression
16785,16805,Something that my therapist and others do not get is that I can control my loneliness. I have been in therapy for a year to help with my loneliness but it being treated as a symptom of a bigger problem like social anxiety which I also struggle with. But I am also isolated not by choice or because I have anxiety. Some people have strong families that they can connect with and have a community with but not mine. They are extremely individualistic. My parents keep surveillance all the time. I feel like I am living in an mental institution I can do anything without my parents knowing. They take turns leaving the house so I am not alone. I cannot rely on my friends all the time. Literally just work and go home. I feel so disconnected from the world like my life is not real. Since therapy I feel like I have gotten worse for me. FYI I am 28 I am isolated and its making me depressed,Depression
13977,13997,So my roommate is one of my best friends and has been for some time. Today she told me she feels like she cannot talk to me about things because when I express my annoyance to her about not cleaning up after herself it hurts her feelings. I can totally understand where she is coming from and I am trying to do better but its hard. I have been telling her for some time that I expect her to clean up after herself in common areas after a reasonable span of time several hours to a day. This means cleaning the kitchen after cooking throwing out old food in the fridge vacuuming the dining room if the floor is dirty cleaning up the ash from her bong she self medicates with weed instead of going on antidepressants and seeking therapy etc. it just feels like I am the only one making an effort to clean and she only cleans if I ask her to. The problem is she says that executive functioning like cleaning is extremely difficult for her because she has depression and adhd. I can sympathize with her because I have OCD and mood regulation issues but I have no trouble keeping the common areas clean and prefer to do so. I just cannot be the only one doing it. I have tried explaining to her that I love living with her but its just frustrating being the only one who makes an effort to keep things clean. She takes this as me calling her lazy and disgusting even though I have never called her those things. She has this idea that everyone secretly hates her and will grow tired and abandon her and me being annoyed at her not cleaning is just a sign this is true. What can I do to make doing household chores easier on her aside from just doing them for her? I want to continue living with her but I cannot be her maid. Help with a depressed roommate,Depression
12720,12740,Anybody else feel like there dogcat is the only thing that stops them. My pets I feel as there the only thing stopping me then Ill tell myself they would be better off without me. I try not to feel like this but to this point the emotions the thoughts have me think why is this worth it if I cannot even make myself happy. The thoughts just keep coming and i just think down about myself and I just isolate myself. cannot leave the house just feel that I should rot alone Alone.,Depression
17969,17989,I was majorly depressed by the end of 2018 and decided to get help in 2019 and finally go to therapy. I went for about a year and everything seemed to be turning around. I got accepted into architecture school in 2020 during the beginning of the pandemic but thought everything would be fine but remote learning was not for me and i dropped out midsecond semester and now I do not really know if the profession would suit me. Along with losing my job that I have had since I got out of high school 7 years almost a month ago I am feeling really down and do not know what to do with my life. I badly want to get out of the retail rut and find out what I want to do but I constantly feel scared at trying out new things and just feel like I am not good enough to do anything else. I have been looking at my certificate courses at my community college but nothing seems to appeal to me I feel like nothing appeals to me in general anymore. I feel like all the artistic passions and drive I had growing up are just now gone and I just do not feel like doing anything. I have constant brain fog and feel I even have a hard time communicating now to the point where my speech seems so slowed down now and I have a hard time finishing sentences or thinking. Not to mention that I think my phone addiction also plays in all of this as well. I do not know what to do or where to start. I just do not know what to do. I feel like I am back to square 1,Depression

22084,22104,I am currently on 2mg of abilify aripiprazole which i pretty recently started as an antidepressant booster. However I have been sleeping pretty terribly waking up in the middle of the night andor waking up super early and having trouble falling back to sleep. now beforehand I had chronic insomnia in that I had trouble falling asleep but when I was out I was out. I treat this with cannabis which works like a charm for falling asleep but is not helping this issue.In the meantime before I see my psychiatrist I am curious to known is this usually an issue that persists? even in the short time I have been on this drug my mood and outlook have been way better to the point where people have told me they noticed a difference. I would hate to have to stop it so any insight is welcome thanks!! Abilify really helps with depression but is making sleeping difficult,Depression

38044,38041,recently i anonymously posted on my uni facebook page just to vent about my constant self doubt and how i struggle to do well in the course i want to succeed in because it s a dream job you can post anything there a long a it s uni related most comment were nice but this one absolutely unnecessary comment told me i should give up and how it s unfair that i m taking up space for others who will do better in my course like huh i know what they said is so off track and i should 00 ignore it cu they re a fking loser who know nothing about everything but i can t help but have it repeated in my head because i already have such a lack of self confidence in my skill and i genuinely believe that i m not cut out for it but i know damn well that i m trying what i can to achieve a goal despite everything around me but yeah needed to let this out i can t believe people like him exist it wasn t even just my post he shat on everyone else who wa struggling with uni how sad can your life be to do that,Depression
38949,38946,my anxiety affect my life but it s not debilitating for me like it is for others i get panic attack very rarely my brain is never quiet though it s always going and cycling around thought even when i m trying to let them go i see my dog and feel happy then my brain immediately say what if he died though and it show me what that would look like stupid thing like that i also have ibs that worsens with stress i guess i wa just wondering if anyone out there ha tried any med even though they can deal with their symptom and if it helped i m a bit worried about side effect but if i could just live without having to ob over thing and feel defensive all the time that would be pretty amazing i will ask my doctor of course but wanted to hear from others in my situation,Depression
24627,24647,there is nothing more to say. The guy seemed completely annoyed giving one sentence responses and when I told him he was being helpful he just ended the chat.Granted I am difficult to deal with but now I do not know what to do since the helpline is like a last resort kind of thing. Helpline made me feel worse,Depression

18063,18083,For half of my life I have dealt with depression. I think its at the worst its ever been for me and I have no clue what to do. I see a therapist virtually but I am not sure how much its really helping.I miss people I miss going to the store without worrying about getting sick. So now I just never leave the house. I am not even happy in the house. Its messy and unclean I am sad and have no energy or motivation. I am anxious far too often. I try to keep positive that it will get better but its taking ages. I feel jealous of people sometimes because they seem beautiful and healthy and happy. I was not like that before and of course you never know what people are dealing with. But I just want that happiness and health as well. Instead I hate myself and basically have no friends.Will it get better? I sure fucking hope so. I just wish I could disappear. Feel so cold and alone and overwhelmed,Depression
11320,11340,what would you do in my situation. for some background on my situation i cannot go out of the house unless its for work my mother calls me a whore sometimes even tho i legit do nothing my mother talks to me in a demeaning way my enabling dad supports her. I tried therapy but its not working only moving out will. I have abt 6k right now and will probably have 1.5 k left over each month at least after living expenses after i move out. So what should I do i have not properly hung out with anybody in a public place in 1.5 years unless it was sneaking out when my mom went to my aunts house and that caused a boatload of anxiety bc my mom would literally kill me if she found out. I am sick of this anxiety for wanting to normal 25 year old girl things not even cllubbing just hanging out with my bf or pals in a godamn park at 3pm. Move out or save more for my situation?,Depression
15104,15124,Hey I am just having one of those days. I miss you. I wish you were here right now. I wanted to share my emotions with you for you can understand me sadly the situation does not allow it. You probably think I betrayed you. I should not be bothering you in the first place and feed once more of your energy just so i can be okay. I just do not know what to do. I need your words your peace. If you manage to read this tho I doubt it never will. I just want to have peace in my soulmate,Depression
47518,47502,Meds doesn't work and I don't want to even try again at fixing my life because I'll just end up failing as always. Apparently my depression is so severe that not even the most potent medication can cure it I still feel as depressed as I would be if I didn't take it. I also don't even feel like trying to do anything anymore because I'm just gonna fail again for the millionth fucking time. It never goes away it never stops.,Depression
26693,26713,This hurts my soul because I just finished silently crying.. I have severe ptsd affiliated with cannabis using that term because any other will just mess me up again and since I have people that will wonder why and why I have a hatred to it.. a couple years ago my sister had just started and was using a vape that had cbd or thc in it. Her and her bf were taking turns using it and me being stupid I asked to take a hit from it the feeling it gave me was strange i coughed a lot and made me woozy. I made the mistake of asking for another I only got for like a second and I erupted into coughing my ass off I coughed all the air in my lungs out multiple times felt like I was going to die either to my lungs collapsing or suffocating I managed to catch my breath after coughing it all out at least 3 times.. by then I had already been traumatized from fighting for my life for a good 5 minutes.. I felt lightheaded my heart was racing and I was breathing extremely fast. I do not remember the high at all because of what happened. Ever since that day I have gotten slightly better in talking about it does not hurt anymore but triggers include smell and watching as someone does it. I did not watch my sister do it today but the smell soon as it hit me I rushed outside holding my breath until then. Went to my car and silently felt everything again I just on a strong face for my sister when she asked me if I was okay. She went inside after a few minutes. And I just silently started crying because I remember everything about that day fighting fear everything.. kept in mind I am really good at holding myself back acting stronger than I actually am. Anyways thanks for listening to me.. I cannot speak right now but I am better .. Ptsd and silent tears today..,Depression
19959,19979,i have not felt this feeling in my chest of sadness since probably late 2020. i do not know why its back. once i accept the fact that i am meaningless i am replaceable and that i am not important i will be able to move on with life and stop overthinking. i do not know what is wrong with me. i went on a trip recently and i had fun but i cannot remember what i felt when i was there. i only have this heavy feeling in my chest. when i try to remember the trip it seems like it was not actually me that went. or it seems like I am watching me live it again like a dream but i never did. and i do not know if i was happy or sad then because all i feel now is sadness. i do not know how to explain it. but its making me feel weird. like I am living but watching myself from the inside sometimes. like sometimes i will laugh or react to something but its not me reacting. its a reflex. i still feel empty inside. and my mind is watching from the inside asking why did i laugh its driving me insane I am over it,Depression
20344,20364,I lost a lot of things due to my mental illnesses. But this is probably the best thing that I have lost. I got a 10 month old puppy a gorgeous labrador pitbull mix. We had her for around a month. She made me smile and giggle all the time. She felt like the only friend I had close to me. Someone that I could hug and cuddle with. I even tried to take of her leash at the dog park the 2nd day we got her and she kept running back to me looking for me always. But she was a puppy and a big one around 25 kgs. So she made a lot of damages chewed a lot of shoes and it took her a while to learn to pee outside. Due to low energy and loss of appetite I struggled to take her for walks except for maybe once a day and just let her outside in the yard when she needed to go.. I barely take care of myself so taking care of all the mess she kept making was not something I could do. My family got frustrated with the situation and decided to gove her away. They said I did not try hard enough. Its all my fault that she left. I hate myself. I miss her so much. But hey at least I can cry have not been able to for a while. I do not have anyone else to be here for me. I just need a hug. Stupid rant from a stupid person over. I lost probably the greatest dog because of my incapability,Depression
20858,20878,I have Instagram Twitter and this thing. Although it can be a great distraction sometimes when I am feeling low it can make it worse. But not in the sense of being jealous of others and their happy life more so in the sense of watching all the chaos of the world and how everyone treats each other. When I am depressed this feels highlighted. Maybe that sounds stupid idk. This happen to anyone else? Social media sometimes makes things feel worse,Depression
7611,7631,Last week I tested positive for covid for the first time.Ever since then my whole family is now positive. I do not even know how I got it or if I am the one who infected them but I just do not care at this point.I was doing so well. I was spending time with my friends and family outdoors with masks when needed. I had a workout routine and was feeling so confident in myself. I was going to therapy every week. Practicing self care. Exploring my spirituality.Then this happens. I am in constant pain no energy my lungs burn when I breathe. I cannot sleep. I cannot do weightlifting and my body dysmorphia is back full force. I cannot be around my loved ones. I cannot go to therapy. I cannot read or draw or focus on my hobbies because of the disorientation. I cried more this week than I have in months. I do not want to eat or move or exist. I feel immeasurable guilt for possibly bringing this home.Why is it every time I am doing better life gives me a big old middle finger up the ass? Am I destined to be miserable? I wish I could just die. Depression and Covid19,Depression
7767,7787,Like I do not want this life I do not want to exist anymore. I do not appreciate life and I am not grateful and a big fuck you to all you positivity only cunts who go around telling others to love life and be appreciative fuck you fuck you fuck you. I wish I could just die in my fucking sleep I do not want to live anymore but I also do not want to kill myself. Can I please just stop existing omg.

20568,20588,I have been useless my entire life whatever I say would just offend someone or make me look stupid I live in a third world country with no way to get out I will die in this same town. I will never make a big enough impact on anyone ever. All I have done is make people upset everytime i open my mouth. I just want to stop talking and stop thinking no interactions with anyone. I have friends I have a loving family. I am not even sure if I am depressed or am i just faking it. I am so fucking useless that I cannot even write a single paragraph properly capturing my feelings. I just want some interaction. I do not know why maybe I am just a lil shit who fakes his depression for attention. I just want to stay silent,Depression

26927,26947,Once you get disillusioned about life. you are not longer able to believe in having relationship that is not based on some superficial. Once happy hormones disappear and you are not longer young and pretty or you no longer enjoy the hobby that you both shared problems start brewing. Family for me is an empty word. Most of my jobs sucked big time. I no longer believe in love. You have to fight with everyone and pretend to be someone else. At work you need to professional when all you want to do is scream and leave that place immediately. While socializng you need to be bubbly and talkative even tho you are fucking introvert and prefer to listen. While driving you need to avoid bullies that have no regards for others. I am tired. Life is dull,Depression
20674,20694,I have been off medication for a while now. have not seen the psychiatrist and my bank may actually be thanking me for this. My mental health I am not quite sure since the more recent sessions have not been effectiveThere are days like today that I just feel off. That I feel down. I knew today was going to be a stressful workday and I wanted to tackle it head on but I just could not for some reason. I was filled with so much stress and anxiety over a deliverable earlier. Even now I am dreading future devlierables and I am so close to breaking down. I am incredibly tired. I just want a break from everything. I want to close my eyes at night fall asleep and wake up to a peaceful morning that will eventually lead to a peaceful evening.I crave for peace so much. Why cannot I have it? I want a break from everything.,Depression
22307,22327,there were rules to which obeyed standarts...Living in a charade thy was all. No real purpose can save you when you are mentally ill. I have OCD non responsive to meds. Everday I lose a part of my identity. Constant fight beetween two spheres of my brain. I was a star dust and I am ready and fulfilled in life to go back to where everthing started. I love my friend Yamur which is a mix of passion and love and charity. I can do anything for her if I had been healthy enough.I love my family too they matter a lot. But I can not tolerate my daily melancholic suicidal depression and obsessions just for the sake of them. The world has no rules on grand scale no justice no purpose. we have to distract our mind and create and illusion each second just to forget we exist. Yes we exist and this must be a bad joke. We are walking to the eventual death of us each day. Some of us only suffer while some of us can be happy in their distraction.For example the girl I loved we are texting only Ilove her so much without even seeing her face and voice. Yet I know she will never meet with me nor can I touch her ever. On top of that void calls me. I always dreamt of jumping from bosphurus bridge. Before jumping I ll look to mu childhood photos family photos and the photos of the girl I deeply fell love in. I do not want to lose and tarnish this love. Call me coward probably right. Anyway sleeping pills and jumping from Bosphurus to crystsl blue current will be my choice. Maybe the only time I would be free just before dying. Such a misery. I will become a part of eternal silence until maybe I revorn again after for example another Big Bang. or maybe never who knows maybe we a simulation of a 4th grade student out of our real . And some day our universr will cease to exist to no avail.I want to thanks to reddit which is full of nice and also weird people. people who shows their true selves.I love you Yamur and it ll be forever.And my family do not morn after me for finally am I free.In another life brothers bye. My Suicide Note was just a passenger,Depression

22672,22692,Just wondering if there is any link to the two of them and does anybody else here have this too? I have had depression for ages but what I noticed is how I can listen to the same song over and over again not get sick it. Also rewatching certain tv episodes over and over again to the point where I am questioning my own sanity. Depression causing obsessions?,Depression
24079,24099,I guess I have always felt like this. Ever since I can remember I get random outbursts of wanting having to get out of the place I am in. I have moved so many times I have lost count yet no place ever feels like home. The few people who have felt like that I drive away with my sadness. And the ones who stick around only seem to hurt me. I turned 27 this year and I feel more lost than I ever have. I keep quitting jobs and isolating myself pushing people away seem to be the only hobbies I am consistent with. Would therapy help at this point? I have tried that so many times. Antidepressants make me more depressed and keeping sober is the only thing keeping me sane at this point bc self medicating turns into escapism real quick for me. I have reached out to close friends and family as well but all I get is the pep talk. Only temporary it will get better just a phase that happens to everyone every once in a whileThe thing is I know I am not special. I know there is so many people out there who have it worse. Just thinking about it sends me through a guilty black hole of self pity and contempt for my lack of control over my own emotions. When will I stop feeling this emptiness? Does it ever really get better? I just feel a perpetual state of time passing by me while I watch myself in third person and feeling like a spectator of my own life. I feel out of place everywhere I go,Depression
19204,19224,What was I even thinking? That I could actually end myself when ever I want to? Do I regret spending the late night vommitting stomac accids and pills all over the floor? Yes.

Disapointed and lightheaded,Depression
26521,26541,I am sorta venting but Its a feeling of emptiness as far as I remember I have always been this way never knew what i wanted in life and was never really sure of what and who i am just going from place to place my reaction to most things has always been i do not know I do not know why I am thinking about this now but i think maybe its part of the reason why I have been depressed since ninth grade. How do you deal with this?,Depression
14571,14591,HelpI had thoughts of cutting for about a week. I read posts I looked at the warnings it did not stop me. I have been cutting for 2 days now and I cannot stop.

I am using razors and cutting the outside of my thigh... I need someone to talk to,Depression
19077,19097,Recently I upped my medication and I am hoping to find ways to feel better. Everyone says working out is a great way to do so. However I work 7 Days a week 10 hours a day outside.

18999,19019,In March after a year of rejections I finally got my dream job and I was happier than ever. Everything was going well but then I lost a few members of my family and took a week off as a result. My job acted supportive at the time so I did not think this would affect anything. Less than two weeks ago I moved to the city where the job is based cementing this new stage in my life.And today I went into the office just to discover that they are not passing my probation and are terminating my employment immediately.This came as such a shock to me as there had been no mention of my performance in the past outside of when I was struggling because of bereavement. So it seems like they have this front that they are supportive of people with mental health issues but in reality they do not want to deal with people who have them.I am so broken and I do not know what to do. I worked so hard to get this job after the pandemic ruined my life and I cannot even get this right? My mental health always finds a way to fuck up every good thing in my life and now I am alone in a new city with no job.All the healing I have done over the last couple of months bc of my bereavement has just disappeared and I am back at square one. I feel like my life will never be good and Id rather be dead. I cannot take this anymore bc I am a disgusting failure. I lost my dream job after working so hard for it and I want to die,Depression

8091,8111,Earlier today I was thinking how I might just be able to do this. Get feeling better and stay feeling better. It would mean I could stop bothering a couple of people that I turn to for support.This evening I found out one of them has COVID and the other is getting tested tomorrow.I will gladly have my depression return nonstop if it means they are both okay. Please let them get better. I would give my life for them to have more time together. It is selfish of me to get feeling better,Depression
18854,18874,I have been struggling with depression for at least 7 years now and recently got professionally diagnosed by a psychiatrist which was scary and infuriating.This whole year was a shitshow my grandma who raised me for 12 of my childhood died dad got into the hospital 3 times my whole family got sick... Moved out from my parents' house and started living alone in the city. We had uni online only and I could not go out much almost all year there were periods where I did not talk to anyone for weeks. All of my routines went to shit and when the depression episode hit it lasted more than the usual couple of weeks12 months 11 fucking months and counting. There were periods where I could not do anything just selfmedicated cried or felt nothing for months and tried to distract myself.This is a huge problem since I am in medical school 2nd year and have to study a lot. I could compensate for those depressive episodes in high school but not in uni. I hate to admit I have a problem outside of my control so for a long time I was saying to myself that I am a lazy stupid undisciplined bitch and should work harder. So I pushed myself tried every technique routine schedule under the sun studied all day and it got so much worse. And despite being close to killing myself 2 times in the past having almost all of the symptoms of depression I still did not believe I had a mental illness. Because I am so much better than that right? I am not an emotional person so how could I have a mood disorder. I used to have generalized anxiety and panic disorder from when I was 6 until I was about 17 and got over them by myself so I thought I can get over this alone too.Only when I started being suicidal like I did not only not want to live but thought that killing myself eventually is inevitable since I am never going to become better really wanted to do it I thought of asking for help. Called a couple of therapists but they were either unavailable or straight up bailed on me. Cut myself drank my cool Russian vodka straight from the bottle smoked a pack of Malboros and decided to suck it up at least after my exams were over. Grandma died a week before the 1st one and I had to console my family take care of the house and support my mom and dad emotionally. All while trying to cover 260 topics from anatomy in 10 days. For this exam and the next ones I was way too depressed to study but studied anyway with my 0 energy 0 concentration and 100 motivation. Somewhere between the exams I kind of lost it and cut myself again with my pocket knife and it took me 2 days to clean up the mess since I did not have bandages and just made the bathroom and hall look like a murder scene. Slept a lot. My average each semester in the beginning of the depression and before it was all As and now it dropped to a fucking C. So I decided to be stubborn and try to get help again and found a psychiatrist who had a lot of recommendations and good reviews. Started Zoloft. Since then I am either sleeping having debilitating migraines or crying because of how helpless I feel. Since the year is over and I am on summer break my friends are calling me to go out I got asked out on a few dates I have to start work at the hospital. I am so fucking angry man. it is so hard to make myself do any of this I am extremely privileged and worked my ass off to be where I am....only to not feel any joy in life and want to disappear. I have parents who love me I have amazing friends I got into my first choice medical school to study medicine I get to live alone I have so many opportunities in front of me and no real problems to worry about and yet I am so fucking weak and pathetic that I cannot enjoy any of it. My brain is bad and I do not know why the only explanation I was given is that my serotonin levels were low it was a chemical imbalance etc. I want to be so much better as a friend as a daughter as a doctor in training but I am what I do and everything I do now is a huge fucking disappointment to everyone. I feel like a fly jamming itself into a window trying to get out. It would be so funny if it was not devastating. All of my personality ambitions drive enthusiasm energy pleasure go away because a couple of neurotransmitters are not doing their jobs. And I cannot fix it with hard work cannot get over it through willpower and telling myself I suck cannot ignore it. I miss feeling alive and wanting to be. Now I feel like an absence of a person a puppet to my shitty brain who is just trying to minimize damage.Wrote this whole thing to avoid cutting myself again since I have no mop. Was forced to tell my father I have depression over the phone at that he was shocked felt bad and was so supportive in the end. Showing any kind of vulnerability especially in front of my dad makes me want to break every bone in my body afterward Anyway promised him and myself that I am going to be better and felt so bad about it. How can I make promises about things I cannot really control? What if the Zoloft does not help all I get is the side effects and I continue being more and more depressed? I hate that I cannot trust myself and have to hope and believe that things will get better eventually. I feel so trapped directionless alone and tired and I have no right to feel like this. Rant I hate myself but this time I cannot use it as fuel in any meaningful way TW selfharm suicide?,Depression

18073,18093,TLDR Wean off effexor xr 75mg myself or cold turkey?I have been on paxileffexor xr 75mg for a couple of years now. I feel like its done its job. I am no longer depressed for months at a time. Just some bad days that are few and far between. I have a job that I like for the most part retail. I am just sorta neutral on everything. I do not have super lows or super highs just blah. I feel like that its not giving anymore benefits. Just major headaches if i miss a dose. For the past year since before COVID started to wonder trying to see how life is without it since I have changed the worlds changed so much since I started taking it.I really dislike my current doctor I only go to him since he is the same doc as my dad and that he is close. Today I called him to see if I can try stopping. He did not suggest it since he said that it could take 6 weeks to see any effects. And that trying to go back on it if I decide I need it is bad.I asked if he was going to wean me off or just make me quit cold turkey. He said that I should just stop cold turkey. Now I know that when I miss a dose or two I get bad headachesbrain zaps become really irritable and get sick. So him saying cold turkey is fine makes me feel really scared. I have read up on other peoples posts that effexor xr is the worst to stop cold.I was wondering if I could either A break the few pills I have left and self wean or B try to find another doctor as a new primary care physician second opinion.Any advice is greatly apricated.

11282,11302,I 20f just got diagnosed with anxiety and depression mainly because I finally went to my doctor about it. After my initial screening I was diagnosed put on medicine and referred to a therapist. I am happy I finally got the help I needed since I have been dealing with this for majority of my life however after two weeks of seeing my therapist she told me I was emotionally abused by my mother. I always had a feeling I was but I guess it was a shocker to hear it from someone other than my brother. Now my therapist wants me to write about my childhood and everything I remember about it. This is terrifying to me because I normalized everything I was dealing with and now I realize that what I went through was not normal at all. I guess I am just scared to relive everything and realize how much I actually went through. If you have any tips please let me know. I just got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I have mixed feelings,Depression
12577,12597,i have been crying myself to sleep for like the past month I have found that it really helps me fall asleep. it was mostly just overthinking and imagining scenarios in my head that made me upset and made me cry. i kind of feel like it is spiralling into something bigger though i find myself upset during the day with low mood and get upset over little things that would not affect me that much before. i feel like this is stemming from me crying myself to sleep every night and want to find alternatives. i did not think too much of it initially as i did not think it was that big of a deal it was kind of like something that helped me fall asleep and sleep better. id appreciate some advice on how to deal with this and alternatives i can incorporate to help me fall asleep without crying and how i can deal with being easily upset and in a low mood during the day. crying myself to sleep need alternatives lol,Depression

20623,20643,I am 41. Not sure exactly how I got here but I honestly feel cursed by god or the universe or whatever forces are at work. I have felt depressed for about 25 years now. And before that as a child I felt different weird isolated and alienated. I was 18 before seeking real help when someone at my university asked me Have you ever considered killing yourself? and it occurred to me that that was not normal. I have been on most of the major antidepressants. I have been hospitalized twice. I have seen countless doctors therapists psychiatrists psychologists and still I am in the same place. I have reached out to TMS and Ketamine places but have not gotten anywhere. I have tinnitus and have taken a number of blows to the head throughout my life but never been sure if its related to the depression. I have a supportive family and even a great wife and I feel terrible for relying on them so much financially and emotionally while not being able to make progress. My main problem seems to be that I do not feel like I am a part of anything that is going on. I do not understand what is going on. I do not know what I am supposed to be doing. Everything seems wrong and all I see is chaos and confusion. I am honestly trying my best to survive and thrive but it just keeps getting worse. I went to college because I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. Now I barely even enjoy films or it feels like every idea has been done. I knew I could not network or assemble a crew or any of the necessary things I would have to do. The most I was ever able to do was to make wedding videos.and hire maybe 1 other person. I decided to stop doing that got a job editing short promos for TV shows which gave me a portfolio no one seems to care about. Worked for local government creating media before getting fired for voicing concerns about noise in the office because I am so sensitive. Then with no one hiring me I had to go back to driving which I have done ever since I was able to work. I used to think driving made me feel free and I could be alone with music podcasts and my thoughts but now I do not want to be alone with my thoughts because all I think about is killing myself all day. For two years I transported dead bodies which was super depressing. Now I work for FedEx and its hot noisy and extremely strenuous. Every time someone tries to help me with a job prospect it leads nowhere to the point where I do not even want to accept the help. I have been rejected from so many places that it seems I would be qualified for. I look for jobs all the time and they all look really bad or do not pay much. And the process takes so much time only to be rejected at the end. I want to quit my job but only have spotty gig work to fall back on. I feel like a failure and that I cannot contribute financially.I do feel gratitude for the things I have. I have tried journaling meditation yoga exercise and plenty of the other things people suggest you do. But my mind stays locked on past mistakes and cringey moments. I beat the shit out of myself all day everyday and cannot stop. I compare myself to others get jealous and get angry that I cannot be normal or successful. And it feels like I am getting dumber more forgetful and harder of hearing when I need to have all my faculties working as well as possible. It just seems I am getting older and my life gets more sad and embarrassing. I barely want to leave the house because I am sensitive to the horrible things I see or situations I might end up in.I do not know what to do anymore. I am scared of getting older and how it could possibly get even worse. I need help but I cannot seem to get it. Everything is out of reach. Everything seems impossible. I have tumbled down for a long time and see no way back up,Depression
47810,47793,I hate my life It feels like I repeat the same day every day. I have to take on everyones problems. I wake up and I hate my life I go to sleep hating my life. Hating myself feeling useless. I want to just pick up and go and even though I understand my depression will follow I feel like I need the opportunity to be in a new environment to learn more about myself and how to cope with how I feel. The repetitiveness is driving me deeper into a dark hole and I feel like I wont be able to get out. I want to just pick up and leave but my anxiety wont let me I need money I need a way to get around. I have a life here even though I dont even wanna be alive here. I just wanted to get this off my chest. When I tell the people around me I want to go back to my home country they tell me Im crazy and that I shouldnt.,Depression

I have a heavy itchy blanket on it is soothing in a way.I did eat last night chips and a battered sausage if I do not eat over a few days my family get funny with me. The last thing I need is that.I showered on Saturday I think? God that is gross I am gross for it. This constant self punishment. I have not taken my medication yet today every day I am finding it harder and harder to take. It sits on my bedside table as a near constant reminder of my inability to function.People keep telling me that going on the meds was the right thing seeking help was the right thing... In the ten years since these spirals begsn I have never felt this bad. This alone. This pathetic.there is football on today I am not interested but then you would know that. My friend wants me to go over to hers to watch it so I know I will shower today and be able to get out of my bed. Socialising helps me I say help it distracts me I can put on my mask the mask I wish was permanent. she is happy she is funny people like her.I have started to notice that I am loeing myself more and more when I drink. I blackout so early but sometimes I blackout when I am sober is it the meds?I wish this would just stop.No I am not going to try and end it again. I do not have the means too maybe I will get lucky and be hit by a car or stuck by lightning. Day 3 in the hole.,Depression

8599,8619,I have been through too much shit to list but the most important thing is I have binge eating disorder had numerous inpatient stays seeing therapy 2x per week currently zero changes that has gained me 70 pounds which makes me want to kill myself and I feel zero pleasure from literally anything and have not for years. I used heroin for 20 days straight no longer using to get my time without a binge tracker to 20 days and now today less than a week later even though just two hours ago I was convinced binge eating was a thing of the past I binged.

I do not even know what it feels like to be happy anymore or anything else that gives me happiness. I have given up on everything that I liked. I am just slogging through uni because I have to. I have no friends no emotional support and a boyfriend whom I am terrified of. I lie to him about being okay all the time because I know he will fight with me if I say why I am not doing well and it will end up ruining whatever time I spend with him which in turn will ruin my head even more. I want to die I just want to end it. I have been pulling it so far only because of my dog. he is the reason I have to live but nothing feels okay. This was not supposed to happen this was supposed to be the best time of our lives. I am 20f. I was bullied throughout my teenage years by school mates and before that my relatives.

24091,24111,I am a 35 year old Brazilian teacher and I cannot remember the last time I felt meaningful joy. I feel guilty by saying that because I have a nice family and a wonderful girlfriend and they love me and respect me so much but I feel like crap. I did therapy on and off for around 10 years I took medicine I tried meditation... I have dreams that remain that dreams. One of them is to write. I do not fantasize in becoming famous or anything but whenever I sit down to write after I read my production it just sucks so much. it is anguishing to attempt something and realize that you are not good enough for that. I know that something is require practice but I do not feel that all the effort is worth it because in the end I always come to the same conclusion I do not like life I think I never did. I think I have always looked for peace and happiness but I cannot find it anywhere not even inside of me. I just do not know what to decide end everything or accept that I will be forever unhappy until my natural non suicidal death. I think I just need someone neutral to talk because I cannot say these things to my family. Brazilians are too emotional sensitive and almost zero rational so it is be inevitable to hurt someone if I shared what I actually think. I simply cannot stand this place anymore.

23486,23506,I have suffered depression my entire life but from 2017 2020 I finally felt like I had conquered it. Then COVID hit and I had to isolate. I had to work from home and it felt like I lost my life.Now that vaccines are available and things are starting to return to some normalcy I just cannot snap out of the COVID depression I went into. I am completely unable to function at work and am getting into trouble. I have lost all my confidence and desire to do anything other than sleep.My previous depressions were always drug related. Either taking my meds incorrectly or dabbling in drugs that threw me overboard. This time around there are no drugs. I am doing everything I can to be healthy. Good diet. Try to get good sleep. Tons of exercise. But nothing is snapping me out of it.Maybe it is the WFH thing that has me down. As much as I hate commuting to work I just cannot seem to focus or think anymore. Never had that issue in the office.My workplace is now putting things on me that I cannot handle. I am so stressed Constantly and have no confidence nor desire to do any of the work. I want to just give my 2 weeks and walk away but I am terrified I will not find another job since my qualifications have always been lacking. But how much longer can I take the stress? At some point I am going to be driven over the edge. Whether that be next week or 3 months from now. But I am too scared to look for another job with how I am feeling. What will be different anywhere else? My career is a challenging one and I do not feel up for the challenge anymore. I do not know if it is just COVID or if I have just changed as a person. Is it just a matter of going back into work and feeling like a functional member of society again? Does anyone else feel this way? COVID depression has made me unable to function. Anyone else experience this?,Depression
9429,9449,I have struggled with depression on and off throughout the years. Recently for the last 4 months I have been watching myself go down a slippery slope I see what I am doing I hear what I am doing but I do not stop myself . Its more morally compromising than anything . I want to be a good person I want to feel like me or be the me I know I can be . I do not stop myself from falling further and further down the rabbit hole I just sort of watch myself from outside my body as it happens . I get up every morning and go to work and then after work I just collapse and ball up and just sit there for hours not doing anything . I get up the next morning and do the same thing so at least I have a routine . I want advice on how to feel for things motivating myself to do things for me not relying on others to make me feel okay. I work 6 days a week so its hard to find a therapist with my schedule is there any advice that I can get to help me get on the right track to feeling again? I appreciate everyone is input Am I M22 depressed or just empty?,Depression
13665,13685,I keep looking back about 2 years ago and yearn to be that version of myself. I was happy thriving I got excited about things and now I am just floating. I do not feel right. I cannot pinpoint a specific thing that happened that made me this way. I think it was all very gradual. Maybe COVID made it worse? My parents came to visit me recently I have not seen them in a year. Were very close and I was not excited. I had to fake it but all the while I was sitting there like meh. I do not get rushes of adrenaline I do not laugh until I cry I do not feel butterflies I really just do not feel much except that I am just here and existing. What is wrong with me? I have lost myself and I want to find me again,Depression
20266,20286,I have been digging myself into a hole for like 10 years. Now I either have to battle my way out through 10 years worth of shit on me while getting older and it getting harder or I can just go. Like cmon. Which option is the more reasonable one? This is absolutely futile,Depression
9433,9453,Some background info firstOur relationship has been going on for about 3 months now. Although that is not a long time we have already managed to build a really strong bond and our relationship has progressed pretty fast.I just recently graduated and am now looking forward to studying at an university.My boyfriend has everything going for him as well. He just recently got his own amazing apartment he has a well paid and stable job and a supportive family. I live within a short distance away from him with my mom.Everything was going really well at first and within the first month of us dating he told me about his struggle with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. In 2020 a lot went wrong and he was really close to ending his life. He names his mother as the only reason he did not do it he did not want her to go through the pain of losing her only child. He already went through therapy twice that year which did not help. Taking any kind of pills is not an option for him. When we met he was having a good phase but during the past few weeks things have been getting worse and worse. Some days are really good others really really bad. I have struggled with mental health issues myself so I can relate to the feelings he is having to some degree. But his depression is unlike anything I have ever witnessed.When he is having a bad day and I am with him we barely talk and there is a lot of tension. He tries not to let it out on me which works most of the time.But it still hurts me to see him in so much pain.To listen to the person you love talking about suicide is a feeling unlike any other. I feel like I am not able to do anything about it.We often talk about the things that are bothering him. he is just convinced that there is no meaning to life and everything is already going downhill for humanity because of climate change and neverending waves of corona.These are just a few of his reasonsI know I cannot fix his depression or really do anything about the issues that are bothering him but I still feel so useless and hopeless.I truly love him and want to be a supportive girlfriend. it is not an option for me to leave him even tho this whole thing is really testing my beliefs and draining my own mental health. I am incredibly scared of him making a wrong decision and I honestly think he is very close to that.Has anyone had similar experiences with loved ones that are struggling with depression?Is there any way I can help more effectively besides just being supportive listening being there for him...If anyone has read this far thank you and I hope that there are people that are able to give me some good adviceEnglish is not my first language so please excuse any mistakes or weird phrasing I W18 am scared of my boyfriend M20 committing sucide,Depression
16874,16894,Since I was eleven maybe younger I have dealt with odd crying spells a lack of motivation an ache in my chest when I cry so badly it feels like a hammer was thrown into my sternum a habit of self destruction and sometimes a sense of selfishness so intense I am amazed I still have a family to hug.As I have gotten older things have gotten easier in some aspectsmore difficult in others. I have always felt safe when I sleep though. When I sleep I do not have to deal with the emotional dysfunction brought by my ADHD which if I had not been diagnosed and medicated I am not sure if Id still be here nor do I have to deal with other people. I love my family and I love my boyfriend but I feel bad for existing as I am sometimes.I do not like having sad thoughts pop into my head. I do not enjoy crying for hours in my car at 6AM. I have never liked the headache I get after I cry for so long and get it all out. Sadness is such a bother.I still do not quite have a grasp on how I am going to manage once I am living on my own or I do not have insurance but I know that thinking about it for too long can trigger the crying and freaking out. I know that thinking about the future too intensely as a whole can trigger the crying and freaking out. I do not want to cry and freak out anymore. I wish I had been born into wealth so often. And I know that the economic side of things is such a root because for what MUST be a majority of the population. This can make me cry and freak out too thinking about how unfair it all is.In the 10 years I have been feeling this way I still do not know what the whole lesson is supposed to be. I may never learn the lesson. Maybe I am the lesson to everyone else? Sounds kind of dumb tho.I do not want to be sad. I want to be happy. I want to laugh from my belly when I watch TV and I want to be able to listen to more music and feel comfortable singing. I want to live in my own place and fill it with plants. I might want to have kids some day and end the generational trauma once and for all. I write about my future to keep myself hopeful in the present. I do not. Want. To. Be. Alone.Thanks for letting me vent. Hah. I have had Major Depressive Disorder for 10 years.,Depression
12279,12299,I am done. Why is it so hard to take your life? I have no joy in anything or anyone. My lovers see me as a fucking joke. And I am just pawn to my parents. I am never happy anymore and I all I do is think awful fucking things. Id be dead now if o was not such a fucking pussy. Why?,Depression
27090,27110,I have felt like this for a while however only recently realised shit maybe I am depressed. I suppose its just not a nice realisation to make. there is this constant gnawing at my chest not quite a pain but a presence that pushing on my chest with my worst days life being unbearable agony and pain. I have got good friends and I am happy that for the most part I can enjoy my time with them despite that cavity in my chest being a constant present but as time goes on I notice I am experiencing increased highs and lows. Its bizarre but I have been the happiest I have been in a while despite being depressed I suspect for a year or two now singing with these friends a week or two ago nothing special but I was ecstatic for a week and then all of a sudden I became the most depressed I have ever been. It also somewhat scares me that I think my friends noticed this although I understand the irrationality of this fear. I am not in as deep as a low now anymore hence which I am on reddit looking for help I suppose but I do not really know if or indeed how long I will yoyo like that. I am sure it does not help for my moods that I am basically starving myself right now but that is what I am doing regardless. I am very conscious of my wrong actions and yet I do them anyway and I do not know why. Also I think about killing myself quite a bit what would other people think how would I do it but that being said I think its more of a thought experiment than me genuinely being suicidal. I do not really know what this most is other than me admitting to myself that I am indeed depressed. Time to go out and look for meaningless sex I suppose. Jokes aside thanks for the platform and I appreciate any antidotes or advice you have. I have realised I am probably depressedrant.,Depression
15141,15161,Honest question here I want to admit to this but I do not want my life to go to shit. I have bottled my emotions for years now and just need to get some extra help by admitting my darkest thoughts. Will I be able to do my normal life? What happens after you admit to suicidal thought?,Depression
25469,25489,they drag me along everywhere just so i can sit and watch them talk to each other and every once in awhile will ask me the most basic questions ever like so how you feeling? so what do you think? god people make me feel so unimportant i hate my life and myself how did people get to the point of treating me like this? i thought i made it clear to people in my family that its HARD for me to bring myself into conversations but i guess people can never understand how hard it is. maybe they would understand more if they knew how much depression affects you and everything you do because that is why its gotten worse for me but no one seems to take that possibility into consideration ever. and they leave me out while i hate my life wishing it could be easy for me too. and i can tell they do not want to invite me but do anyway to seem nice or something. though they act two faced and extra nice to me in public like I am a token depressed person or something. just because its hard for me and i cannot interact and i close myself off from everyone when they are talking in a group and i do that because i cannot keep up with what they are talking about and have no knowledge about anything because I have isolated myself because of my depression for SO LONG that i cannot socialize nor look people in the eyes nor function anymore. anyway people in my family should know i have a hard time with talking and functioning now because i even cry in public but they probably call it me being attention seeking and twist it but oh well! everyone in my life just feels two faced towards me with fake niceness but will just talk down on me when they thing I am not hearing instead of addressing how i feel with ME. just tired of people having problems with people but never addressing anything everything in my life is a illusion. my family treats me like a liability and like i cannot understand anything,Depression
24406,24426,it is really easy I have a lot of love to give but none to myself. If I do not love another it will be wasted. So I spend it all on others so maybe they will love me back and in turn I will feel loved. I cannot do it I have tried this self love business. Self love is not easy as I have never been loved not by the ones that were suppose to love me. They sparked this fire of self hate in me when I was a young child. Their hurtful words have become my own. It is not their voices I hear anymore but my mine god she is a bitch a right fucking cow. Loud and mean always got something smart to say. I tried saying something nice to myself but it sounds strange and really fake. So I am on rollercoaster of always healing but never healing. The good days are scarce and the bad days feel like a long winter night and I am locked out of the house. I feel so alone in this. I close my eyes and think if bear it all if I hold on for a little longer maybe I will be saved. Maybe who knows I will be among the lucky ones who is plucked from the crowd by a saviour. Oh god even writing that did not make me believe it. How can you truly love someone else if you cannot even love yourself?,Depression
23310,23330,oh my god I am literally so tired. why cannot I be happy or just feel anything other than sad or numbness. Sometimes I wonder if Ill end up alone because I just do not have the motivation to do anything anymore. I do not even want to say hi to my family anymore. I do not want to do anything anymore. I do not even want to be here anymore. I am just tired of existing I am so fatigued,Depression
38662,38659,i am having a hard time nailing down whether i am truly experiencing ocd or anxiety or both amp x 00b doe anyone have any experience with one or both that can chime in,Depression

15989,16009,Every day is just an overwhelming flood of the same terrible things happening over and over again but it gets worse every day. It would be nice to just end it before it gets any worse. Sometimes I resent my family and friends. If they did not care about me I could kill myself without hurting anyone.,Depression
9720,9740,I do not see a point to anything anymore. I believe I have identified it as apathy. But as far as I can rationalize it I exist on this planet to live for an arbitrary reason and then die. Full stop. I cannot find meaning I have been trying so fucking hard but I just cannot. I have everything I could want In life but I find joy in none of it. I used to love gaming and travelling. As of the past couple years I have not felt excited for either in any capacity. I have not felt anger happiness or sadness in what feels like a lifetime. All I am experiencing is boredom and apathy. I am not even sure if what I am experiencing is depression but from what I can tell its at least a form of it. I have been to therapists and psychologists I have tried CBT. None of it has worked. I am trying to avoid antidepressants but I hate the sound of the side effects especially the ones related to sex. Sex is one of the last things that distracts me from what I am experiencing although I am afraid I am developing an addiction to it. I am not even suicidal. I just feel so jaded and tired of living. But I do not see a way out. Being dead seems worse but I do not know where to go from here. I am a conventionally attractive young college student who is been in a stable relationship for 5 years with a gorgeous amazing girl. And I am absolutely depressed beyond reason.,Depression
7529,7549,I have posted here before. My problems are pretty big and out of people's hands regarding depressionanxiety. My 5 year old daughter got taken away from me four months ago. For no good reason at all. I was a great father. I raised her for 4 and a half years 56 days a week. It crushed me when she was taken away. With my depression I have been living the last four months like a apathetic hobo. Not caring about anything. Getting worse and worse. I make songs. Alot of it is pissed off and dark. it is the only thing that got me through.I got a call today from law firm and she told me that the judge granted me full custody. I pick her up this Saturday. With cops probably. I have a full band now. Instead of me being solo.I have to clean up.my act now. Clean my room it is horrible Clean myself up. My sister said she would help. Good things do happen. You just have to not give up and cannot let depression win Rage on! I have an inspiring story,Depression

19616,19636,What triggered meToday I found out that the father of my ex best friends died. I was shocked and sad even tho I am not friends with them anymore I still feel bad for them. In the last few months I thought about what would I do if something happened to my parentswell probably die right after. The reality hit me like a truck with the death of their father which showed me the reality. I am basically living for my parents this would be terrifying to me because besides them no one cares about me and I do not have anyone else who I care about. I am now 18 years old and horrified of life the main thing why is because I cannot live with myself. I just hate myself so much that I cannot participate in any hobbies or do stuff I need to do to live a good life I just feel empty but also guilty because not everyone has privileges that I do. I do not want to be myself I never wanted to be. I am a MDDer because of that I do not live in the real world but escape into my fantasies. Instead of doing this shit which does not do anything for anyone I should sacrifice myself for others go work and be helpful maybe not like Ghandi or mother Teresa but a similar kind of helpful. I am not going to live for myself I do not want a familyhusbandwife kids partners and friendsI have to live for othersthe general society someone has to Why I hate myselfMy monolog is not structured I jumped from one thought to anotherit is long and probably not worth your time but here it goes I hate how empty I am how I always say the wrong things and always care about the wrong people. I have managed to make people hate me who actually liked me in the beginning. There is no such thing in me that I would call The self I do not even have a persona social mask. I am not a person just a vessel filled with contradicting emotions I am empty without an identity even tho I have searched for it my whole teenage life. I never had ambitions nor future plans besides killing myself when I am 18 In my dreams I did have ideas for the future but I saw them as unreachable and gaved them up leaving them in my head instead of making them reality .. well technically I am dead inside now. I cannot cry or shout at someone else but I was always the one who was shouted at they were right I am a piece of shit I am not going to lie and pretend otherwise but it still hurts because I am trying to be good but always do something wrongI am so fucking stupid and pathetic I am a bad person naturally and suck at even being a decent person. I felt so guilty because of my behaviour that I did not went to school for about 6 months made a lot of trouble etc. and all that just so I could punish myself and provoke myself to finally attempt suicide. Obviously no one knows that and they also do not care. You know what is also fucking gross about meits going to be embarrassing but in my teenage years 121617 I was unhealthy obsessed with love. I am not a person that has a lot of crushes I have had just a few three to be more specific. I hate myself for that but my obsessive behaviour was disgusting and embarrassing. Basically I always had a long crush on someone the longest was for about three years. Instead of doing what most do going to your crush after idk one month asking them out or befriending them I stalked them on social media etc. which seems fine to most but I also tried to meet this person in town and purposefully went where I thought they might be. Next to that I was in a delsuion that this person will rescue me. You see shit like that in skins as example where the infamous effy had two guys trying to help her and rescue her. I was not inspired by movies or shows its more like that this unhealthy attachment stamps from everyone hating or ignoring me that is why I assumed that this person could save me from my normal life. This particular person was the only one who cared even tho I was not friends with them. Heck my friends cared less about me than this person who seemed genuinely concerned about me. I did not like the person at first and did not even bother to be friendly with them but after seeing how they cared I could not resist and developed feelings I started to crave for this persons attention and love. I was and partly still am to some extend obsessed with my emotions which made makes me behave like an narcissist maybe I am one. My emotions ruled my life nothing mattered but this person because in my eyes I loved them this love filled the void that my self hatred created. I wanted so badly that they rescue me from this life. that is where my obsession came from. I hate my personality and I also happened to be ugly and dumb lol such a waste of air. Yes I am a plain Jane I hope I will look better because even tho I am empty inside but if my vessel ever becomes pretty than people will not annoy menegative harrassment like bullying anymore. And the dumb part is self explanatory. There is a lot more but I am way too lazy to write that down now I will edit this post if something new comes to my mind.btw . I am so sorry for my English I am not a native speakeredit typos Vent I hate myself I take any kind,Depression
13826,13846,Something weird happened. Maybe this helps someone.I was meditating and realized that I am fighting something. Myself. I realized I was subconsciously pushing to not feel anything and I want to avoid discomfort. I constantly am bullying myself. So what did I do?I said I am tired of this shit and accepted all the uncomfortable dark feelings and they just flowed. They were intense but after the waves were no longer there I felt way better. It did not happen all in one go but it definitely was a change and that is something. Progress is progress.Just smoked a bowl and am going into a voluntary anxiety session. I am determined to beat the shit out of depression. Had a breakthrough,Depression
27211,27231,No matter how many connections I make I can never break the barrier and find someone I actually feel connected too.. ampx200BI feel like no one on this planet understands me. All I really want is to give and reciprocate all the love I hold in my life. ampx200BI cannot make friends.. and every man I meet just wants to hook up. I have so much pure kindness in my heart and no one to give it to. I think that is why I love animals... ampx200BI am drunk and very depressed. My meds help suppress it a bit but my life is very wrong.. I was not mean to be so alone. No one is. There are so many people around me and I cannot find someone who gets me??? Life feels like a ghostdown,Depression
37935,37932,i ve never been good at talking to people about how i m doing and most of the time i ll just tell everyone i m fine and move on i have a very close friend and they re the only person i ve ever felt comfortable talking to i trust them with absolutely everything and we ve helped each other through so much a week ago or so they told me thing were changing and they ve sort of left we barely talk anymore and they told me they re still gon na be here for me but i really just don t feel it anymore it could just be my head making it seem a lot worse than it actually is but it really feel like they don t care at all anymore like they used to and it seems like they just don t even wan na talk to me anymore it hurt a lot to think that i used to always text them or something when thing were bad just so i could have someone to talk to but now i don t really have that anymore and i don t know what happened anyways ig no one s got ta respond but i just needed somewhere where i could say this,Depression
26594,26614,i turn the music up so loud that i feel it vibrate in my chest filling the spot in my heart where you once were. so loud,Depression
14871,14891,I just cannot live my life anymore. Every day I struggle just trying to make it through living for another day. I will addictively lose myself in fiction so that I can forget I exist in reality. I binge watch shows and play video games for 10 hours straight get little sleep and binge eat snacks. Then when I inevitably have to take a break I feel an insurmountable wave of depression and misery hit me. I hate remembering I exist in reality. I hate becoming aware of my meaningless worthless disgusting ugly horrible self. Being reminded I am complete garbage and not deserving of anything I have or desire. Then it gets so bad that I feel like I need to finally do something to snap out of it. I have to take charge of my life again.So I try. I practically kill myself working incredibly hard to push through my anxiety and fear and panic trying to talk to people trying to become social trying to find new hobbies trying to go to school and trying to find jobs living healthy going to therapy... and all it does is make things worse. I do not feel any sense of relief I just find new things to stress about new things to make me feel unloved worthless and empty.So I retreat from all of them avoid them and shut them all away. And I go back to trying to numb my mind. Trying to forget I am even real. I sleep all day never getting out of bed refusing to exercise refusing to cook refusing to clean my house just wanting to forget I am even real. I do not know why I am even still around anymore to be honest.I do not even feel like I have the right to talk about depression compared to people who actually suffer through it. I am just a brat a spoiled pretentious entitled fucker. The only reason I am depressed is because I am almost 30 years old and have never been able to experience having a girlfriend. Ever since I hit puberty more than 15 years ago it is the only thing that is been on my mind. it is been my obsession yet no matter how hard I have tried I just fail.Everything else in life has been handed to me. I have a great family plenty of money I am skilled at almost anything I set my mind to I make friends easily when I want to but the one thing that always trips me up is my inability to relate to women in any kind of intimate romantic way. I always fail at that and my inability to experience the intimacy I long for and crave makes everything else in my life feel meaningless.Why should I care about being healthy having a job going to school having a family having skills and talents having hobbies having fun or doing anything if I cannot experience the one thing I want most having a lover? So I sacrifice and ignore everything else and lose myself in romantic fiction day in day out. Reading and watching it obsessively wanting to pretend the real me does not exist. I hate myself. I do not deserve to exist. I am literally the worst. I hate waking up in the morning and being alive. I cannot take this anymore,Depression
26836,26856,they are so fucked up and weird. Am I the only one? Like they are not even nightmares necessarily although they sometimes are that. Idk if you guys have ever had fever dreams but they feel literally exactly the same. They just feel really weird and bad idk how to describe it. Like literally last night whenever I would fall asleep I would go into this lucid dream where I kept on floating away up into the sky like a balloon and I had to keep grabbing on to things to keep myself grounded and to stop from floating away lmao. And I knew was dreaming and would try to keep waking myself up but end up falling back asleep again and again it went on for hours throughout the night. Can anyone else relate? Ssri withdrawal dreams,Depression

22663,22683,Why is it so fucking difficult to get a job I have tried for years and I still have no experience. I have been rejected in 3 interviews in this one week alone. What the actual fuck. I am getting sick and tired of this shit. My nonexistent confidence was shattered a long time ago because my stupid fucking ass cannot do a simple task like getting a job. My selfhatred is aggravated by the fact I cannot get a job and I spend most of the day absolutely miserable and wishing I would just not exist. I feel even worse because I paid 7k for a useless certificate that was supposed to help me! Not only that but I have a mark of distinction too! What am I doing wrong? The more I get rejected the more bitter I get. I feel fucking useless.The only thing that gets me through the day is my long distance girlfriend but she is not always around to talk and I do not want to bother her with my problems. She already knows how absolutely pathetic I am.I guess I am not really asking for help or anything I just am very upset right now and want to know that someone knows how I feel right now. Why is it such a struggle?,Depression
18294,18314,I do not know if this fits here if not I am sorryAfter having bad dreams like every night I recently discovered that it is way worse to have great dreams where your dreams come true. While a bad dream fades away after waking up a great dream makes you realize even more that your life is a nightmare. Nightmares,Depression

22900,22920,My downtime has reached to the point wherein when i see my own profile picture on my social media i get sadder and more down. Because for some reason i hate seeing how I am smiling and how i look happy in those pictures while in real life I am suffering. I want to remove them or change them to faceless ones or just deactivate all my accounts but i cannot do that because then my friends and family will ask what is wrong and i know they cannot help me at all. No to my own pictures,Depression

17096,17116,I have 32 been on antidepressants and anxiety meds for 2 12 years now and seeing a therapist twice a month. In all honesty it should have been much earlier but just now trying desperately to get a handle on my mental health. I want to talk to my family about it but do not want this to weigh on them or become a burdenworry about me. My wife and BiL also bipolar are the only ones who know. How do you tell someone that you do not feel emotions? You do not experience joy or pain. you are just numb. To everything and everyone. You do not want to kill yourself but you do not want to exist. That life has become a cycle of just getting through days. That simple things like getting out of bed are sometimes the hardest fucking thing ever. How do you explain depression to someone that has never experienced these feelings?,Depression
24702,24722,Never felt this doomed in my life my gf left me 2 months ago my mother is not really what you could call a functional person and since my rent expired I am living at her house for a few months. Friends basically disappeared. I am going to therapy but it does not really help me that much. I feel like I am going crazy and this truman show kind of place where I am living is killing me. If only I could kill myself for real Now what?,Depression
7147,7167,I am just so done honestly. The last two years have been shit I was forced out of a job suffered horrendously from bullying from my past two employers have been in therapy from it worked up the courage to get another job my role was cut by 30 hours a week and have been looking for work ever since I am so broke. I have been doing a course that has been extended by a year due to COVID lockdown after lockdown. I live at home I am not in a relationship I feel like a fucking loser. I have lost friendships made a friend who tried to make it more than friendship which was not what I wanted. I cannot go on vacation I just need a break.Today was the last straw I applied for two jobs weeks ago. I got one of them then they never replied for 6 weeks. I finally got a reply they told me they never recieved anything and blamed the mess on me I know the emails went through because they replied to me on that email address.I also applied for another job one I actually wanted. A job I was so excited for a feeling I have not felt in a long time. I was told I would be a great canidate I would work well with them. Today I got a rejection email before I was even interviewed. I am so upset and angry. do not comment 'It will get better' or 'it will work out in the end'. I am over that that does not help me now. I am so angry and have no idea what I am going to do in life. ampx200BTLDR I have no idea what I am doing in life I am sad angry and feel completely hopeless and depressed Why does everything always have to suck?,Depression
13286,13306,Recently my life has just been on a downward spiral. I do not enjoy spending time with my friends anymore. The only person I see is my boyfriend and I have began to feel like I am a burden to him. My family only reinforces that I have nothing going for me. Its so depressing to finally feel like your making baby steps just for a family member to take it all away from you with just a few harsh words. I feel stuck. I feel like I have nothing going for me,Depression

12326,12346,I hope it is okay to post this here. I have someone I know through online channels only who is going though a really hard time. Their parent is terminally ill they are the primary caregiver and they are suffering from depression.They have stopped returning messages and have been avoidant and clearly are very overwhelmed. We had an emotional and romantic interest in each other. I know up until he stopped replying he was still making those feelings known. He has told me several times when he is gone quiet that he is overwhelmed and dealing with a lot. he is always wanted me to know he still cares when does pop up and he is always maintained he still has those feelings for me. I know he is just so focussed on everything else going on which I completely understand.Now that he is retreating even longer than usual over a week and has not replied to my messages of concern I do not know if I should just leave him alone or continue to send him supportive messages. I do not want to be annoying but I also want him to know I care and I am thinking of him without any pressure to reply... But also do not want to pressure him in a romantic way in case he does not feel that way anymore.I would love to understand what people here would want in the same situation. I just want him to know I care and he is not alone. I do not expect anything else. Someone I care about is going through a really dark period. How can I help them?,Depression
19922,19942,tldr I am doing better my friends are so proud of me I finally believe in myself and I see a bright future in front of me. My family does not. They keep insinuating that I will not ever get better and that I am lazy and will not do anything with my life. How do I not go back to the dark place I was?A month ago was the first time I had felt genuine joy since 5th grade. After so many years of suicidal thoughts and apathy towards my life and future I started to have plans for my future I started to think about studying languages I started to say no I finally was standing up for myself.I now know I can do whatever I want to do. I now know I have friends that love me as much as I love them and they are so happy that I am doing better that I hang out with them they are proud of me. And my therapists have also told me that I am clearly doing better and they are also happy for me.I feel like I am rediscovering life without this dark veil that was covering my face because of my past and my family. Speaking of family unlike my friends I feel like they do not trust me to move on and have my own life they demoralize me and I just feel like I am going backwards on my progress when I am back home I live with them. They keep saying things like you have to work you have to study blablabla what if you start acting like before in a very condescending and negative manner as if I was the lazy useless person I thought I was for all these years. And whenever I talk about doing things with my life they are always like yeah but if you want to do those things you have to start working otherwise you are not going to do anything like I know all those things they do not need to constantly repeat that all the time.They do not believe in me and I am scared that I might go back to where I was. Does anyone know what I am talking about? I do not know if any advise can be given but that would be cool. After almost a decade I am finally doing better. My friends are very proud of me but my family does not trust me to move on with my life,Depression
26271,26291,I just turned 25 I am unemployed. The unemployment rate keeps getting higher and higher in my country. I have never had a relationship only sexual encounters no love. Girls think I am too ugly. I feel okay about my looks but girls seem not to think the same. I have severe social anxiety. cannot make friends easily. 25 AND GOING NOWHERE,Depression
23961,23981,Yea well. Here it is. I look at my life up until this point and really dwell on how many things I have been keeping to myself in mystical awe as to how I even manage to do it without driving myself crazy.I feel weird laying in bed tonight. it is 3 AM and I have work at 7 AM. Promised my girlfriend I would work out with her at 4 PM. I hope that still works out considering it is a promise and I have not worked out in years and am just now mustering up the courage. I want to preface that this post at times may feel it is losing its direction. Sorry about that I am writing what comes to my head. As I was saying I feel weird laying here tonight. My mind has a lot of thoughts going through it. Mainly the sense of confusion as to what is wrong with me. Right now I feel like there is a long line in front of me figuratively. Each thing in line is a different emotion. I am the receptionist at the front of the line and on most days I would deal with each emotion one at a time. These emotions do not ever seem to have a regular pattern. They can be constantly changing from feelings of sadness to intense anger internalized happiness not too frequent with this one anxiousness melancholy and what I see the most a dissatisfying meh that says everything feels fine today I am still moving along to the extent I can and not thinking about my true inner troubles.BUT tonight I am not dealing with the line. I am just letting it build up and having the front customer ring the bell over and over for my attention. I am looking at this line with a feeling of confusion and unfamiliarity as if I never dealt with it before. I have all of the emotions stacked up and I cannot seem to be able to process them. I feel everything but nothing at the same time it is white overwhelming but not at the same time. It sucks it took that long to explain how I feel currently and the silly part is that I do not feel satisfied from that explanation alone. I notice that for a while I have been unable to trust MY ability the inky real primary source of myself to tell someone how I am feeling. Because I am never sure myself. I am never familiar with how I am day today or will be tomorrow. Maybe I am just overthinking all of this or maybe I am not. How am I able to tell someone how I am feeling if I cannot understand or validate my initial thoughts. I know I will probably wake up tomorrow and look at this and brush it off as a bunch of rubbisH then push it to the back of my head for it all to come back again. FYI I am writing this completely sober. Where will I find my zen? I know that sounds cheesy but for real when and how will I find my inner selfunderstanding. I look at like with different mindsets and they switch up every day or week without my notice. I just recently got a screen for depression and for one I did not answer some of the questions honestly because I was too nervous too. But also these questions were driving me crazy I could not tell how to answer any of them. If I answered them a second time the day after I would have given different answers. That day I walked out of the doctor's office feeling selfcritical and angry about this. I wonder if my mindsets change too much. Maybe my personality is too malleable? I understand that people change but my view of how I view myself and the environment around me changes a bit drastically sometimes.I obsess over dumb shit. Waist too much time revisiting and spending extended periods of time pondering on them. Lately I have been very concerned by the possible idea that I may be bipolar or something. I feel so stupid for even typing that out but that is the truth as to how I have been thinking. I probably am not and I just overthink everything. But it roots from my desperate want to understand my emotions. Recently I had a day i do not remember why where I felt very very very low and sad. I have not had this feeling in a long time. I physically felt slow. I mentally felt unable to comprehend the external environment. I felt too lost in my head. The world around me shut off but I was still going on autopilot. I was so sad I felt numb. This was a buildup to this low from the past couple of days before. I was having some really dark thoughts I do not want to talk about. But the next day I felt so up to the point I had a euphoric feeling in my body for part of it. Now I feel like I am starting to level out again. That day admittedly I had a really fun day doing activities so maybe it was that. But what throws me off is how I went from SO SO LOw like you have to take my work for it to SO SO. high.I could go on more and more but my fingers would fall off from the typing and I am starting to get tired. I hope this post stays up. I guess all I am asking for is someone to listen. Even if you do not respond to this thank you for taking the time to hear my rambling. I am sorry if this feels like a shit post I do not expect everyone reading this to understand or relate I just do not know how else to convey my accumulating thoughts. I want to just unplug the drain a bit somewhere and for now this feels like it helps a bit. Venting is great. A drain that I never feel I have the time to unplug.,Depression
21898,21918,It is hard as hell not to feel bad about this past month. I have how sometimes in life when something goes wrong it keeps sucking until you die. I hate that some mistakes cannot be fixed. I am trying to hold out hope for the future but I am constantly reminded of what my life is now. I just have to remind myself I did not know but I hate that I have to suffer for my naivety. Trying to stay positive. I really do not want to take antidepressants. Feeling down,Depression
9833,9853,Why cannot I just end it? What stops me? I do not want to go to hell. that is what stops me. Why cannot God just take me. God I sound so pathetic. I cannot stand myself. I constantly wish for a disease that will kill me. Just typing this shit is making me feel such disgust for myself. Jesus Christ. I am a fucking asshole. Oh boo hoopity party. Fucking get the balls and fucking kill your self already or shut the fuck up!!!! I hate me!! Piece of shit.. Old and waiting to die,Depression
19479,19499,On another sub I had a convo with someone in a really bad place with depression but they do not have insurance and cannot afford counseling. Even the sliding scale fee structures of some online offerings are still too expensive. Does anyone know of a free online counseling service they could contact? Online Counseling for free?,Depression
20329,20349,This is not a pity post or anything like that. Just an explanation really. I do not cut to distract myself from trauma I am going through. I do not do it for this reason or that reason.To put it simply I hate my body. I always have ever since I was a little kid I absolutely despised my body and my genetics. Cutting is self destruction on the body. So what better way to show just how much I hate my body than to slowly damage and destroy it? Every scar is more evidence of how disgusted I am of myself. Why I cut,Depression
13652,13672,I am sick and tired of just about everything. I hate my job and spend 40 hours a week doing useless shit that I do not give a fuck about and that helps no one. I look to apply for other jobs and see more of the same boring mundane bullshit. I set aside the money that I earn from work to put towards some stupid dream or goal that I am supposed to have but I have no fucking clue what it is.All the paths that I am expected to take are a load of bullshit. I have no intrest in starting some career that will not mean jack shit once I am dead. I do not care about having kids or starting a family why would I want to drag them into existence? To try and navigate the shithole society that is only going to get worse? If they took after me they would probably not want to exist either with the way the world is. I honestly think I do not even care about relationships anymore either. I do not hate people per se but nowadays I find most people to be such a bore to be around and only have a small group of friends and family who I find tolerable. I would never want to just settle for whoever came along at the right time it would be unfair on them for me to not be entirely committed so I do not understand the point of holding out for my perfect match who does not even exist thinking that one day they will suddenly come along.I just do not know what to do. I used to think things like I wish I could just disappear but now I WANT to exist to experience the amazing things that I am sure are out there but I do not know what they are. It ends up being a more frustrating concept than wanting to vanish because you are wanting to exist for something that you are not even sure of and it creates layers of complex and contradicting thoughts and feelings.I just want to stop following this shitty road laid out by society towards a successful life of pointless bullshit and take the scenic route but I do not feel like I know what that scenic route even is or how to get there. I want to live a life I know I have thoroughly enjoyed and ideally to have left something worthwhile behind once it is over.I want a reason to wake up in the morning. I do not want to feel like I am wasting my time anymore. Tired of the whole thing. do not even know what to do anymore.,Depression
13735,13755,I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or selfpromoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anticapitalistmaterialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk you would not be ghosted. End I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar. PS. The matrix is one of my favorite movies. 26m no degree no job no car no money live in basement tldr,Depression
9352,9372,My great grandpa passed abt 2 months ago and ever since I have not only been mentally exhausted but physically drained every day. I have had depression for years but I have never been so far into it that I am perpetually sore and tired. I want to start working out again so I would feel better but i cannot get myself to start. I am not suicidal but I just want something to change. Like I am finding myself wanting to pack my things up and move away from this place. Grief,Depression
26401,26421,I am 30 m and she is 21 so if you want to judge me already then just please do not.I was with my dream girl and we got along great. But she has a serious drug and alcohol problem. I care about her a lot and tried to help her stop using them so much. Totally backfired and she started seeing other guys who were not so judgmental about it like me. I told her I cared about her and loved her and wanted to see her healthy and happy. She told me she could not be herself around me.This really sucks... someone pls talk to me I fucked up my relationship and now I am sad,Depression
24154,24174,I cannot stop dreading about going to work. I cannot stop worrying about what my next job will be or what career I should go into. I cannot stop being self conscious around other people. I cannot stop analysing pretty much everything that I have ever done or said. Every single night I struggle to sleep because my brain will not stop. I think I am incapable of being in a relationship because I do not understand why anybody would want me. I know that I need more help and yet I am worried about going back to the doctor's. I feel like I am just wallowing in selfpity and that I am weak and pathetic. I still cannot get over my dad's suicide and I think I am going to go down the same path at some point. And yet I cannot stop thinking that there is not a point in anything. I cannot stop worrying and yet there is no point? I do not understand myself but there is one thing I do understand. I feel like shit and I do not like myself. I am sick of life,Depression
23951,23971,I went to a therapist in november I have been taking them from that time but the therapy is about to end. My psychiatrist told me that I can lessen the daily amount slowly then leave it. The first days was horrible the bad thoughts came back in my head you worth nothing you should hang yourself nobody loves you I started to hate people again and got annoyed by every little shitty thing. I recognized that even my body language changed back I did not look in peoples eyes while talking I curved my back I started to scratch my arms etc. I am not sure that an 8 month cognitive therapy can change the last 1015 years patterns built up in me. Is it possible that I have to take antidepressants for a life?,Depression
13746,13766,No motivation to try and better my life I am not depressed i am just empty and have no purpose to live for myself,Depression

16974,16994,I had 2 friends. I knew we were drifting apart and I was trying by myself to make the friendship work. Well once again life has happened and they have proven yet again that I am not important to them.A tornado hit my area like a week ago. I texted one of my friends and asked him if he was okay since he lives further up the coast. He said he was fine. I told him I was really scared and I never heard back from him again.Fast forward to the day before yesterday. My last remaining grandma died unexpectedly. My head is messed up and so is my heart. I just needed some support. I texted my other friend who ghosts me regularly and was trying to joke and make small talk. He said now is not a good time. My sadness has turned into anger. I am absolutely fucking pissed. I did not ask for shit other than some companionship. Yet they discarded me like I was a fucking piece of garbage! I hate the both of them. I hate them. I hate myself more for even thinking they were my friends. I cannot believe I stuck around for 6 amp 7 years for it to end like this. I fucking hate them so much. All I am seeing is red. Why???,Depression
15528,15548,Or my souvenirs are wrong idk this feeling is so weird is this depersonalisation? that is my best bet. Why do I feel like this?

7592,7612,So my parents have this thing where they will take a long time to let minor wrongdoings go. They hold all my small inconveniences over my head and it makes me feel awful. For example they started yelling at me for being ungrateful about the help they give me which is completely untrue by the way and when I started to fight back because I am done with just sitting down and taking it they hold it over my head for at least the rest of the day. It makes me feel like nothing I do is good enough for them. How do I deal with this? Whenever I try to talk to them about anything wrong that they do they always get angry about it. What do I do? Parent issues,Depression
22962,22982,I have had depression since I was 12. I do not have motivation nor energy even for the things I like. I have a smothering relationship with my parents. I am almost 27 years old with no reason to live no relationships and no money. I want to escape and live somewhere else. I will find a deadend job and find an apartment. No one understands nor tries to understand what I am going through. For everyone else the solutions are straightforward. Move out see a therapist take antidepressants get a job meet new people read books on selfhelp learn to love me more learn from my mistakes. I have done several of those things. Will doing all those things together heal me? I feel depression will never leave me. it is always been there talking very loudly or softly at times. No one really tries to talk to me and understand. Everyone just judges me as an irresponsible lazy inmature naive silly introverted boring square person. No one tries to understand and even if they did no one can help me.The person in my life which I loved the most broke up with me. She did not love me. And she is better off without me. She confessed how she did not break up with me earlier because of how I would react and be afterward. She was right and I feel like shit and it is not just the breakup. I have tried meditation no contact therapy books hobbies introspection you name it. I am not worthy of love or understanding. I know she knew she did not like who I am. I cannot do anything about that. But no one has ever liked me. that is why I have no friends. that is why the unending cycle of rejections of everyone including family members.What I hate the most is that I just want that person who broke up with me to reach out. But that will not do any good. Even if she really did love me like me and cared it would not change anything. Am I better off dying? I ask myself this question every day. My presence in people's lives has only hurt it. I have nothing but prove. it is like having a terminal disease. I just destroy everyone around me as I slowly die because I have no convictions will desires and goals. But I cannot choose to kill myself. I cannot stand the thought of dying. I want to live. I want to want to be better. But that is just it I would like to have the desire to be better. Deep down I want peace to be understood and love but that does not cure depression. I have even taken medicine in the past. Nothing has helped. I am useless worthless just meaningless. I do not want to live anymore,Depression

17410,17430,the worst part is i cannot even tell if I am faking it or not. it does not feel fake idk. i broke up with my ex girlfriend several days ago because her mental health was starting to affect mine and we did not have a healthy relationship. its just when you love someone so much that its hard to see them like that. but throughout our relationship i found my self in really depressive states and when she was contemplating suicide i did too and that started to give me suicidal thoughts and they have not gone away. i do not think i would ever do it i want to live. but what this relationship has done to me is mentally and physically drained me. i know I am not the only one who is drained but right now how I am feeling is that the future is useless. i know how its going to end. I am going to meet someone new fall in love get a dream job get some cats maybe but is it really worth it? because i cannot even explain what the next few days are going to be like my last relationship has made me highly depressed and a bit suicidal,Depression

22562,22582,I have been struggling with depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts since 2017. Everything feels grey tasteless and horrible. Recently I decided to take an action I took a therapy session online the psychiatrist was an asshole but he prescribed me some medicine. The problem is I am too afraid to take any antidepressants but at the same time I want to be able to help myself!I am 24 years old now unemployed I have never been with anyone because of the way I look at myself I feel that I am dum worthless and ugly most of the time I have none to talk about this specific thing because my family is religious and probably they would judge me for opining up. What should I do?Sorry about my English its not my first language Living with depression,Depression
21788,21808,I was recently diagnosed with gallstones and had my gallbladder removed. However there were some complications and now there are stones stuck in the duct.The 7 months of time between noticing symptoms and the surgery i lost 60 pounds as I have been having a lot of trouble eating. Eating used to be one of the few thing that brought me joy now if i even try to snack ill feel intense nausea for hours. Even worse is the fact I am scared to leave my house because I know I am going to end up feeling sick no matter what. It really sucks when people ask me hangout and my excuse is always I am not feeling well. Feeling sick all the time has made me so much more depressed,Depression

13705,13725,Hi. This is the first time that I post something here. Also English is not my first language so sorry about the bad grammar I am writing here because I am in that point of my life where I do not know what to do anymore. I know that this may sound like a very common thought in this sub but I think that my situation is a little different from the rest. I have been dealing with a deep sadness and a terrible lack of sleep during the past two months. I do not get a properly rest and I feel like my mind is slowly going to hell. College was easy for me but not anymore. I feel dumb I forget things very easily and everything seems foggy. I use to be extremely perfectionist with my classes and not be able to get the results I want anymore is just frustrating. This makes me feel depressed because even before this problem started my life was not as good as I would want this just made me even consider suicide. I even tried two times but I did not succeed. I am incompetent even for thatI know that I should look for professional help but that is the problem. Its like on the one hand I know that I need help but on the other hand I do not want it. I do not know how to properly explain that and yeah I know it is pretty stupid. Maybe is the fear to be judged or maybe I already became insane who knows. Look I do not have many friends to talk and the few that I do I do not think they will understand. My parents well They do not know about this. I still have a little of contact with them but I am not sure if it could be a good idea tell them this because I do not want to because them more problems. Mom is receiving chemotherapy and she is obviously not in her best moment. I do not know what is next. Sometimes I just want someone to tell me that it is going to be okay. To give me some hope or at least give me a plausible or compelling reason to get help and talk about this out. Well that is all I think. Thank you for reading. And have a nice day. I just want some hope.,Depression

25963,25983,...So I could feel like I had a reason to be depressed. Like I deserved sympathy or empathy for my depression. I am good looking intelligent employed and empty inside. I was emotionally neglected but not obviously so. Anyone who would understand has had it worse than me it seems so what do I have to complain about? it is as if my depression is unjustified. Like there is no reason to ask for help because I should not need it in the first place. And yet I move through life without meaning and a fabricated purpose. I feel unseen and like I do not deserve to be seen because I have not suffered enough and my low sense of self is unworthy selfloathing. Why speak up about feelings I should not have? Just suffer silently and one day I will enjoy the sweet release of death and only you anonynous Redditors will have heard the voiceless words of my sadness I kind of wish my life had been worse...,Depression
9907,9927,My parents are on vacation at the moment and its just me and my older sister home.I had my girlfriend over and we had sex talked and watch a movie. I asked my sister yesterday if she could have slept over and she said no I know it was selfish and wrong of me to still take her home with me but I just wanted 1 day just 1 day of not feeling terrible of just being myself.I have religious parents and just a religious family in general. I do not believe in anything and accept how they are and what they believe in but they still want me to be a certain way. I still remember when I was 16 years old and told my dad that I liked a girl and my mom and dads response was you do not know what love is and you are not allowed to be with anyone. I feel so fucking different from my family and I know it was selfish of me but yesterday was the one day I felt some resemblance of joy I am 20 years old and I have been spending my whole life miserable and I have not been allowed to be myself and I just hate who I am because of what my family expects from me. My sister and my girlfriend kind of got into a bit of an argument because of it. I have never felt this way about anyone and yet still I have a hard time pursuing happiness. I have not eaten today and just laid in bed all day.I do not know why I am so different from the rest of my family we all grew up the same way but I still ended up so different from my siblings and my whole family.Like I said I know it was selfish of me but I just wanted 1 day of feeling different 1 day of getting some rest and to just try and be happy instead of miserable. I do not know what is wrong with me and I am even sorry for writing this and venting about it maybe I do not even deserve it. I did something too make me happy and it only caused pain. I guess I am just constantly going to feel isolated from my family.,Depression

26590,26610,Yesterday morning I had to put my beautiful loving cat to sleep and I just do not know what I am going to do. This is my 3rd cat in 8 years all of which suddenly die before the age of 3 due to things I cannot control. I took my cat to the vet weeks ago and he was fine then Friday night he was on the verge on the death. He helped with my depression and anxiety whenever it got super high and I relied on him to help me get through whatever i was going through. He was the most important thing in my life and he got snatched from me in the blink of an eye. I do not know why this keeps happening. I just feel empty and am at the absolute worst pain of my life.

12104,12124,Hello I am not even really sure where to start. I graduated late from high school a few months back due to my learning disability and everyone around me just expects me to know what the hell to do with my life. Since the pandemic all the avenues I previously had mapped out in my head for jobs have died due to seeing how the industries I was interested in have been affected. Now I cannot make any decisions on if college is even worth it too because I wanted to go to help me get out of my she will and social anxiety but due to having to wear masks and social distancing and most colleges opting for online courses I do not see how my social skills will even improve or how the experience is worth it. My high school was online for the last two years I went and I assumed college would be different. People are also pressuring me to get a job but recently I have not been able to see the point in that either as I do not want to commit to another thing where I am surrounded by people who make me feel empty. Part of me kind of just wants to die. I have been killing time trying to figure out what to do and every single time I try to talk to someone who might give me any advice they brush me off and tell me that since I am an adult it is my responsibility to figure out what to do. I have no passions left the only interests I used to have are not job material. I feel like I fought super hard to get nowhere in life. Was supposed to start my life at 21 but now I do not see the point.,Depression

10544,10564,I have a lot of terrible intrusive thoughts throughout the day and by the end of the night I feel very depressed. I have had med changes for it already and it got a little better at first but now it is bad again. I know the thoughts are not true but overtime enough of them really bring me down. The thoughts are mostly things like I am a failure or everyone secretly hates me. Sometimes the thoughts are suicidal. I also stop feeling safe at night and thoughts of trauma my own or things I have seen others go through invade my thoughts. I dissociate often and experience derealization every day. I am in therapy and have spent years working on my trauma and made a lot of progress but recently am struggling through this. What has been your own experiences with this and what helped you feel peace again at night? Nighttime demons,Depression
15922,15942,I have been experiencing depression and anxiety for a year and a half now. I have been on ups and downs trying to fight it. Sometimes I will experience sudden anxiety attacks here and there but that is it. After my grandmother died my aunt having a fight with her girlfriend my dad having a mistress me being sexually harassed without no one knowing and finding out my mom have a 200k debt. I am numb. I felt nothing. I just cried then brushed it off. But today I made a dumb move. I only have a few friends and only 1 very close friends that knows and that is there for me. ampx200BI accidentally caused a trouble between her and my other friend causing her to be mad at me. She said I should say sorry to our friends. So I did. But after I sent my apology message I had an attack. But this is one is severe and i only experienced it once. I hide myself in my closet and continuously cried for hours only saying I am sorry it is my fault I did it over and over again. After that I just sat inside the dark closet and did nothing.ampx200BI fucked up. My head feels numb. I do not know what to do. Suicide came in my mind but the pain of experiencing death scares me. I want to die but is there a way to die painlessly Sometimes I just question god why? Why am I experiencing this? I am just fng 14! I just want to be happy cannot I do that? I do not want this I did not wished for this! So why? WHY?ampx200BI am scared. it is so lonely. I am sorry. I am sorry it is my fault i did it,Depression

13225,13245,Over 12 years ago I M had bad anxiety with random panic attacks. Depression was mixed in there as well probably due to the anxiety they went hand in hand. I went to therapy and a psychiatrist. I was put on lexapro and the panc attacks stopped. I have since moved far away from those doctors have not been to therapy in years. I just kept taking lexapro from my primary because why not. No one ever said to stop. But in the past year or two my concentration has been getting worse and I felt other random little physical side effects from the medicine had just become annoying and thought why not stop lexapro it is been years. I had to stop taking it before at one point due to moving and finding new doctor so I knew about withdrawals and I had to stop another couole prescriptions before lexapro was the one. I slowly lowered my dose every week or two for about a month or so. Eventually I stopped and of course physical withdrawals came on brain zaps and all. I stopped 4 weeks ago and the zaps stopped about a week ago. I have been less tired in the mornings which was a big struggle on lexapro always tired. I have been overall feeling myself. But I am still having some mental things. I am still finding myself having random moments of depression. Just feeling hopelessness and thinking about the things I enjoy as a waste of time. I try to just work through it and tell myself it is temporary thinking it could be the medication adjustment. The other weird thing is since I stopped the lexapro I have had odd sexual side effects. Like decreased sensation weaker orgasm not lasting as long etc. I have never had this on lexapro only one I stopped completely. This is starting to bother me and I am thinking there is some permanent problem from 10 years of lexapro.My main thing is what do I do now? Is this still normal adjustments from coming off lexapro or an SSRI in general? I am not having panic attacks or bad anxiety which is why I took it years ago in the first place. Do I talk to a primary first? Should I try therapy? Go back on medication? Or go to a psychiatrist first? The problem is I have really crap insurance that only covers psychiatry and therapy through MD Live and I see mixed reviews on that so I keep getting put off from trying it. Also not sure if a therapist or psyciatrist is who I should talk to about this.Maybe someone out here went through something similar. I feel like I started with anxiety years ago and ended up with new problems and depression. Not sure what to do next,Depression
39690,39687,i had so many suicidal thought last night while i wa driving to try to make myself feel better i thought drowning is scary but i can go put my car in the river and drown then i went well let s look up to see what medication we have that might do it i m just so tired i ve tried so many different medication at this point i do therapy nothing ha worked i m still holding onto a little sliver of hope thing won t always be this way maybe one day i can keep my house clean all the time maybe one day i won t be so stressed and anxious maybe one day i ll be able to stay consistent and do well at my job if feel like it s further and further away i also just believe i m a total fucking failure at and discredit all the thing i ve done because it s just not good enough to me i don t know how to stop the negative self talk oh and i m also sometimes hearing voice lately sometimes i know they re not there real other time they sound like they re right next to my window or in my house i really wish i could just not exist for a week or a month why can t i just shut it all fucking off for a while i even just had a nice date with my partner and i m already back to thinking well i should still kill myself soon,Depression

19393,19413,I have been feeling a giant mental breakdown coming for the past few days ever since my mom started shit with me last week. she is got to be a sociopath or something bc she truly feels no remorse and has no sympathy for anyone but herself. she is a crazy gaslighter and always makes me feel like everything is my fault when I know that it is not. Anyway I have been having an abundance of issues that have all started after my dad unexpectedly passed away last year. I think its due to the immense amount of stress and grief. Its very upsetting bc these health issues take so much of my life away I have physical limitations now and very strict diet restrictions. Its a very hard adjustment especially when its all hitting at the same time. I have been able to handle it tho up until my mom starts shit with me. Then I just get so triggered I break all the way down. So I have been extremely upset due to all of this. I was writing a list of all the reasons I hate my life. And literally as I am in the middle of writing my mom walks in the door and starts more shit with me. I am shaking and I feel so paranoid and even delusional like I am losing touch with reality I am so upset. All these memories of the past year come flooding back. I am so stuck cannot get a break,Depression
17989,18009,I quit my job after unable to stop my suicidal thoughts at work now that I am unemployed my self worth is even lower.Why bother living? Quit my job I am too depressed for this,Depression
21074,21094,Please forgive the inarticulate wording of this post I am mentally exhausted and it is become increasingly difficult to verbalize or write out how I am feeling but I feel like I am going to burst if I do not put it down somewhere. it is been a really rough three weeks.I have spent twenty years in a vicious cycle of depression and suicidal ideation the first time I remember wanting to die was in fifth grade. Part of it was triggered by my home life my immediate family struggled with domestic violence and substance abuse episodes. Ultimately we were all emotionally damaged people who could not talk about it to each other so I looked for consolation elsewhere. I distracted myself I lost myself in my head a la JD from Scrubs I ate too much. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not I am still alive so I guess it is been successful in that regard. In recent years I have become almost a total recluse outside of work. I have been lucky enough to meet some great people through my job that gives me some level of interaction but at the end of the day I know I am less important to them than they are to me. it is similar with my extended family they are tightknit and close and people that do not punch holes in walls or threaten to put you in a wall. I get the requisite invitations to holiday parties and they are always polite to me but I will never be part of the fold. that is not an accusation or something I blame them for. I am the daughter of their black sheep drug addict son I would not want to be around me either. I am fundamentally worthless. I have known this for a long time but I have really come to realize while taking inventory of my life so far. I am not loveable I am not worth anything at the end of the day and largely would not be missed. I am afraid of dying funny enough I have always been a bit of a hypochondriac but I just want it to be over. I am exhausted and I do not think I will ever be happy again and I just want it to be over. The only reason I am still here is because of my mother. I am hanging on so she does not have to bury me. Anyways. I needed to say it somewhere. Tired,Depression
20580,20600,Hi. I have been struggling with anxiety and depressive episodes for years. Sometimes I feel like I am not even a person. Some places trigger that weird feeling of yearning old railway stations trains abandoned buildings cemeteries.When I come across these places I am starting to think about people who rolled through these locations. I often completely dissolve during sitting on a bench at the station. When I am waiting for my train I usually spend all my time observing people who are passing by and thinking about their stories. Who are they? Where are they going?I feel like I am blending into the environment and losing a sense of being a separate being. Have you ever felt the same way? Is this how depersonalization feels like? I could not find a more suitable disorder. Sorry If my explanations were not precise enough but English is not my mother tongue. Is this a depersonalization?,Depression

I also have food on my table everyday a roof over my head phones a console a laptop stable internet etc. yet I hate my life. I do not think there has been a day where the thought of dying has not crossed my mind. I just feel... Sad. I feel like a spoiled brat who is faking these feelings and should be grateful for everything he has I feel like a good for nothing idiot who only knows how to disappoint and worry people and I also feel like a waste of space who has nothing interesting to say and annoys people in social situations. I try and hide these feelings in order to not worry my family but I cannot be bothered with anything anymore. I have also tried having a more positive outlook on life lying to myself that if I were to try harder everything would be better. That has not worked. I do not even know why I am venting here when I have everything I could ever want in life. I just want to disappear.

47701,47685,Is this really my life? Being alive feels like a punishment and being ugly just makes it worse. I feel like I've committed a grave sin just for looking the way I do. I feel like such a fuck up right now. My social anxiety just keeps getting worst and it's even worse when I go out in public and I keep thinking about all the mistakes that I've made and how I'm seen as less than everybody. I hate my fucking self rn. I hate my fucking face and my life and just every fucking thing about me. I hate that I'm mentally unstable and... I'm so tired. I really don't want to die but I don't want to really be here. I wish I could restart my life and make better choices. Maybe things would be better for me rn. I hate that I expect myself to be perfect 247 and then get all frustrated when I can't meet those expectations and just beat myself up.,Depression

11210,11230,I had a pretty bad mental breakdown last week and my psych whom I really trust added two things to my treatment.I am on Bupropion 300mg which I love.She also gave me Eszoplicone for sleeping worked but it made me very tired. I used to take zolpidem but my anxiety was so bad it would not work. This worked but I still slept terribly waking up every two hours vivid dreams drowsy brain etc.She also gave me an anti psychotic Abilify. My experience in the past with them has been quite bad. I took quetiapine and one week later I told her I never wanted it again. I have experience the worst feelings when I took anti psychotics.I also read they are not so common to treat depression and anxiety and seem to be given more to people with well... psychosis? But I am not the expert so I do want to give it a try. I feel my anxiety is still pretty bad during the day so if this would help it would be great. I am not asking for medical advice obviously but just some general thoughts or your experiences to calm me down before I take it.Also I never asked my psych if I should take them before or after the antidepressants. I plan on texting her when it is a bit later.The magic of mental illnesses A bit scared to start taking antipsychotics. Anyone with experiences?,Depression

I have horrible intrusive thoughts that make me feel sick and anxiety that completely isolates me. I genuinely feel like I do not belong here I do not feel like I serve a purpose. I am seriously alone besides a few people in my life and my family just does not feel like one. I feel disgusting as a human being and feel like no one can ever love me. So many things are on my plate rn and I do not know what to juggle or how to handle it. I really want to get on medication but I am scared of the side effects. Life feels doable one minute and the next I do not feel like being here. It hurts to write this as I do not feel like that is good to say but its just how I feel. I hate who I am and how I think and the thoughts that go through my head. I just want to be of free of them and feel fulfilled. I am an empty she will of what I should be and hate every second of what I am Rn. I need help I need to get on something I just do not know what,Depression

I just hate feeling like this feeling like i cannot trust anyone or that no one would ever truly love me unless i have something to offer. I am always worried about my looks and its just making me depressed. I really do not feel like i fit in with the world I am just here.

9766,9786,Hello I am a 17yr old bisexual male in india. The last few months I was feeling really sick but did not have any symptoms so my friend asked me to take a couple of psych tests and they all came back saying I am moderately depressed or severely depressed. I have been feeling suicidal for about 3years now ever since I faced bullying in my old school and was hospitalized for liver failure because I tried to kill my self with pills. This was 3 years ago. Every thing since then has felt extra. I lately have not been able to do anything about it because of my studies. I cannot seek help because if i tell my parents they will simply discard it saying it is an excuse not to study they are wired that way and I do not have enough money on my own to seek help indipendently. I am clueless as to what I am supposed to do Advice pls,Depression

23362,23382,Life is not worth it anymore. No one would really care if I died. My parents would be sad for a while. But soon they would realize that I was only making their lives worse. People in my life should be thankful when I kill myself. They should be thankful that I decided to make their lives better by giving up my own. I do not have any friends who will care. I am done living for others. If my life is not worth living I cannot hold myself back because of them. People in my life would not be sad that I died. They would be sad that anyone died. Does that make sense? They would not care that I am gone they would just be shocked that anyone died. Not because of anything I did. My life adds nothing to the lives if the people around me. And it never will. it is not worth it for me.,Depression

6963,6983,I do not know how to navigate these feelings not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner a great connection to their family a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be I have a Bachelor in fine art because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud or whatever. 0 to 100,Depression
47173,47161,i hate myself i really hate myself so much like im basically the worst its impossible for me to even keep friends they always end up hating me like why cant i just be normal like everyone else? my mind just spirals making me think about stuff i dont want to and making me more and more depressed which then ends up making people i talk to hate me which then makes everything even worse like whats even the point of my existence,Depression
18243,18263,I believe I am losing control of my mental health. it is excruciatingly painful and I have been crying almost every day. I am just trying to get by and survive hoping that death will come and pick me up. I am tired but my eyes are filled with sadness and I do not care if people will fancy me anymore. I hate being liked I do not even like myself. So I am not going to waste my time convincing myself that everything will be fine it is not going to happen sweetie. The thing about being anonymous on the internet is that no one will know you are fucked up in the head. Yes I am fucked up in the head. Fucked up in the head,Depression
48159,48141,Confused about reason So at the current time in my reality I finished school around 2 years ago and have been jobless since I've been living with my family. The days have become dull and timewasting I feel like my time sleeping and dreaming is more fulfilling and lively for me than being awake... When I wake up I turn on my computer and if I'm not doing something with my family I'll sit for 1214 hours a day with breaks of making food and stuff... Everything has become obscurely pointless I feel like I'm wasting my life on temporary things... A part of me just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering while the other part wants to start and become something grand. I despise how society is built everything feels so complex and demanding. Many times again I've wished that the world was of a past era a downgrade if you will where economy complexity orderliness greed and money wasn't discovered. Anyways probably gonna feel better tomorrow.,Depression
25717,25737,I am getting a wave of depression yet again and it is keeping me up tonight so I just wanted to talk. Whenever this happens it usually involves selfdoubt and loathing it is so frustrating. I recently graduated from college and this whole transition to adulthood thing is making it exponentially worse. When I talk to my friends about it I just feel like I am constantly burdening them even though they are very supportive. I really love and appreciate them and they are one of the few reasons I am not spiraling out of control. As if depression was not enough I also suffer from social anxiety though it has gotten much better than was a few years ago. As you can imagine that just destroys any bit of personality I have. I provide pretty much little to nothing in conversation between friends and I find it hard to make friends at work or anywhere really since I am so bland and boring. Another problem I have is that my selfhatred really destroys my selfconfidence and affects the way I portray myself to other people. It makes me seem less approachable or just not worth approaching. With the frequent waves of depression I have been experiencing lately I am afraid I am going to start drifting apart from my friends and end up alone. it is just so hard to live feeling like this with these thoughts. I feel like there is a constant pressure on my chest. Now onto some positives about me that I should remind myself about. I am witty and funny once in a while. I get myself up and working when I have to even if I do not want to. I am doing a good job of stepping out of my comfort zone and tackling my social anxiety by working in customer service. I have been putting effort into a hobby I am passionate about and working towards improvement. This is starting to sound like a diary but I guess that is what my whole account essentially is. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and I hope you encounter something that will make you smile todaytonight Feel free to reply or comment anything. Just spilling my feelings,Depression

12082,12102,Not sure if I am going to go through with it yet. cannot stop thinking about how my family and friends will feel but I truly feel like my life will never get better. I was molested by my older male cousin as a kid and my other cousin made me go down on her. All before the age of 10. Every time I see them I have to act like it did not happen and everythings cool but I have been hyper sexual since. Questioning my sexuality and identity. My parents had an awful marriage and I witnessed it fall apart. Dad is a gambling addict and cheated on my mother. Had twins with this other woman and hid it from me for almost 18 years. Grew up around domestic violence I was beaten as a child. My own mother punched me in the face once. My sister is schizophrenic because of all the trauma me and her have been through. We both were bullied at school and have had racist remarks and jokes said to us. Even been encouraged to end it. I was falsely accused of sexual harassment for a kiss on the cheek and now I have a reputation as an abuser even though I am not. I have been trying so hard for so long and nothing ever changes. No woman will ever love me for who I am and not what I provide. Nobody cares about my passionart and its the only thing that brings me joy. Too bad Ill never get anywhere with it and Ill have to work a job I hate for the rest of my life and die. Wrote my suicide note,Depression

9267,9287,Everything is fuckedThe Earth is fucked. Climate change is just going to get worse and at this point I cannot do anything about it. The corporations and billionaires are just going to keep exploiting and raping the world of all of its treasures and natural beauties. I do not want to live in a world that is on its death bed. what is the point of going to college right now when I am not going to get a good job anyways. I may as well drop out and get a shit job because that is what Ill end up with no matter what. would not it be better if I just killed myself and rid the world of one less wasteful person? Population is an issue anyways. I do not want to work my entire life never being able to retire. I fucking hate that I am addicted to my phone because its one of the only things I can occupy myself with without cutting myself to shreds. I became an adult last year and all I wish I could do is either die or go back to the ignorance and bliss of childhood. I want to be a happy idiot instead of a sad one. All that would make me happy is for me to live in the woods away from all people until I starve. I used to want to study film in school and now that I am all I want to do is quit. There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together. It does not even mean much because I am a fucking film student. I am wasting my time with a major that is a scam. The only issue is that there is nothing else in the world that I would study. I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself. I do not even have the balls for that. I think about it every day but I am not brave enough to do it. I may even join the military and hope that I can die. I really need someone to just listen,Depression

16536,16556,Hey guysI have been depressed most my adult life but these past few years have been really bad. Back in 2016 I developed this headache and neck pain that to this day pretty much runs my whole life. I have had a headache of just about every minute of every day since one specific day in 2016. No doctor has ever been able to figure out. So I am forced to just live in pain and basically act like its not there if I want to try and do much of anything. I had dreams and goals since I was in HS. I wanted to be a P.H.d molecular biologist doing some sort of academic research or work in industry. I worked really hard and got into the best uni in my state got a full ride and during college did fairly well with a lot of new aspirations developing. I was depressed on and off during this time. Usually having to do with girls or test grades or finances. Stuff that you can deal with. But all in all i had a lot of friends and would say I was generally a happy person.Then the headache hit. I always thought it would just go away one day but as the months grew I started to isolate and become incredibly depressed. I got through school but it was so ugly. Had to use substances just so that I could even study molecular biology. At this point I was starting to get really upset with everything. Often I would get upset with my friends and peers because they did not have to deal with this. I would get invited to stuff but honestly nothing is fun anymore especially social situations. I moved across the country after college to get a job and hopefully start fresh. But nothing changed. At this point I am basically certain this medical condition and the depression are here to stay forever. Imagine having a good child hood got everything we needed great education growing up no child trauma at all get a full ride for the schooldegree you have been wanting for years and graduate. Only to realize that nothing you accomplish will make you happy. It hurts more than the headache itself lately. My soul is wounded and I have completely lost hope. I have been on and off meds for a few years and none of them help.And the thing that makes me suicidial is when my friends and family act like I am doing great because I have a fancy job a nice car and my own place. I have told them how I experience the world and some of them just do not believe it and attack my character. I feel like a lost sheep alienated from the world. I am basically jealous of every single person I interact with. Lately I will be walking around near my apartment and I will seriously get jealous of homeless people. All I want is to enjoy this beautiful world and enjoy my accomplishments and the company of loved ones. depression and chronic health problems,Depression
27147,27167,Lotta background you do not actually need but if you are curious its all right thereLong story notsoshort i have 20 years solid of trauma and health conditions that put me in debilitating pain and unable to move a good third of the time. I have been to a few therapists was hospitalized after a suicide attempt largely ignored my last one was on meds for a brief while and stopped because my psychiatrist second one btw said i was making up side effects. After that i stopped trying. Not just in therapy but also in life. I barely graduated high school even just a short year earlier having held valedictorian status i have not been employed in almost 2 years i smoke weed and cry all day. Every day. Naturally I have been thinking about therapy again. More accurately i called every place near me and after a few months had an appointment with an old ass white man. So in this one appointment we went over intake and then he said i had not been honest enough i should just go on medication heavy medication and therapy would not help me. Fun perspective considering how hard my former psychiatrists pushed for me to be in therapy but whatever. It just got me to thinking...... Wow. He did not have a single thing to offer. To recommend medication is one thing but telling me i would not get anything out of seeing a therapist is something I have never once been told before in my life.Then i thought about my past therapists. Like the family therapist we had seen after my mom remarried. One of the group issues was boundaries i ended up having a break down about not wanting to be near the family members who had been molesting me for years. Her response? Oh i get it. I was a middle child too it is so hard to be heard. Yeah that reeeeeeally was not it.The next one was before trying to kill myself i had gone to two appointments and had just finished up the intake. There was a lot i had not disclosed but quite a bit of issues i had. When i went in to my third appointment she told me there was no reason for me to be in therapy i was not depressed i was entirely fine wasting her time and i needed to leave but it is okay because since we will not be doing the appointment she would only be charging insurance and not charging my mom her copay.After my suicide attempt i was required to see another. I feel a little bad about my experience with this therapist but ultimately i saw her entirely silently for three months it was a big organization and another woman did my intake. At the first appointment she had given me a ball of yarn and held the other end so we could feel connected through the silence. I knew she was not the one then but my mom insisted i keep going. I think at the third? appointment she had shown me videos of people shaking to relieve ptsd. Yup i declined doing that verbally. Several times as she kept asking one time saying i do not even have to touch you which should a fucking given even if i did actually have a therapeutic relationship with her. As time went on i was shocked she had not notified anyone that i was not actually part of therapy at all so i had gone in and asked her what she was writing on the insurance forms bc you need a vague appointment description for insurance to cover it. She said that on the first forms she had written that we were getting to know each other and building trust but that now she had been writing that we were learning coping skills. I replied so you have been lying? And she looked shook stumbled on words for a second and quietly nodded. After that i kept telling my mom i did not want to see her eventually she said i did not have any good reason to stop and i asked if my therapist never reaching out to let her know i was not talking was a good enough reason. My last appointment was the following day.My next therapist seemed okay ig she was at the same facility as my psychiatrist who i stopped seeing and i figured it would be easiest to just never go back there. Tbh in those 2 or 3 appointments though the only thing i remember her doing was giving me packets to read.While in the hospital all we did was group therapy where no one really talked and i was told there was no reason for me to be crying.So all in all I am really feeling unable to live and everyone just says to go to therapy. So what the fuck was i supposed to be getting out of therapy? What do they have to offer? Because so far it is actually so little that it hurts. What did your therapist have to offer?,Depression
47459,47444,Depressive hole What is in the depressive hole? Here is this big brain fog. You kind of not care. You don't care about anyone. You don't care about yourself. Or maybe care in some way but you don't LOVE. You feel like you lack. You feel like you are bad person. You don't deserve anything you are worthless. Everything is worthless. It just puts you down you feel weak. But can you love this depressive hole in some way? can you be it's friend? Can you love it? Can you STILL love. Can you love?,Depression
8074,8094,I am tired of being alone. I do not have any friends to talk to or hang out with and I have never dated anybody before. I was a loner in school and did not make any friends I sat by myself everyday at lunch and never had anybody to talk to. My dating life is the same way since I never really had friends I never got the chance to talk to any girls either. I have never dated a girl or been in a relationship with one. I am 23 and live by myself and honestly I have a pretty good life. I am responsible independent have money saved up and I always have a job. I am doing really well for myself especially for my age. It would just be nice to have somebody to reach out to or some people to hang out with. I would also like to start dating but I have no idea how to meet girls especially when you have no friends. I have just been going about my life the last few years but I am starting to get really depressed. I do not want to be alone like this 2030 year's from now and it seems like now that I am out of school and working it is even harder to meet people. The only time I meet new people is at work. I know I obviously need to make friends but how? I play my guitar go fishing cook and I also like to read. I know what I need to do i just do not know how to do it...like how does somebody who has zero friends just starting making them? And how can I start getting in the dating scene? And please do not say online dating I have tried it already. I just seriously need help with my situation because I think about this every day and I really start to get depressed sometimes. Anybody who replies to this post your advice is greatly appreciated thank you! I seriously need help,Depression
21442,21462,I feel like I cannot do anything right I had to get a new vision prescription and I tried to choose glasses that were just like the old ones but once I got them I realized they are too big for my head and it makes me so self conscious to wear them so I thought ok I will just get contacts but I cannot put them in even though I went there twice to try I just could not do it and now I am just giving up maybe I will wear my old glasses or just not wear any at all I do not know why this is so hard for me when it is such a small issue that anyone else could deal with easily but I just mess everything up it is horrible and it makes me want to never leave my room again I just cannot do it I feel so defeated by the smallest things,Depression

10442,10462,I do not want to but the scars speak for themselves. it is a filter and those who truly care would reach out. But there is no one who would reach out. I have cut since sophmore year of high school. I have had my scars since then and no one cares.I do not want to die. I do not want to hurt anymore. I just want to matter despite not mattering. I want to be desired not because I am making someone hapoy but for being me even when I am suffering. The only way I know how to reach out is to cut,Depression

24239,24259,Figure I can use this as a place to just make a diary or something. Idk maybe it helps maybe it does not. Anyways the whole purpose of my future posts here will serve as a diary to my life as a depressed person. I decided since my birthday is coming up soon and I have nothing to show for my life that I am giving myself 1 more year and then I am going on a vacation from this plane of existence. I do not have any friends and my parents are getting up there in age so I will be alone soon. No girlfriend and quite honestly it is going to take a fucking miracle for something to heal me and unfuck me up.it is not a doom and gloom entirely. Despite all of this I think there is a glimmer of hope if I can for lack of a better term focus like my life depends on it. If I can at least fix my job situation maybe I can muster enough to find something else but right now the issue I am depressed as hell. I do not think I can be around people and fake a positive interaction. I am on edge rn and I do not want to offend anyone and at the same time I hate this bullshit game of life where I am having to pretend people are friendly when in reality it is dog eat dog. Working is OK with me so long as I do not have to talk to anyone...at least if I work 247 I will not be entirely suffering in this lonely pit.I need to learn how to code and program as quick as possible. This seems like it is my last hope. If I can master this over the course of the year I might live to see 2023. Over the course of August I will be working 40 hours working out eating clean and studying. I am either going to survive this or I am going to die literally. there is nothing I can see saving me right now and I am losing all hope. This is my last shot.I really wish I did not have to feel this constant heartache and constant want to breakdown in tears. It sucks people are going to judge me because I cannot smile. It sucks that the only way out this is suffering through an intense type of personal hell to where you quite literally die and a new personality is either born or you fail and die.At least there is peace in knowing I choose when I go sorta. Day 1 Before we Begin ,Depression
21738,21758,I see it on social media and hear from people all of the time.By doing my depression went away and I have never been happier! You can do it too!The problem for me is that I have no idea how people do it. How do you start making it better. Where does the motivation come from? The drive? The discipline? How do people grow up and do the whole adulthood thing without feeling so shitty like I do? And even if they do feel shitty how do people do it anyways? I am job hunting right now. I am also pregnant I know not the most ideal situation but its the one I have found myself in but these feelings have been in the front of my mind and have consumed my thoughts for years now since my early teens. I left my last job due to feeling so stupid inadequate etc. I was not able and am still struggling to even leave my bed. I have never been able to keep a job longer than a year and I feel like such a failure. I feel like I need to be slapped into adulthood reality. If anybody has any advice from being in a similar situation or have words to help they would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance. I wish I was the healed version of myself already but I do not know how Ill ever get there.,Depression
22490,22510,it seems like every door I was trying to get to keeps closing and I have a terrible habit of cutting people off thinking when I get there ill meet people who will care about me. today I heard the school I had been praying to get into did not accept me. every time I put in the effort of trying to get better and find myself a new start out of this sadness I am once again let to see I will always be this way. the worst part is them telling me I did not get in because they did not have the tools for my ADHD. anyways anyone have any advice on how to not feel like giving up. why do I even try,Depression

8790,8810,Have been feeling depressed for quite a while. A lot of it has to do with my future goals and career just general anxiety and fear for the future. Will be entering college this fall and sorta feel weird about life. I have friends from hs but we do not really talk and I do not really have anyone in my life to talk to or want to talk to. I am just overall very neurotic about my future career. Ill be going down a very difficult and long career path that I believe objectively is one of the hardest ones out there medicine. I have been working really hard to get opportunities and building up my resume and stuff. While I am doing stuff I do like I do not feel happiness in life. There really is not anything that brings me joy. I also feel bad about my body. Sometimes I look at old photos and feel really bad about how I have gained weight. I have struggled with an ED before but I do not have ed issues anymore but it does not stop me from feeling bad about myself. And yea I just do not really feel anything and I do not know if I want to seek professional help. Like overall I feel like the road ahead is going to be very difficult and tiring and I just want a break but I feel like I have not been working hard enough as I have been doing a lot of comparing myself with others lately.Just wanted to get this all off my chest. Just want to write it out,Depression

12586,12606,Hi everybody. I was diagnosed with burnoutdepression 8 months ago. The 4 first months I only took StJon's wort. Then 3 months of Lexapro up to 20mg which helped me but I was too spaced out so my psy switched me to Effexor for 3 weeks which were terrible. Then I asked for Brintellix because of the side effects profile. 1 month in and I feel not better at all.My Psy wants me to try Prozac now. Do you guys have success stories with Prozac after failure with many others ? I am starting to feel hopeless.. 4th drug.. I am loosing hope,Depression
47465,47450,I feel stuck Hey everyone this is my first Reddit post lol. Anyways Im currently in my first year of college in a big city. Ive lived in a little town my whole life so the city itself is very overwhelming. I have adhd many forms of anxiety depression obviously lol and a slew of other mental disorders. I failed every class last semester mostly because I had a rough break up and I thought at the beginning of the semester Id do better. Which in a way I sorta did Ive been taking more notes and stuff but Ive really been working on myself as a person more and for a while a lot of my anxiety symptoms have been going away but today I had a talk with my parents where they mentioned how Id need to show them my grades and boom all of a sudden Im back in my shitty little hole of overthinking. And yet again it looks like I might fail. I feel that college isnt for me but if I do t do college then what will I do for work I dont wana live with my parents again they are great but I need my space. I feel that I cant be happy and get good grades I dont want to be who I am anymore I see a version of myself that I can be proud of but I need to work more towards it and I cant do that and keep going to school because its too expensive. And socializing is hard enough for me so if Im not on campus with people of similar age to me how will o ever find a person I want to spend my life with. I really dislike online dating but Im worried thats the only what Ill find someone if I leave here Im a hopeless romantic and I want to find someone in real life like a meet cute or whatever they are called. Not to mention that I feel like a huge disappointment because no line of work really speaks to me I want a job Ill be happy in and will allow me to like a comfortable life. I honestly have no idea what Id want for the future all I want is a comfy house with a spouse who loves me and Id be happy but I dont see that happening at all. Ive got 2 frequents and neither of them can just listen to my problems without giving me their own experiences wich is nice but I wish theyd just shut up and listen. I dont really want to die I just want to sorta fade out of existence like being in a dream. I know death isnt the right thing I dont want my family to have to burry me I just want these feelings to be quiet I want to know that somewhere down the line I have the safety and love I dream of every night. I really dont want the people I love to have to suffer but I cant tell if lifes worth it. I know every one says oh it gets better but Ive waited for it to get better for most of my life and guess what its not getting better. Ugh I really dont care if no one reads this I just need red to think someone has heard me. And hey if you got through all that I deeply appreciate you I hope you are having a better time than me lol.,Depression
17771,17791,For the last year and a half Id say I was self medicating with opiates. Lots if not so much fun every day I would wake up and need them. By 48 hours I was puking my guts out. I was not doing your regular boy or H as they say I was addicted to them round little blue M 30 fentanyl filled disastroids. And I also experimented with some of that G too. never was really a fan but eventually I said man I am going to lose everything I spent less time worrying about my loved ones and more time trying to find money for drugs and let us not forget the times the dealer was out and did not have any. I woke up one day and said fuck it. I am not doing this anymore spent 12 days hurling and had explosive diarrhea. It was hell. But something was missing. I got a sponsor and finally found out why the fuck I was self medicating for so long. Turns out I needed to see a psychiatrist. Long story short I got diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression. Many of my peers and even some family do not believe in my hardships. But I struggle every day just to smile. Even when my child is around. I just wonder when Ill feel better completely. If that will ever happen. Sorry for the bitching guys. But I just wanted to share this. Btw I am 3 months clean. Thanks for listening to my rant if you did. Please someone tell me it will get better. Even if you are lying. So here it is,Depression

7022,7042,It always feels so peaceful the first 5 seconds after waking up then it all goes to shit anyone else experience that? Last night I had someone over to help me take my mind off shit and it should have worked but it did not. I should be on top of the world but it does not feel that way. I just got pussy why am I so fckin empty? I am so fckin down. And now I feel like I have used someone and they do not deserve that. I miss my girl so fckin much. My mind keeps going to this picture of her laying with me eyes closed and I am just running my hand through her hair admiring how beautiful she is. Fck I miss how it felt when I kissed her. What do I do with this energy. I cannot get her back and I am left with this feeling that clearly I cannot put into someone else and be happy with it. It just sits with me waiting till I am alone so it can Fck me up. I cannot get through my head that it was not going to worl with her its like I am going through the grieving process again and I am at denial. This weighing too much on me. Pray for me you all its one hell of a morning Still empty,Depression

19170,19190,All my life has been the same. there is been people that I have had a relation with but in reality no one has genuinely ever take care about me about how I feel. No one has ever asked me how I feel in a real way.I have had helped people with money mental help school job... and what did I get in return? Nothing. Not even a simple Hello. People just do not give a shit about me. When others are being idiots everyone helps them or they just simply justify themselves in a hundred excuses. But if I start acting like a SOAB then everyone points at me or even worse they just ignore me the whole world acts indifferent to me.I am slowly dying and no one cares.

26553,26573,In the past 2 months we were constantly arguing starting again for a week then arguing again and again. it is got to a point where she told me that everything I said annoyed her. But now we are good again we are finally texting somewhat as we used to and began to see each other again. I had a mental breakdown one night and I told her that I would give everything just so it could be as it was before we started arguing she said that it will not happen again and that I need to get over it. I must note important I note that we were not dating at least not officially she never wanted a relationship but we spent many nights together and she called it something between friends and a relationship. Now to the reason I do not believe we are done. First off it is the second time she said we will be just friends and that she does not see anything more of it but still we ended up another two months being together after that. After she drunkenly told me that she too feels something to me but she is afraid so she lied to me she does not feel anything. And the second reason is that even though she told me we will be just friends she still comes over to my house on the same day she told me there will be nothing more to us and cuddle with me all night. So what do you think? Do I have a reason to not believe her in this or should I accept we are done? She told me we will not be anything but friends again but I cannot get myself to believe her. Is it justified by my side or am I just in doubt?,Depression

11037,11057,So hello and sorry if this post sounds whiny I will delete it if it does. I am 21m and for as long as I can remember my life has been miserable. I was bullied in school had almost no friends and so found solace in locking myself in my room and wasting time on the computer. This lasted from about 10 to 15. Since then I have spent my time regretting my life thus far and desperately trying to turn things around unsuccessfully. The whole situation with COVID and the lockdowns worsened my depression because I no longer was able to do anything of value with my time since I was stuck in an abusive household where everything I did was ridiculed. I feel old and broken.Anyway sorry for ranting but I needed to take all this off my chest. Depression stole my youth,Depression
14754,14774,I have been home for 2 years now basically isolated from the outside world. all I did during these last couple of years was cry my eyes out each and every night wondering if this pain and sadness I feel will ever go away. I feltfeel so alone.i had no friendsnot even online...no one to talk to....until I met a guy online. he was very sweet at the time...very religious and godly and at the time..I just wanted to feel loved..and less lonely....less sad....I wanted him to make me feel better instead he gave me an sti..that I am stuck with for life.he told me he did not knowand I stupidly believed him at the time but later on his friend told me that he had this sti way before meI feel so used...like trash. I hated myself long before all this..but now Its 1000 times worse...i cannot even stand to look in the mirror.. .I felt lonely before but now Its guaranteed that I am most likely going to die alone because who is going to want to be with me when I have this disease..I feel dirty and stupid for trusting him. knowing that he purposefully gave me this disease makes me feel worthless. I am isolated from the world with nothing but my thoughts for company. And my mind rn is the darkest place I can be.I hate myself..i hate who I am...I keep doing the same shit over and over... And I end up in the same place each time on the bathroom floor crying praying for the pain and this loneliness to go away. I feel so stupid .

I seriously feel like someone that cannot even achieve one little thing in his life without helpI cannot form good habits I cannot maintain my health I cannot keep the friendships I made in check I cannot learn new things I cannot even be a humanI am just trashLiteral human garbage that is only good for lying in bed and barely communicateI just wish I had a little gift for something because I am so lost without oneI feel it is already too late to save this life from being fully miserableI am so worried about what is to come because I cannot even shine a little in the one thing I enjoyed doing Why am I here?

11980,12000,I realized today that I have no more control over my concious. Maybe I never did. But I do not have the confidence or energy left to delude myself into thinking I have control over my life.I truly do not. I do not know who I am because I have spent the past four years never changing or trying anything new. Everything I have done was out of my own shortterm survival whether that may be work for school or trying to cope with stress through escapism.So here I am. I am 18 faced with reality and I do not know how to comprehend it. Once more I do not know myself. I never had the selflove to take care of myself during my high school years. I hated myself and destroyed a chance of forming an identity through my own fear and loathing.I do not know how to describe myself. I am many things but also absolutely nothing at all. Pretentious as that sounds it illustrates the tenuous grasp I have of my own self.I do not know who I am. I have vague ideas of who I want to be but I cannot do anything because I have no autonomy over my own feelings.I am in a constant state of inaction or drowning myself in escapism. I have college to worry about I still have not chosen my classes but how could I? I do not know who I am and any aspiration I have ever had I have never attained because of misfortune or inaction.So I give up. I have been severly depressed for the last seven month. Every day I wanted to die. But this past month its gotten better. Why? Because of escapism and leisure. Whenever I face reality I become depressed and scared. I can only live through other peoples stories and dream.I daydream all the time. I can never manifest anything.So I give up. I have no autonomy over this person I inhibit. They feel like a different person entirely from me. They will not relent with their bullshit bad habits and stagnation. My spirit is different from my person.I know I will never find selflove because that requires autonomy decision making and motivation. I have none. I feel deprived of anything.How am I even supposed to find a romantic partner if I do not know myself? I will always feel alienated from myself and others.Love is so beautiful but something I will never experience.I do not know where Ill be in a year let alone five but I will have made selfdestructive decisions like always. Whether they be big or miniscule I have always been too selfless. I do not mean that in a selfaggrandizing way but in a negative way. I do not feel good about myself.This makes me sound depressed and I probably am but the feeling is more akin to apathy. Why even try if I will NEVER be happy with myself. Always changing my mind always daydreaming. Every day I change my mind about who I want to be so I am nobody.I am just here for the ride for wherever my mind takes me. Down down down. I just will not feel the intimacy and love that others do.TLDR Anxiety killed me. Selflove and acceptance are vital to a good life. Life makes no sense. I do not understand my feelings anymore.,Depression
12080,12100,Typical 1st world country problems. My friends and family would say I have a good and stable life I would agree which just makes me feel extra guilty that I struggle just wanting to exist. I have everything I would every want and done everything I wanted to do and I know possessions and experiences do not give your life meaning and lasting joy I feel investing time in relationships family and altruism is what gives you joy. And maybe I am just being a lazy selfish bword but I just do not care enough to do that. I feel like I am just emotionally messed up I want to care I want to want but in my heart I feel nothing. What can I do to want again Wanting nothing from life,Depression
40203,40200,when all i did wa be there for her i drove fucking mile when her anxiety wa about to make her pas out when her parent wouldn t understand even when she left and there were pregnancy scare and thought of him leaving and now the whole town know me a a fucking rapist and stalker even though we only kissed once i know this is going to sound fucked up even worse but i genuinely can t take the lie no one should get away with doing that to someone else and i really don t think im going to let her i really really really really don t want to but it s all i can think about god help me,Depression
26812,26832,I finally went to see a psychotherapist after years of struggling and the conversation was really nice. I mean it was quite basic he asked me if I wanted to talk freely or if he should ask away and I chose the latter but still even just talking to someone who is nonjudgmental and not so reactive towards possibly disturbing things I might say was liberating. Right at the start I told him I was suffering from depression but after talking for just a bit he quickly crossed thatpossibility out saying that I did not have the most prominent symptoms being lack of sleep most importantly among other things. Apparantly sleeping well and too much is a disqualifier lol. In the end he did diagnose me with a reoccurent depressive disorder I dunno if that is the correct term in English on paper even though he said I am 'just' fatigued so I am confused. However the main thing I wanted to say is that I just do not know how I feel about this if I count on his words and not the final diagnosis?. I should feel relieved but if I am not depressed what makes me the mess I am? What makes me apathetic and hurt for no apparent reason? I cannot shoulder the responsibilty for 'failing' in life so far yet. it is too much without the 'excuse' of being depressed. To top it this was my biggest fear ever since I suspected I might be depressed in my teenage years.. That I might just be this way that everything I was going through was just me my personality. I finally embraced and accepted that I was depressed years along the way and often realized just how fucked up my mind is when others reacted strongly to random small things I said seeing in what dark place my mind was. Maybe I am just lazy and cannot grow the fuck up. I should have asked him if he was clearly diagnosing me with depression or what. Or is there a difference I do not know about? He also said that I should meet with a specialist for gastroenterology for my iron deficiency and emphasized that many women apparently suffer from the kind of symptoms I do just from the deficiency. I have experienced severe anemia before and I have had barely acceptable iron stats for years although I do take supplements whenever it dips too low and have that checked every year which my doctor for that does not take it half as serious... Anyway even though I came out confused I rode the high of having achieved seeking help which I have been putting off for ages. And as I said before just talking openly was really nice and I feel like I got lucky to actually like the first professional I met with having heard that many need to switch a few times before finding someone they click with. Even though I cannot go back there as there are no capacities in my city for the demand there is apparently. Please go seek therapy if you need it. Everybody can benefit from it not just us depressed folks. So yeah if anybody actually read this far have a nice daynight I wish you well. Just me rambling about my experience in one first therapy session,Depression

17521,17541,I told my mom about my ear problem. I have this problem where I would listen to songs in the highest volume I broke plenty of earphones. I just will not stop. It came to the point that my hearing is slowly decreasing and I would get really really dizzy sometimes but this time my speaker broke so I went back to putting my phone really near my ear and would walk in circles to listen to music and ofcourse it damages it but it is really hard to stop.My life is shit and just a mess. I live in my imaginations and I could only fully feel it when there is music playing. Low volume will not cut it.I am just so sad everybody in the shows I watch are just going through this exciting adventures and I cannot do anything because of quarantine and because of the limits my family has built around me.I want to stop but I am scared because I know I will not be happy and I will be alone. it will trigger my depression and I will panic and cry. I am starting to slowly change my ways but I guess I just also feel disappointed in myself because I talked about no more regrets and getting myself back together and yet here I am. Ruining my ears for a fantasy. All this weight that my parents keeps throwing at me and this regrets of the past and all those mistakes that matter and do not matter. they are all just killing me. Music is my escape it takes me to many amazing worlds and I am much more braver and cooler there.I just want to be free and happy. My self damage,Depression
14080,14100,i do not see myself as an older human. I do not see myself driving to pick up my children from school or seeing my significant other grow old along side me. I do not see the potential others have seen in me and it fucking sucks. It pains me to know that I do not see myself living a long and fruitful life looking back and reminiscing of times long gone by. I do not want to be living with this shitty illness that constantly battles with my well brain. Whether or not I want to in fact live another day of this. I fucking hate this thing that has taken very inch of my being. I just want to press pause and never return. the future,Depression

18651,18671,I 19 Mwas dumped by my high school sweetheart19 F a few months after graduating from high school which had me at my absolute worst due to covid and lack of social interaction I became totally dependent on my partner and became quite unhealthy physically in the process due to my hopeful lack of need to keep up appearances. I was in freshman year of online college at the time and I was completely unable to focus on anything school related because the thought of having to do that for the next four years by myself just made me want to avoid it altogether by just cutting it short. Along with not having any friends or any girls that I would even think of having a relationship with due to me being in a relationship during covid for over a year. It also did not help that I was very overweight and my self image was in the gutter. From that day I decided that I was going to lose my weight and get into the best shape of my life and gain my own confidence but the loneliness honestly became pretty unbearable at some points and I did not know that it was possible to experience things like that due to what is going on in your head. Thankfully I reconnected with a best friend that introduced me to trade school and being able to make money while actually applying current knowledge which I was a fan of because I did not have any desire to go through college I should add it was about 90 online so fast forward about 8 months later and I am working at a dealership and taking concrete steps to work my way up while attending a trade school. Through the process I lost the weight that I had put on throughout high school separate post on my profile and I decided that I was going to try my best to avoid just spending my time in my own thoughts because I am a very excessive overthinkeroveranalyzer. That I would instead only focus on the things that I am able to control at that moment to make myself better and improve for the future. Currently on meds and am starting to feel genuine joy in the little things in my life and am gaining appreciation for the things that I have as I work on building for whatever the future may hold. I saw a quote the other Day on Instagram that I thought was pretty good. Take care of yourself like someone you are responsible for Good luck everyone keep working on the things that you can control From heartbroken and depressed to at least mostly optimistic,Depression

Chronic illness heading toward complete inability to walk I feel physically terrible 247 unhelpful family social isolation child with health issues and disabilities who I will be caring for her entire life money problems etc. I just want some coping mechanisms some way to find moments of happiness sometimes. Some hope. I talked to her for an hour and at the end she said You definitely have depression. I would talk to your doctor about trying a different antidepressant. We can try a couple more therapy appointments but you have got a lot to deal with and I do not know how much I can do for you.Is it truly hopeless?

26708,26728,Welp I am back amp dk that ill ever truly leave as depression is never a battle you really just win for good its just managing it better but i digress.So i came home for the 4th July wknd to visit fam from my new FT warehouse job. Well this has turned out to be lamest most boring 4ths that i can ever remember. We litrally did nothing amp my fam treated it like just another day on calender. Normally the subdivision my fam lives in in country has a bbqburgers andor fireworks get togethersocial. Well I have noticed over the last few years as the neighborhood has grown it has pulled back more and more from neighborhood events. I guess more and more people are having their own fam amp friends over rather than inviting a select group from neighborhood. But whatever it is its really sapped fun out of holidays. This has been worst its been bc lately at least there is been an impromptu gathering rather than something planned. But this holiday absolutely nothing. I have never been more bored in my life well i have but amp now i have another 40 hours in warehouse to look forward to. And not to sound like spoiled brat but there was not even any pie for my visit there was but read on. I am living on budget at my new job amp really cannot so much as splurge on pie i try to stick to protein amp health bc of physical nature amp long hrs of job amp as such was looking forward to pie at home. There actually was a full chocolate pie but upon going for it was told its over a month old amp needs to be tossed. Epic salt in wound right there. So needless to say I am a but salty amp depressed after waisting a weekend amp not getting the necessary mental health serotonin recharge. Family,Depression
22889,22909,Ever since summer started I have been trying to get back into dating and it is been pretty unsuccessful. Only 1 real date that has not led to much more. In the midst of this obviously I have been feeling terrible. No one seems to give me the time of day and I have been feeling even more worthless than usual. This all led to a bit of a breakdown recently where I just cried for an hour on the floor feeling like I wanted to kill myself because no one seems to ever care about me like I want them to. Cut to yesterday and my friend calls me and basically brags about all the casual sex he is having now that he is moved to a new city. On top of that he is hitting it off with a women he is super attracted to. It like the world wants me to kill myself. What am I supposed to do with this? it is like life is laughing in my face by rubbing all the shit I want in front of me knowing I cannot get it. Life feels like it is mocking me,Depression

9306,9326,First time poster so excuse my grammar and format...I met my wife about 3 years ago fast I know but I was so happy. I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over not physically and I never cheated and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken hollow and cold. Like I am not the one who should get any form of pity...I felt so bad that I need to vent in some way...to feel...something. I cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...I guess that box cutter was not as dull as I thought. But the funny thing is I did not even feel it...I feel like I am regressing back into the person I used to be...the one who shuts out the world. Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here and I owe it to her to stay around for her. But I want it to end deep down...I keep thinking I should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. If I did not have my daughter I probably would have put a bullet in my head already.For all the mistakes I made...I am so sorry...I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could start over again. I was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. I am such a fool. I think I need to be medicated...but I just cannot afford that kind of thing right now let alone set professional help.Anyway...I just wanted to rantvent...thanks VentingI lost everything I ever wanted due to my own mistakes,Depression

7061,7081,Hello RedditI met someone recently on a dating app and we have been going steady for a week now. We are on different parts of the country and everything has been virtual. I enjoy his company and I think the feeling is mutual. The problem is there is this growing nagging feeling on the back my head that everything is bound to turn bad. I am already imagining all kinds of breakup scenarios in my head. there is this occasional feeling that he might be growing uninterested as time goes by and the fact that my brain tends to misinterpret his every word against me is not helping.The feeling is so crippling I do not feel butterflies anymore every time we talk. I feel fear.Will this ever go away? This is my first legitimate date and I would hate to screw this up. He does not know about my depression and I do not plan on telling him so big a skeleton as early as now. How do I possibly deal with this? Thank you for any advice Dating with depression,Depression
17058,17078,My life has been hard and full of abuse and I realize looking back neglect. The one thing that always bright me joy was creating art. But not anymore. Not it feels so pointless like I am putting time and effort into something that does not even matter. I am not that good of an artist and I would I am this alone and have no one because those who should love me only want to use me out hurt me or make everything about themselves? It does not matter. I have no rain to paint because I have no reason to keep going Art feels pointless now,Depression

13082,13102,if anyone feels like people are mocking you or mocking others for looking 'miserable' or looking 'sad' all the time. do not listen to them.your feelings are valid just as much as them. also remember as soon as they suddenly feel the way you were feeling they will not be so quick to judge the way you are feeling the next time. you are allowed to be saddepressed,Depression
12675,12695,I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I also have severe anxiety. I feel out of control right now. The intrusive dark thoughts are eating me up and I do not know what to do. I do not know what approach to take. I am scared to give medications a chance because back in 2013 I went through a very low point and was prescribed xanax. I took xanax everyday for three years. At first it helped. It really did. It helped me get out of the ditch I was in but as you all know Xanax is a short term drug. I became dependent on it rather quickly. Weaning myself off of it was the best and hardest thing I had ever done. I was also prescribed Lexapro. I took it one day and a couple hours later I was a wreck. Dizzy like you would not believe. I could even stand. I had to miss work. I gave it up after that. Ever since then I have not been on a single drug. I also did not have health insurance so there is that too. I am in a better position now though. I have health insurance. I am working a full time job. Things are better. But I cannot shake how I feel. It has been so bad lately and I cannot breathe. Life should not be this way. I should not wake up and immediately think of negative things. Hateful dark thoughts. Its miserable. I am constantly anxious. My heart is always racing. I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I have slowly become scared to leave the house. I need to think about it and prep myself beforehand. Its exhausting.I guess my question is what steps should I take? I was thinking of making an appointment with my PCP on Monday. Should I be open to medications again? I am so scared of becoming dependent on those things again. Should I try therapy? How do I cope with my thoughts? I do not exactly have a strong support system. I feel like I do not have much longer and I need to control this now. I am losing hope and also my mind. This should not be how life is right?,Depression

I just want to feel. Everything is numb,Depression

8489,8509,Hello. After having a quite long psychotic episode I have been struggling with really bad depression. Even now when my meds do not naturally repress the happy processes in my brain I still struggle a lot.

19735,19755,I will not go into my whole story but the basic details are that I am a 35 year old guy homeowner about 10 years into my current career career not job homeowner creative person new firsttime father... Since 11 or 12 I have experienced depressive episodes and severe depressive symptoms. it is only gotten worse as I have gotten older taken on more responsibility been burned more and more by people repress my heartdesires to live a more fulfilling life and travel and take risks etc. I have done more or less all of the conventional things like therapy tried multiple drugs I even was in a yearlong clinical trial for an experimental drug for treatmentresistant depression etc. For a while I was able to travel for 46 weeks during the winters and I did that for three winters in a row and it was probably the happiest I have been in years. But despite all of the good things happening in my life lately I tend to always dwell on the really negative things all of the trauma I have experienced all of the devalue and discard the manipulation and cruelty of others the sense of worthlessness and the morose sense that nothing really matters and that we will all be forgotten one day. For the last 23 years I have been really really struggling to finally find something that works. Suicidal ideation is more or less always there but just at different intensities and volumes depending on what is happening and how I am feeling. I have a lot to live for right now and want to be here to be a part of my daughter's life but I have not had much if any success with mood drugs talking to my primary care doctor seeing a psychologist etc. I feel like I almost have to do something dramatic like check myself in somewhere in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan and finally be taken seriously. I have always been afraid of the costs and possible intervention from policeauthorities but at this point I have lived like this for so long I cannot imagine living another 1520 years like this. I hate that major depression is viewed more as a weakness and not a chronic condition that can and does kill people. Has anyone else done this? What have peoples experiences been like with hospitalization or inpatient treatment?,Depression

17824,17844,I never just sit home and wallow in my own sadness and filth. I do all the things people say you should do when you feel down I have a job I workout a lot I eat fairly healthy I have goals I strive to achieve but none of it means anything because I am lonely. Not only in a romantic type of way but in general. I basically lost my only two friends I could trust and confide in I cannot trust my family with my words I have no one and nothing and its torture I have no real friends and I am not happy no matter what I do,Depression
23502,23522,I feel like fucking Sisyphus repeating the same cycle over and over again never making a single inch of progress. I feel a few brief days of clarity where I feel like life might just be worth living and almost like I am capable of dealing with my own thoughts. But it piles up so so fast. As soon as I let one negative thought in I am drowning within a day. I have been a complete and utter failure this year moved out so I was not a financial burden on my family. But I am now costing them more than I was when I was living at home. I do not have any reason to feel this way but I am just so tired of existing. I do not know what to do at this point I have been struggling with depression since I was 12 going on 7 years now self harm for about 6. But no matter how hard I try every single day I think about cutting or ending my life and I do not feel like Ill ever get a break. I always thought I would be dead by 18 and now that I have made it I do not know what to do. I do not see myself growing old having a future I have just always thought I was either going to kill myself or OD. Any time I relapse I just see this sadness in my families eyes they love me and this is the problem. I cannot bear letting them down anymore. I do not know what to do. Every single time I feel like I am getting better I slip again,Depression
21736,21756,Just had a fun night with friends. I had alot of fun and we drunk and hung out for hours. Now I am home sad lonely and feel like a burden to everyone. I have always struggled with silence I hate it and have to fill it and I definitely talk too much and over insist on sharing my opinions.here is the thoughts I jotted down before making this postI talk too muchI share too muchI push my opinionsI do not accept social ques to shut up I always NEED to air my realizationsobservations I am not confident in my opinions I am not confident in my social skills When I get home alone and analyze my behaviour I want to die kill myself I feel like everyone tolerates me and would be happier if I was deadI imagine them upset if I died and either feel validated by their sadness or... pained by how relieved they would be to have me gone. Anyone else feel this way? I do not know what to do. I desperately need to socialize and miss my friends when I do not see them. But everytime I socialize with my friends I go home to these feelings. It almost feels worst than sitting at home doi g nothing alone and with no one. I do not know how to keep going on like this. I do not want to be alone... But these feelings scare the fuck out of me and I literally want to die to make them stop... I am at a loss and do not know how to keep going on like this.I love my friends. they have never indicated that I annoy them but I feel as if I KNOW I do I am ADHD and absolutely cannot stop myself from talking as soon as I let me guard down. I do not know how to continue living like this... Depressed after spending time with friends,Depression
21231,21251,it is not going to be focused on something because I cannot focus on anything so yeah. I am 19 now. I feel like I am losing my mind. I feel empty all the time so I eat too much and buy stuff. I am going crazy. I cannot think anymore cannot concentrate. My memory is not working and my body is not what it used to be. I hate myself. I constantly look at myself in the mirror and judge the way I look. I try to diet everyday but soon after I break down. I am hungry I am thirsty for that sweet taste of food. that is the main thing in my mind all the time. that is what will fill me up when I feel down. So I eatBut then I feel worst because I gain fat and I hate myself more.When I sit in groups I do not understand what is going on. I ask questions and then ppl say I talk too much. But when I do not say anything no one notices me. I am always the one out. The one ignored. The weird crazy psychopath one. They call me psycho as a joke but it is not funny anymore. Yeah I get hyper and energetic sometimes. I do not know how to deal with all those energies that somehow I feel empty again so guess what I do? Eat.What is wrong with meWhy am I like thisI keep thinking about the days I was 5 yo and I was happy and hopeful. When my parents were young and everything and everyone were happier. Today there is mostly sadness. I am so tired of all the thoughts and feelingsI just want to sleep and not wake upI just want a shot that will make my mind quiteI do not want to be here nor there I do not want to be Sorry I am here to vent.. and I do not know why I post this but I guess I just cannot keep my feelings for myself anymore,Depression
18866,18886,Sometimes I just want to give up. The reason why will sound so petty and hilarious to you ha ha. I am a 24 year old man. I am a virgin. this is a problem for me not because I am desperate for an orgasm upgrade my right hand does a decent enough job but because I want validation that I am worth someone is time and that they will get that close to me. I want to love someone and know them intimately and vise versa. I do not think people who have had a partner actually understand this. they are always like its just sex. Uh no for me its a symbol of acceptance into humanity a symbol of love and acceptance. Sure my mom loves me. She has to. The trick is to convince a total stranger that you are worth something. In my eyes I am a loser and pathetic. I cannot tell you how painful that is. And to get to the point I feel like I will take so long to recover. I have allot on my plate. A court case drug addictions social isolation depression unemployment a bunch of nasty scars that are obviously selfinflicted learning disabilities. Need I mention a brain that is fantastic at compiling excuses. I feel like a disgusting and unnatractive wretch. I am sure you can understand that from what I listed. But also please understand that I am desperate to reach out and have someone tell me I am worth spending time with. At my lowest most loserish point I have become more desperate for affection than I have ever been in my life. Shit luck that is. And I cannot help but think I will be into my thirties by the time I have focused on myself long enough to fuck. And then? Well Ill get to fuck ugly thirty year olds. There it is there is the petty point I have been tryuing to get to this whole time. To be honest I like to look at 1822 year olds young people that is who I am attracted to. And I have squandered my opportunities to be with those people. And I am never going to be bezos and be able to pay for peoples affection adn I do not think I am going to look like arnold schwarznegger either. So I have missed out. Also I am drunk right now. Sour grapes,Depression

7188,7208,i do not know if its depression last year i used to love studying and did it for around 8 hours on top of school because i just enjoyed it . maybe its burnout but now i cannot even study for 10 minutes without feeling like its not worth it. this is the course i wanted to study my entire life. i wake up in the morning full of anxiety and have to calm myself down because the thought of university is too much. maybe its the fact that i was anticipating life to be good at this stage and for me to be happy that now that I am not it is heartbreaking. i will never drop out of school but i have considered suicide because staying does not seem worth it. I have a bf and a loving family but seeing them no longer brings me joy either. but i want to know if i should visit a doctor and get on medication or should i just wait it out for a few more months. not worth it,Depression
25504,25524,Idk how to start this but I am 19 and I have been depressed since about 1415. I thought it was just a phase but I got a plumbing job which is what I went college for and wanted to do since I left school and the depression never went away they ended up letting me go of the job which did not help. My whole family knows about my depression but they do not know how bad it is should I tell them or try and figure it out on my own? I am also in the process of also quitting weed how much will this help my depression? The doctors have tried putting me on anti depressants but I said no should I take them? Sorry for all the questions. Help????? I have no idea what to do,Depression

22023,22043,I do not know. I tried hard to find at least something positive in life but each day I want to live less and less. I do not have things like girlfriend good friends loving family interesting job or meaningful hobbies to proceed with. I tried hell a lot but never found neither happiness nor meaning. I do not want to live like I do now and I see no ways to change it. Why should I live if despite all efforts I have neither happiness nor meaning nor companionship?,Depression
14369,14389,I never really enjoyed my life but it was manageable. My father is a royal asshole my mother did not intervene. My behavior was to blame according to them it never occured to them it was a response to their shitty parenting. Of course i was bullied daily which did not stop for about 12 years.In all this i was alone and i broke 8 years ago. Major depression. I was not able to continue my education. I tried working but cannot deal with the pressure. The things I used to love are empty and unfullfilling. I have been to all kinds of therapy but nothing works. By now at least i know what is wrong with me chronic childhood trauma.My last resort is going to a mental hospital but if that fails i just do not know what to do anymore.I am a 26yo man and I feel like i never even started living but only ever survived. it is taken 8 years of my life with no prospect of getting better... I am close to just giving up.,Depression
12715,12735,I am a 21yo male. All my life I have been your typical shy guy do not go out that much stays at home playing games do not have many friends kind of weird when it comes to social stuff etc.This year somehow I met a girl and we have been dating for almost half a year. I am so happy and our relationship is pretty solid but I have discovered that I have a lot more stuff to work on than I thought.What I notice lately is that I am always thinking about her or the fact that I want to spend time with here but I am very harsh on myself about that I say to myself that I should not be so mellow. Because of this sometimes I get really sad and mad at myself and I feel like I have 0 energy.I know myself pretty good and try to always distract myself doing any of my hobbies but sometimes I just have literally 0 willpower. I find myself laying in bed and I just cannot get myself up.I have been in therapy for the past few months not just for this but sometimes I feel like I just can'tIt's pretty frustrating How to keep functioning even when you have 0 motivation?,Depression
39186,39183,my stomach is hurting all day from anxiety i have constipation what can i do to help this breathing is hard and it feel tight so i can t even breath properly no matter what so trying to breath properly wouldn t help because it feel impossible when my stomach and chest feel tight,Depression
11043,11063,I hate to sound lazy but there is just so much to do...and for what? You have to study or work have to maintain a good job or grades have to have a sufficient social circle a relationship be healthy work out maintain hobbies..its just too much for me. I have hope for the future I have goals but there is just so much effort to reach them. Last year I had motivation and I tried for months on end with meditation and exercise and journaling and reflection and I fell off this year because it was not working for me. It was all that effort for nothing. Whenever I work up the courage to go seek out a friend or romantic interest I have anxiety so its a hard thing to do and I need to psych myself up for it it barely ever works out and once again my effort was wasted. So I am here thinking about my plans for the summer working out trying to meet new people and getting my license I failed earlier this year after months of learning I have adhd and I wonder how am I supposed to muster up that effort to even have a chance at success?Every day for me is just finding different things to keep me entertained and its not like I am content doing nothing but to get out of that and live a better life I have to put in a ton of effort that is not even sure to pay off. I am mentally exhausted. I feel like I physically do not have the capacity to fight and persevere through stress anymore. Its just too much effort.,Depression
19574,19594,Got a job a few weeks ago and I have been on every single day. I was unemployed for 5 months prior and hated the monotony of it all. Also I got out of an abusive situation moved and started the job right away. Emotionally I am not coping well. I have reached a new stage in my depression where its loss of self and I cannot wrap my head around this. I do not want to be here but whenever I express this to my mother who is the one and only person I have I am burdening her and using it as a manipulation tactic. I do not know what else to do.

20190,20210,I guess looking back on it my parents are narcissistic and a big reason I am the way I am most of my life i spent struggling with how i feel and i guess that is not changed today i still do not know who i am I feel stupid asking questions and just being a normal person because when I was younger or hell even now. My parents will try and invalidate what I say. And if were together and I say something there is always something to say back or some remark. And I have just learned to live with it. And after 2 failed relationships. And. In and outside worh friends and just sitting by myself I just feel alone and feel I surround myself with people who do not get me or just hate me because the way I am I have adhd and I suffer from it heavily even with medication I just idk I feel alone and for the past 2 or so years I have just not felt the same I find it hard to be happy but cannot afford a therapist it is a on and on cycle that I just wish I could get out of. I want to be happy make other people happy but with current situations I find it difficult everyday to be happy Just feeling a little down,Depression

15424,15444,I am in college part time and working part time. My job is miserable and I hate college but I do not think I could handle working minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life. I do not think I could handle working any job for the rest of my life. I hate the thought that I am going to work all my younger years away for a job that I probably will not enjoy just to survive. It makes me want to kill myself this is not a world I want to live in. Once I get out of college nothing is going to change. I am just going to have to work a fulltime job and try to take care of my own house. I feel like I will not ever have free time. I do not really have any hobbies anymore since I spend all my time working when not doing that I am cleaning the house.

23534,23554,It all started when I have this dream basically I spawned in a beach and I had to participate in a taekwondo competition but before I went to the bathroom and I get lost but in the sea I see that one of my friendsvirtual friends has make a documentary about interned friends and I was not included then I retured to the taekwondo thing and when I was about to participate I wake up. This was bascially because one of my friendsmy friends girlfriend we do not know anything about her since october and she was nice and yesterday I was checking the profile and she made a post in august where it saidthanks for keeping up with me or something like that and she tagged everyone but me I think everything is my fault because she probably suicided but at the same time I think its not I mean I am very insecure about what to say and what to think I always regret the idea of being me the culpable but I live with the feeling it is probably me at adolescence or that I am very open to people and the friend that make a documentary has being my friend for more than a year and a half but the thing that scares me is the fact that she is under 16 I do not know his boyfriends age but he is always saying for exampleShecan you give me a hamburger? HeI am not giving you anything and she is like ok I mean I do not know if they hang out like that or it is just me being an entitled parent I never liked to swear actually I never swear and in spanish language we have dichos dichos are like I killed 2 birds with one stone a word is enough to the wise well we have a dicho that says it is not your work to fix or solve someone elses life because you are ot enjoying your life and I am like yes but no I think it is only the adolescence because when I discovered one of my favorite streamers I felt a little bit better but with the dream I remembered that actually my life has suckI am thinking I am worth nothing probably because the people around my life suck too I wanted to try basetball when I was 5 and they told me I was too young I wanted to try robotics when I was 6 but I was too smallthey tought I could not read lmao my mom says that I am smart but smart in what I really do not know my purpose I had suicidal thoughtswhen I was 11 and now I do not want them to get back but it is inevitable I just hate myself for being to lazy probably that is why people discriminate me because I am a fat upset boy that wants justice and is doing whatever to get it some of my friends suck too I mean when they are sad I write the whole bible to make them feel better and they say ok you are so wise thank you and that is all but when I am feeling sad they just do not say nothing they even not congrat me on my birthday they prefer the guy that insults them than me I do not know what I am doing wrong every step I give 1 is correct and 3 are not correct I just want to live a quiet life I want to be accepted I want to stay well LITERALLY ONE OF MY ONLINE FRIENDS PREFERS A GUY THAT SAYS SEX WITH DOGSAND HAS KNOWN HIM FOR A MONTH THAN ME THAT I ALWAYS GIVE COMFORT AND HAS KNOWN HER FOR 2 YEARS probably I am taking social media so serius but they always say omg you are so smart but AND WHAT?

22685,22705,I have had a friend since middle school we just graduated and she is been depressed since I met her. She has terrible trauma that is is most likely the root of all of her mental issues and she has said if she were to unpack everything she would need to be admitted to a psych ward. In high school her mental health became much worse she became addicted to Benadryl and almost commit suicide twice. She told this to her teacher and Ms. J told the counselor and her parents and nothing happened. About 6 months ago she went to a therapist who said she was not depressed after being told she tried to kill herself. Recently her depression has changed she has periods of extremely deep depression and the suddenly she will be the complete opposite she went from planning her suicide to throwing her plan away within a few hours. We were driving the other day and she said she jokingly said I might be having a manic episode. I looked up bipolar depression symptoms and she has almost every symptom and the description of it matches her behavior to a tea. I do not know how to help her because she laughs it off when I try to talk to her. Is there anything I can do to help her? I have a suicidal friend and I do not know how to help her,Depression

17442,17462,My councillor has suggested they might help as I seem to have a biological imbalance. I have been offered them before and I stopped after two because they made me feel ill.They worry me. The whole crushing of your libido aspect. I came out of a relationship. Sex was important to me and though I am not with anyone right now I do not see being sexually numbed as something that will help my depression.And I have seen it from the other side too. My ex and I had an amazing sex life. It was probably 80 of our relationship. And while that is not good. When she went on the drugs for her own problems she did not want sex with me as much. A lot of the spark just died. And it hurt. I am scared that being on these things will kill my chances of finding a partner honestly. And I think its a choice between something that helps but also hinders my life.I just cannot make a choice. Any advice or anyone else who feels this way? Deciding if anti depressants are for me.,Depression
8905,8925,Its not easy wearing a mask all the time. Sometimes I carry it well other times I cannot even find the strength to put it on. Everything is fine as long as I wear it but the minute it starts to slip I am no fun to be around I cannot even open up about the way I truly feel because nobody really understands. I do not enjoy doing anything. Literally. I am just on autopilot in a constant state of numbness. Its like I am just a ball and chain for my wife to carry around. Of course she is tired of it who would not be. She does not understand the constant pain I am in. She does not understand that she is the only reason I am even keeping on going. Opening up to her just causes her pain because I know she just wants me to be happy with her. The thing is though I would not be anywhere as happy as I am now without her. she is my world.

18428,18448,Hello allI just need to vent a bit about my current situation and hoping I can get advice or a simple ear to listen.On my birthday in late May I was visiting a friend and had an accident in his home. I fell down the basement stairs busted my head open and was barely breathing. I thought this was one of my best friends but he never once visited me in the ICU or hospital and now we rarely speak. Its breaking my heart.3 days after being home from ICU I received a call that my grandfather passed away. I still am incapable of processing this.I am currently on disability leave from work and I get paid 60 of my salary. It has been almost 2 months but nothing has improved. All day long I am driven around to doctor appointments and feel like a helpless child. I need to go back to work as soon as possible and cannot fathom being able to handle my usual workload.My anxiety and depression is the worst its ever been. I thought it was awful in the past but I was wrong. I cannot sleep until 5am because I am paralyzed with fear. Nothing makes me happy. I have no interests and cannot do basic chores because I simply do not care. People love me but I feel like I am not good enough for that love. I recently switched to a new psychiatrist right after the accident. My previous one was okay but I was hoping to find someone who understands my needs better. Well the appointment today with the new psych went terribly. She decided to cut my antianxiety rx to 13 of my prior dosage which I have been taking for many years upped my mood stabilizer even though she is aware that I have tried this in the past and higher doses make me very dizzy and I am struggling with dizziness as a side effect of my brain injury already. Then she added a drug which gave my boyfriend horrible tremors and ticks. I told her all of this made me incredibly uncomfortable and she did not care. I had to call the pharmacy right away and tell them not to bother filling the prescriptions and to take her name off my file. The last thing I need from all of this is to raise flags and look like a doctor hopper! I am waiting to get back in with my previous psychiatrist.Bills. More bills piling up every day. I have a huge stack and can barely pay rent with my 60 salary.I live alone and today was the worst I have had in years. I am not planning to harm myself but am struggling with a reason to continue living. I was happy before the accident and now I feel like an impostor in my own life.

22731,22751,I confided in my husband that I feel trapped in my existence and that I think everyone except my son would be better off without me but he needs me so I am here. My husband then started yelling and cussing at me screaming at me to man up and grow some balls and yelled repeatedly to me to leave him and go away and called me fucking pathetic. I cannot even describe how alone and depressed I am and how much worse that made things and reinforced all my beliefs about my useless sad existence. I confided in my husband and it made things even worse,Depression
7456,7476,I know...the title sounds annoying and desperate...but I really needed to tell someone anyone. This is probably a result of PMS...but I really do want someone to lay in bed and cry to. I am so touch starved and lonely. I have felt this way for years. I just want someone to hold me and reassure me. To comfort me through all the shit I go through. Sometimes the loneliness gets so bad and I cry alone in my bed. Sometimes I wrap myself around a pillow and have to pretend it is someone a boyfriend for comfort. This is one of those times. Ik after this I will get up brush myself off and get on with my life like I always do. I have to. But it would just be so nice to have someone hold me and whisper sweet nothings to me. To feel his warm embrace and his fingers play with my hair. To make me feel like I am worth protecting. Like I am important to at least someone. I am always fighting with myself internally. Ik that I should not have to depend on anyone for happiness. That I should be my own independent woman or whatever. And it is not like I am going to settle for someone who does not treat me right....and I know life is not all about love and relationships....but I just...I love feeling WANTED by somebody. Maybe that makes me needy and codependent but I just love it so much. I love being praised and spoiled with love. It hurts when I see other people living the life I want to live. Like I am happy for them...but it hurts bc I want that so badly. I want to be somebody is baby too. somebody is world. I want to be special to somebody too. Honestly it does not help that I might have daddy issues....Anyways I needed to get that off of my chest. Thanks for reading it all if you have gotten this far. lt I want a boyfriend so badly right now,Depression
17506,17526,There is too much work and energy on keeping my appearance up. It felt like somebody took that away from me and I helpless in the matter. Being stinky and smelly feels like I something I deserve. Especially around my armpits and genitalia it just feels like its meant to be unclean and I am forced to keep it that way. Like I am not allowed to be clean at all. A part of me knows I have not kept myself clean in days nor have I changed my clothes but I just do not care. It is a cycle of guilt there is no thinking about cleaning its just getup and go. I do not plan on changing or taking a shower today. In fact I will probably will not for a while as it seems like something I do not deserve and its a redundant to me. I have not brushed my hair or teeth in five days,Depression

16022,16042,I recently came to the realization that there are two different people in me. there is one guy that can genuinely make people smile and laugh make people feel comfortable heard and important. That guy is kind of awkward and a little nerdy and goofy but hes earnest and loves to smile and see others smile. That I have been told makes me vulnerable and real.Then there is the other guy. Hes dead serious. He does not speak to others and does not want to be spoken to. He waits for those closest to him to hurt him as has happened in the past. He is immensely lonely and feels like a burden to others. Sometimes he indulges in alcohol and food to numb the pain of being inside his own head.That second guy has been winning lately. If I could describe my depression this would be it. It feels like there is someone else inside of me and I know that it is not who I truly am. I feel like a burden on my SO and while I love her I am too hurt by life and loved ones to expect her to always be there for me.It sucks. I know that treating depression involves recognizing these sorts of things but I still feel like living with it is an unbearable cross to bear sometimes. I feel like I am losing my smile,Depression

19720,19740,Crosspost I do not know where to start. This is going to be very long and I do not expect anyone to read it.ampx200Bwhat is been weighing heavy on my mind since I woke up this morning is AM. Those are his actual initials and that is really all he is to me. And bad memories. I have nightmares regularly with him in them. I cannot help but want to ask him if he is sorry 23 years later. I could not believe my eyes the day I found cp on his second phone. You may ask yourself second phone? then glance up at the red flag. Yeah I have a hard time not blaming myself for falling in love with someone I can clearly see was a terrible person in hindsight. But I did.I told myself for over a year afterward that I would never be capable of loving someone so endlessly and freely. Part of me still believes that. Part of me knows that is the grooming and abuse still doing its job. However none of me genuinely feels bad for myself. I wanted to die before I met him and I want to die now. I wanted to die when I was with him too. A rapper I like said it best I still want to die but got someone to do it with.I think what makes it so difficult is that we were junkies in love. Spending all my money on drugs of choice. Being in love on drugs cannot compare to doing it sober. I still cannot figure out if he knew what he was doing or if he was just so fucked up that he cannot see what he did.For the sake of TLDR I think the one story I will share is the day he was trying to convince me to give him back his second phone. For context this was directly prior to the purge on Tumblr. Before the purge in general.I had found cp one time prior around Christmastime living in a motel but I was so deeply disgusted and disturbed and also literally was not trying to invade his privacy that he easily convinced me it would never happen again and it was a onetime thing that he felt extremely guilty for. I have to excuse myself here and say I was extremely drugged up and not thinking clearly.The next time I found it was after we moved into an apartment and signed a lease. I was looking through his phone and found way more evidence than would have been needed to convict him. I told him and took his phone and almost always kept it on my person. He played nice for a couple days trying to get me not to go to the police. Which worked. What also worked was the day he blew up. He told me he felt like I was keeping the phone instead of getting rid of it to spite him. I told him I was not sure what I wanted to do yet. He practically begged me to give it back to him. So I took it and threw it into the dumpster in our apartment complex. I told him if he wanted it he could climb in there and go get it. I am not sure if he did. I would not put it behind him.ampx200BThe other thing weighing heavy on my mind is SW. Also his actual initials. Also only bad memories. Sometimes I have nightmares about him too. This one is hard because I blame myself entirely for it even though I advocate that teenagerschildren are not at fault if an adult takes advantage of them even if they initiate it or think they want it. The age difference was about 1012 years but the exact number escapes me. I was a minor at the time.I think he was the first one who ever told me to call him daddy. I do not have any words in my head when I think about what happened it is really only flashes of what I can remember and what I felt. I feel disgusted by my former self for allowing SW into my home and letting him do those things to me. I remember the smell of cheap beer and menthol cigarettes on his breath. I remember the process of letting him get away even though my mother contacted the police. I remember his girlfriend messaging me on facebook some time later asking what SW said was wrong with her. That is so sad.ampx200BWhat it boils down to is this after SW I attempted suicide. I would have succeeded if what I hung myself from did not break. After AM I never properly attempted but today I am surprised that my recklessness and inconsideration for my own life did not kill me.Today I weigh a lot on how easy it would have been to commit suicide after AM. No one cared about me I did not talk to family or friends and I had nothing at all going for me in my life.Today it is only hard to do it because of my responsibilities and shame. there is not much more to say here. Of course there is also the fact that my boyfriend and family would have to cope with it but some of that ties into responsibilities instead of actual guilt. It would be easier if I was high and I just want to say fuck it and go buy drugs. But I do not know what my boyfriend would do. Part of me literally does not care because he kind of treats me like shit too.I literally do not want to put in the effort of getting better. I do not want to have to find a counselortherapistpsychiatrist. I do not want to have to try different medications when being high is so much better than being happy. I do not want to talk about what happened to me because there is nothing I can do to make it not happen and because I cannot fucking kill the people who hurt me the most. As far as I know too they are fine. they are fucking fine. And I am still struggling to be a person. I just wish there was a switch that could make it better or just never happen in the first place so I did not have to put in the effort to get better for things that weren't my fault. I should have killed myself after AM then I would not have to hurt my best friendboyfriend and my family I have gotten closer to since I got sober. I wish I never got sober. I wish I let him kill me. I should have killed myself when it would have been easy,Depression
13460,13480,I just want to die but I cannot. I know the family I do care about would be shattered so I cannot. I have been telling myself for years that I would stay alive at least for my nephew but fuck I am not good enough to take care of myself. Everyday I think Fuck what am I going on for? I wake up everyday to go to a job I hate with terrible coworkers and management just to drink or smoke my days off away to avoid the negative feelings. I have gotten to the point where nothing can numb how disatrisfied I am in myself and my circumstances.. When I apply myself to do more I just lose and lose. Been trying to get a new job or skill for awhile but Covid is slowing down opportunities good enough to pay the bills. I get teased and get to 2nd or 3rd interviews just to be told no. Happened 6 times this month and I am just like why am I even trying to improve.it is hard to motivate yourself when you believe you are garbage that you do not deserve to be content with life. I have lost joy in doing almost everything I used to. I do not read as much as I used toshould I do not find games fun anymore stopped hitting the gym from the lack of passion I do not go out much due to the lack of money. Even eating food has lost most of the joy it should normally bring a person. Nothing ever seems worth the effort and when I try again and again I do not get results. I know I should not just give up but at the same time when you are waking up everyday to suicidal thoughts and going to bed with them for years.. I just want everything to end already.

20677,20697,Its been a year since I left college due to a lot of shit happening in my life. When the pandemic first began I resorted to online classes. It was not so bad at first. And I was going to continue in the fall 2020 but in the past years summer my grandfather died. It was hard for me to process all of this. I could have kept going but I choose not to.Deep down I really want to be someone in life. I want to continue with my studies and be successful again. I was a straight A student when I first attended community college and graduated with top honors. After transferring to uni my first semester there sucked. I was struggling despite my efforts the advisors did not really cared what classes I took and even misguided me on the classes I was not suppose to take etc. I left that school because I knew I was not happy so I left and went back to my community college to make up for my poor performance. That was all before the pandemic began.My depression has been holding me back. I do not know who I want to be but I am willing to work hard again. Even one of my old teachers who I keep in touch with agrees that I should dust myself off and move forward with who I want to be. How do I figure out what I want to be and leave the past behind? I quit school over a year ago due to death in the family admits the pandemic. Am I failure to leave school behind? Could I ever go back and figure out who i want to be?,Depression

20776,20796,how is life worth living while there will be always miseries no matter who you are and why people are so afraid of death while death is the end of miseries when you day it is just so simple there is no More misery no more stress no more sadness so what is negative in being a dead person what is negative in commiting a suicide people are so dumb nowadays all what we care about is money looking good being the most successful person on earth that is all what we care about while in reality yes maybe if you were Rich and healthy then Maybe you are happier than other people but that is does not mean that does not mean that this person is the happiest person on the planet that does not mean there is no misery and no stress in this person's life so like I said no matter who you are there is always miseries. choosing between life or death does life really worth living,Depression
20196,20216,i was doing very well for some time now. probably since early spring. no clue what set me off. i have not been enjoying my new job much but that is not a new feeling took the job in january. i woke up tired today. as the day went on my ability to focus on work and maintain my motivation to get through the work day quickly deteriorated. by dinner i had no plans of eating managed a protein bar at lunch. this is not usual normally i am hungry and when depressed i binge eat often. but my boyfriend decided to cook the meal i was meant to make us so i did eat a healthy dinner. i then laid down in my made bed. i did not get up again. i have things to do around the house but i cannot be bothered. they do not matter to me in the moment but at the same time they do. i have anxiety about wasting time just laying here. but i cannot find a good reason to actually get up. about an hour ago i started crying. i feel heavy and like there is lowgrade electricity in my skin. i am uncomfortable. i have no idea why i feel sad.but i do know that my boyfriend otherwise ignoring me all night after dinner did not help. sure he made the food though he also had to eat but then he never checked on me. he got mad that i asked him for what was probably the millionth time in the last 6 years not to touch my stomach when he came in to say goodnight just before he went to bed. i do not like my stomach touched and i have been explicitly clear about this to him relentlessly he just does not care about my boundaries. because i called him out via asking him once again not to do the thing he was doing he curtly said goodnight and left without giving me a kiss as he usually would have done. that was my punishment i guess. he very often withholds various forms of affection and this is usual behavior for him. so i am not surprised. and i was not surprised he never checked on me because he is also very selfish and selfcentered likely a narcissist. but i am not here to talk about him and his many problems or how these impact me. while his behavior and the way he treats me has done absolutely nothing to improve my overall mental health i was depressed long before him and I am sure i will be long after. i was not expecting him to help today or do anything really but brought it up because i wanted to mention still that i am nevertheless feeling disappointed that the person i care about did not give me the care that i have in the past and would have given him if our positions were reversed today. i knew he would not but it still sucks that he did not. either way i was already sad and do not know why. this just did not help the situation.background depression has been a problem for most of life over the last 20 years on and off. in min my mid30s now. its better and then its not. i can go long stretches of almost months and be completely fine feeling cured.and then something will set me off again into a downward spiral. usually quite slowly so i do not see it coming. but I am getting better at identifying when the symptoms are starting to onset and i can start to employ my various countermeasures. but sometimes often really it is tough to identify what triggers it to come back. when my depression is bad i am insatiably hungry tired unfocused unmotivated sad crying on and off experience loss of interest in friendshobbiesfun have loss of sex drive and i cannot sleep. this is sometimes accompanied by anxiety attacks and a onetime panic attack. anxiety is new to the party in the last 23 years. and its not nearly as much of an issue but its there at times. sometimes with the depression and sometimes on its own. fortunately i am able to force myself to work so that it has never really impacted my career. but i cannot do much else when in a depressive episode. which can last for days to months though its been awhile since its been more than a few weeks. i live with my boyfriend whom i love despite his narcissism he is not all bad i swear. he just has a lot of his own problems and has no problem putting himself first andor being selfish. hes almost 40 and we have lived together almost 6 years and it is manageable for now as i cannot afford any other option anyway. he might not be helping my depression but he is not purposely making it worse. and that is a lot better than the last several guys. my US employersupplied health insurance does not cover therapy and i cannot afford therapy outofpocket i have researched this extensively. lethargic lowgrade anxiety sad for no reason.,Depression
38765,38762,i have a constant fear of potential health problem and not being loved and ruining my relationship when i m with him i m constantly thinking of thing that can go wrong and way i could screw up and illness that we could suddenly have i am exhausted of living but he make me energetic about life i hope i don t screw thing up with him he s great and my happy place i m anxious and i overthink just about everything coming out his mouth even when it is kind trying to take it day by day just wanted to rant,Depression
7661,7681,Idk what subreddit to put this in so I decided to put it in hereWhy is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive or too inconsiderate too myopic too loud too shy etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny or too fat or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. Work on your self esteem or You sound insecure. Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just insecure?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities,Depression

12424,12444,I am honestly not doing so fucking hot. I have not been doing so hot for the past 8 months. I really do not know what is going on with me. At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism and now that I am graduated I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore I am not sad anymore I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever my cGPA is a near 4.0 grad school is not too far. Career wise life is good. I am at my prime and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better and I end up disappointing myself. Like I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist peacemaker tutor caretaker for my family members and all that. And now I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training. I need to be there for myself for a bit but a night of simple selfcare makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely but I want to be left alone more than anything. I am so fucking sick of shit but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip but all I want to do is cry. Fuck I need a hug. vent,Depression
25516,25536,Just heads up this is going to be a bit of a long post but any help is appreciated.Hi so last Monday I acted stupid and started reading some dark depressing reddit posts about what happens after death the post was in an Atheist pov and that there is nothing after death. I am normally a very happy guy and I have never really been depressed or sad about anything but after reading this post I just got super anxious and very nervous about the end. Problem is before even if I read some depressing shit I was able to snap out of it but it is been more than a week and I cannot seem to get myself back together. I keep thinking about this. My mind seems to not be able to enjoy life anymore. I am always thinking what is the point of all this then if we just go back to nothingness. I am a recent accounting graduate with a full time offer lined up this year but I am not even excited for that anymore. I went to the fourth of july fireworks this past Sunday and while everyone was wowing amp whoaing I was just blankly sitting there deathly afraid of one day ultimately LOSING the beauty of Earth. My family was watching the fireworks next to me and I just got really sad knowing one day I will lose them all and they will lose me. I have a beautiful and wonderful girlfriend who we LAUGH together all the time. I went to IKEA with her this past Monday and while I am usually very happy around her I just kept getting sucked back into the anxious mindset of one day LOSING her too. What the fuck am I experiencing and how do I snap myself out of it. When I start thinking about that post I can physically feel my brain numbing and hurting a little like as if my brain cannot comprehend that I am ultimately not special and that I will turn to dust into nothing into the void. I have always known that we will all die one day but I have never WORRIED about it because we are all just temporary tenants of this Earth. I am just always sad now thinking all the beauty of life family girlfriend will eventually and certainly END. PLEASE any help is appreciated. I just want to enjoy life I do not want to keep having to think about this stupid thought. I should have never read the reddit post. My motivation aspirations are all sort of gone.... Please help am I experiencing Depression?,Depression
47117,47105,I am so ugly that it is ruining my life. Please help me. I am so exhausted. For as long as I can remember probably from about 5 years old I have been hideous. I was an extremely shy kid and had selective mutism so I was always self conscious. I just cant remember not being this way. When I started elementary school kids would constantly comment on my looks. They compared me to skeletons zombies and dead bodies. The few friends I had were told Dont be friends with her shes too ugly for you you can do so much better. I wasnt allowed to sit with anyone in the cafeteria in middle school and I had to stay in the library away from everyone. People left notes in my locker calling me all sorts of names. In high school people just ignored me and I was so lonely. Then at home my parents would occasionally get angry and call me a lazy pig.I know people have had it worse so the worry of me being too dramatic makes it even more unbearable.Im going to graduate college soon. Ive never been in a romantic relationship any men have just taken advantage of me. However I am extremely lucky to have a few supportive friends who have tried to help me. Since less people actively hurt me nowadays I expected this to get better. But if anything its getting worse. My nose is crooked my lips are uneven one of my eyes is smaller than the other. I have crooked teeth despite constantly wearing my retainer. My skin is horrible and I have this weird skin discolouration resembling a mustache that I have never been able to get rid of. I dont know what to do anymore. I have been to therapy I have tried body neutrality meditation anything you can think of. Nothing helps. I spend my days obsessing over my looks and my nights crying myself to sleep. I alternate between staring at myself for hours trying to figure out what I did to deserve to be this ugly to having to shower in the dark and avoiding mirrors because I cant stand to look at myself. It is utterly exhausting to hate myself this much. I know deep down looks arent everything. But being pretty would be so much easier. I dont understand why I was dealt these cards why I have these disgusting genes. I know other people suffer from this but they all have redeeming qualities. I am a monster. And I need to be beautiful. I cant stand anything else anymore.Im sure this post is all over the place and I apologize its just another one of those nights that I cant even think straight because Im so preoccupied with hating myself. Ive come on Reddit as a last hope because I dont know how to move on from this. If anyone has any advice or suggestions about what to do please let me know. Im begging for any relief.,Depression
16576,16596,Well...it took me awhile to figure out the details but my dream has come true at last. I hired a sniper to simply take me out. I do not have the guts to end my own life. No matter how much I think about it I just cannot bring myself to commit suicide. So...any day now when I least expect it death will arrive hopefully by way of an exploded skull with a high caliber round. Hopefully he will end my life as I am taking out the trash so when the garbage men come by they will see me for what I truly am worthless trash. Hired a sniper....,Depression
7241,7261,Its been around a month since I have had a depressive episode and its back again. The crying every night the thinking about my past causing me to lack sleep getting you look tired looks from family and friends who see me people checking in on me because they know something is wrong even though I try so hard to minimize it and keep it under wraps. I just have no clue what to do anymore. My parents would be depressed if I were gone and my alcoholic sister would never even be able to fully understand it who knows if she would even find out. After a while though everyone would heal and life would continue on. Maybe one or two people would visit my grave but after then the trips would become farther and farther away until I am just another headstone. Who knows would I even get a grave? that is expensive and I would not want my parents to have to pay for that. is not that crazy? We die and then we have to pay for dying. Fucked up. And even if I stay alive. Will anyone ever love me? When I was little I dreamed of being a single mom because I thought that it was more realistic than marriage. My cousin and I used to talk about getting beaten and how bad it was but we never told anyone because we thought it was normal. Now were both 20 and depressed. that is life I guess. Its coming back again,Depression
10979,10999,I am not happy in life right now and I want to do things but I cannot so I can go through 5 minutes of pain for a entirtie of of either nothing so thatsbbette than pain or a entirtie of doing what I want. If I was happy I would continue living but I cannot see anything picking up and I see nothing in anything I do. And my parents hate me I have got no friends I play for the second best football team in my country but I just do it because I am good at it and not because I enjoy it.Society does not care about men we are just like a disposable bottle society pretend to care but these fake depression people take over and the people who need help do not get it.Death does not phase me it is like being stupid it is only painful for others.I am so dead inside I could literally watch people get killed Infront of me and I would not cry. that is not a flex just got to get it off my chest. My philosophy,Depression
11386,11406,Basically I am stuck with a deformity I got as an infant which has ruined my face and life. It is called plagiocephaly and it was preventable but nothing was done. I always looked up to my dad because he was a very good looking man. I grew up always knowing something was wrong with my face because kids would always study it and I would get mixed reactions from girls when I was young. I have striking traits like deepset big eyes and a really good smile but it is all lopsided and looks weird from different angles. I have even been picked on before and told my face looked 'pinched' from one side. I had surgery to fix my mouth area and I am just all around confusing looking now since the only symmetric thing about me is my mouth. Yes even my skull is visibly asymmetric and lopsided. I can look in the mirror sometimes and catch glimpses of how I should have looked and imagine my face normally and it depresses me. Being ugly has ruined my life,Depression
47864,47847,I may be autistic and I'm only seeing it now Hey been a while since I posted something here. I'm 18 years old and from Brazil been having some great moments on my life overall with some amazing moments and alot of development from therapy but even with minor problems the real one is that I'm probably an undiagnosed autistic guy and even if it's a low to moderate level it makes me go nuts. This really seems like a he of a problem daily and yet I somehow manage to survive without ripping my ears off hate how anoying this is to the point I hate using the microwave and always add an extra second just to not hear it beeping how any sound looks like a jumpscare from a horror movie most of the time and on top of all this always happened to me on my childhood and yet no one even bothered to listen my side calling me either a crybaby that I was faking it. Got called alot for having no social life and yet no one seemed to care when I asked help or either seemed like they were forced to do it. Dunno if its autism since some people say anyone can have alot of symptons that are inside the spectre yet aren't considered but the good thing is that I atleast got a way to sleep better without having any noise waking me up with the new medication. Sorry if it was long this seemed the place where I could talk about anything envolving my personal hell,Depression
23868,23888,27 M here. I am just feeling bored of everything and its scaring the hell out of me. I am a big gamer and usually games keep me satisfied and my mind off depression. Recently i will turn a game on and turn it off in 5 mins. It no longer gives me satisfaction everything feels pointless and I have tried other activities like reading and listening to music. All of it is just boring to me i do not have many friends all i do is work and come home. I do not know what i should do anymore? All i want to do is lie down in bed and stare at the ceiling. I am taking 20mg of Citalopram and that could possibly be making me bored as bat shit does anyone have any experience with antidepressants and boredom? Would love to talk to a few people here and make some friends. Very depressed and everything feels boring?,Depression
24296,24316,I was healthy and did not need any surgery especially to remove healthy skin and tissue that is suppose to be there. I feel violated and harmed by what was done to me. Being born male seems to come with the idea that we cannot clean ourselves enough tgat we have to be surgically altered in a way that would not be allowed to be done to girls.The argument that smegma collects in the foreskin is still true for girls in the clitoral hood their foreskin and labia. Women also produce smegma. The idea it may be beneficial should in no way justify surgery on a healthy child. There are so many other surgeries that could be beneficial but are not done because it would be considered unethical. An example would be to remove breast tissue from girls as that would get rid of the possibility of breast cancer think of how many lives would be saved. it is the same logic. I have never experienced sex the way I was suppose to by nature. My bodily integrity was stolen from me. Society had more say over my body and has stolen full ownership over it. I had absolutely no immediate medical necessity for any surgery. I was healthy and was still subjected to a non therapeutic surgery. My rights were violated! My rights were violated but society justifes it,Depression
17074,17094,I was dumb and thought that I did not need therapy I was still taking all my meds like I am supposed to I just stopped talk therapy. But it has gotten soo fucking bad. I have been taken out of work for a month by my MD because of my anxiety and chronic depression. I have been trying to make an appointment with my therapist but every day they have been booked or going out of town for a week. I just need something someone. So if you have any recommendations for no commitment virtual therapy until I can get an appointment with her that would be really nice. I looked into better help but I have heard sketch things. If you have taken the time to read all this thank you. Would greatly appreciate any suggestions at all No therapist,Depression

48105,48087,Was feeling very low and went for one hour tantra massage. Was feeling very low not feeling like working and sleeping most of the time feeling worth less and very lonely... wasn't able to deal with it.Then i went for a Tantra massage for an hour I felt touched someone is making effort to make me happy... Touch of a skin on my body was triggering happy hormones... Finally i was on receiving end getting nacked in front of someone is kinda of excepting who and what you're no body shaming.It's not an optimal or ethical solution but for time being... I am feeling happy and high sprit.I want to know check with my fallow group members... Have you been to this situation any time and what you did ?Is that a right or wrong move?I haven't done it in past . Note No kind of sex was involved in it or any orgasms ejaculation.,Depression
23129,23149,Really I do not care anymore I would throw myself from the balcony right now I do not care I am tired. But I love my mother and she raised me when the rest of my family was absent we only had ourselves during my childhood and early teenage years. I cannot do that to her we talk everyday and she is so glad when I laugh she wants to believe I am not a lost because so bad but I am. I cannot hate myself more than I do I am a worthless piece of shit and I hate existing with all my sick mind and body I am 27 I lived long enough I want to stop this right now. The only reason is my mom,Depression
19570,19590,I no longer have hobbies. The only thing I do is baking but that is only when a birthday is coming up. I just focus on studying stressing about getting that good grade and degree. Stressing about finding a job. Stressing about trying to move out because I feel like my family does not appreciate space and privacy. Most of my friends are too busy with work school and relationships which is fine and all but it still sucks. I am crying more often. I hurt myself when I am angry and stressed. I have been trying to hold on to that childlike wonder but I do not think it will last. For the longest time I thought I could prove my dad wrong but he was right about all of this. Even though I have death anxiety I cannot help but also look forward to it. I can finally sleep in peace without any awareness. Transitioning into the adult world is making me realize that life is dull and draining.,Depression
18244,18264,What is the point?Does any of this matter?Would they miss me if I was gone?And more of the same old questions I have been asking myself since I was 11 years old. They said it was a phase... I am 40 now.The more I look for reasons to keep going the more reasons I find to leave it.Life does not seem too important. I do not value it like I once did.It seems like we are so disposable. Maybe it was Covid. Seeing all those people die every day and life kept going on. We all noticed the lost. Most of us felt it. But time did not care. It just kept on moving.Even as more people die from the new variants those of us who are vaccinated make summer vacation plans and try not to think about all the death and tears.I just do not understand it anymore. What is life? Why do we even cherish this world that keeps hurting us so much?Is it only hurting a few of us?Do other people really never think of things like this?Why cannot I just be a drone? Why do I have to have to want more out of life? Why cannot I just be happy that I am alive like everyone else seems to be?I am not expecting any answers to any of these questions. I just mostly want to know that I am not alone in these feelings.ThanksLukin Should I stay or Should I go?,Depression
17677,17697, I am not sure if it belongs in this subreddit. Sorry if notI recently become unemployed. I apply for 100s of jobs go to interviews and so on and so forth. Some went well other not so much. I also did a couple of mock interview and the most common criticism that I received was that I was not smiling enough. It kind of provoked some philosophical thoughts in me because smiling is expected not just during interviews but also in every customer service jobs. People who work in such industries have to look and behave happy even when they do not feel like it. They provide happiness on demand in a way and we customers pay to see it. It just made me so sad that the human society devolved into this. We make people smile when they do not feel like it laugh when they are tired and exhausted behave as if they enjoy their minimum wage jobs. And we expect them to do it EVERY SINGLE DAY while on the job. I cannot remember the last time I had a frank conversation with someone outside of close family members. I miss good old fashioned authenticity. Why so serious?,Depression
8252,8272,I have been talking to someone i had also met on here and i just told them i do not want to continue talking to them because it was beginning to affect me negatively. I feel like it was kind of selfish of me to do this because they have been going through a lot and i basically just left them. They seemed a little mad at me when i told them and now i do not know how to feel. When we would talk it felt like they were becoming dependent on me and it was just a lot of pressure but i truly did and still care about them. It just got too much. I do not know what to do. idk what i just did.,Depression
8475,8495,I have had to be constantly dosed up on it for the past couple of days.So far it is been the only thing that calms the HELLISH itching from the sunburn on my back. If you have never experienced Hell's Itch go step barefoot on a fire ant nest and just let them bite. Then imagine that happening for hours on end in a place you cannot reach.Unfortunately Benadryl also sends my depression through the roof and my filter out the window. Not good when I am in the middle of a longdistance fight with people I love very much. I said some really hurtful things.I hate being an asshole. I hate that Benadryl removes my ability not to be. And I have no one to cry to about it so here I am. I mean I apologized but like... What good does that do? I am still a horrible person. I fucking hate Benadryl.,Depression

21025,21045,I grew up in suburban Tennessee in a borderline fundamentalist Christian community. My childhood was extremely comfortable happy and sheltered. I love my parents they are genuinely caring funny enjoyable people. I never really acted out and I always did well in school. Never once did I fear for my future or worry about what was going to happen to me in adulthood. When I was a senior in high school I started to act out. I had a disrespectful rude boyfriend. Looking back I fully understand why my parents did not like him but he was my first boyfriend and teenage me was blinded by how much I loved him. While we were dating a tried weed and we had sx but like most normal teenagers I kept this from my parents. One day my dad happened upon a fairly explicit text from him and I was told to immediately stop dating him. I refused. This continued repeatedly throughout my senior year with threats to not send me off to college and constant yellingcrying matched between them and I about why god disapproves of me and why it was hurting them so much that I was sxually active. I eventually lied to them and told them I broke up with my boyfriend. The summer between senior year and college I saw him secretly all the time. I was constantly lying. It felt horrible but I was so dumb and in love I did it anyway. I regret this time in my life a lot. I went off to college somewhere far away majored in music and even then my dad was reading my texts. He read one about me going to smoke weed with some friends and immediately cut me off. I started to strongly believe I needed to be independent. I never asked for help from my parents. I got a job and worked almost everyday between classes my entire freshman year. I paid for everything but my tuition. Although I was proud of myself for this at the time It started a pattern that i could not reverse. It felt like I could not tell my parents anything for fear of losing them and losing the only real support system I had. I would not give them intimate details about my life anymore. I would not tell them when I was sad. I would not tell them when I would go to the doctor. I would not tell them when I got a diagnosis. I would not tell them if I was going to therapy. I only ever told them the positives. I would tell them if I would achieved something or just had a normal happy day. This worked for me for a long time. During college I worked enough that I never had to ask for anything. I had my moments of sadness or worry but I was happy knowing my life was stable. I broke up with my deadbeat boyfriend eventually which was for the best and suddenly my parents were proud of me again. The summer between my sophomore and junior years age 20 I stayed with my parents and interned at a music company. I had a rough summer because I started randomly hooking up with guys which was not my thing and I had to get my appendix removed which brought on several complications. My parents knew I was up to something all the time and started treating me coldly again. The withdrew their normal funny friendly selves and barely interacted with me. By this time I was tired of arguing with them so I just did not confront them about it. But even so they enforced an 11 o clock curfew on me and still occasionally bemoaned that I was not a Christian. This perpetuated the belief I already held which was that my parents' hospitality towards me was conditional. It relied on me conforming to their idea of me. When I went back to school in the fall the distance made things better. I started dating my current boyfriend who I obviously could sleep with and hang out with and do anything with without my parents knowing so they were in the dark and perfectly happy about our relationship. My junior was incredibly happy. I had a boyfriend I loved and my parents treated me like they were proud of me. Senior year came along and I began to consider my life after graduation. My boyfriend and I planned to move in together with a few of our friends as well. We were going to move to LA. This idea settled in the back of my mind during school and then became the focus when I graduated. I came back to my parents' house this summer I am 22 and I graduated in May and the plan is to leave for Los Angeles at the end of July. I have been applying for jobs constantly. Incessantly. I wanted so badly to get a job before I told my parents I was moving in with my boyfriend. I have worked day in and day out and I have not received a single email back. I understand this is how the music industry is but my fear of moving out there and having no help from my parents at all because they do not believe in living with someone before you are married is enormous. My dad once told me that if I moved in with a boyfriend I better be able to completely support myself because I could not expect any help from him. I am exhausted by the amount of work I have done at this point and completely emotionally drained by the fact that I have no acceptances or denials just radio silence. I have become so obsessive and stressed about it that my entire brain is consumed. I cannot be distracted. I cannot even sleep well. I am a gigantic disappointment to myself even though I know the industry I am trying to get into has very high barriers to entry. I have never in my life had no job no school and no purpose. My parents still treat me differently because I am not a Christian. I do not go to church with them because of a particular incident where I ran out crying because the sermon was about homosexuality and sex before marriage. My mom barely talks to me on these days. I have stopped exercising and eating healthily completely. I am on my phone an ungodly amount. I cry everyday and spend the other parts either applying to jobs or laying in bed looking at meaningless crap on instagram. I have an extremely low tolerance for stress now. I can become debilitatingly anxious at the drop of a pin. I do not think I am the same person to my friends or my boyfriend. I am not as funny or lighthearted I am really easily socially exhausted. I just want to be better. I want to be kind to people and be a great friend and a great girlfriend. I really desperately want a close relationship with my family but I am so scared of losing them if I am too honest. I cannot tell how much of my depression is situational and how much of it is something more chronic... and I cannot tell which option I should attempt to remedy first. Thanks for listening if you are reading this and I am sorry it was so long. Help me,Depression
9318,9338,So I am a 20yearold uni student and yeah I am not doing that good at uni but I am passing but the thing is like okay so I passed all my subjects with decent grades but like I just do not care you know? Even when I think about my future I just do not care as I have no ambition like at all? I just want to survive that is all. I do not really want to be the best or live up to my potential or whatever is that normal? Is it weird that I do not care about my future,Depression
27234,27254,Four years of treatment and nothing works. Meds are only good for a few months and that is if they are any good at all. I have no use for therapy. I am pretty sure that I am doing worse than I was before I would started treatment. So I am done. No meds. No therapy. I will just have to accept that this depression will not go away. At least I will not have to deal with side effects and condescending psychiatrists and therapists. I Quit,Depression
22119,22139,there is people out there that can actually be happy and achieve a fulfilling life. I feel sad every day. I feel like a nobody. I cannot enjoy anything. I do not have any healthy coping skills. I have no passion and no purpose in this life. I have felt this way since I was probably 12. I am 22 now. I am afraid to fail and I worked hard to try and make my family proud. I make good money for a kid my age. But I am not happy. I never will be. I succeeded fast in my job. But now its gotten so stressful and overwhelming that my life is spiraling out of control. I cannot quit because I would let everyone down. I would be a failure. But I already feel that way. I have no confidence. I am self conscious. And I feel anxious all the time. I am really not sure how much more I am going to let myself take this. I have nowhere to turn. I do not understand how people can do it,Depression

48267,48247,No motivation As the title says i have lost motivation to do anything in life.I can write thousands of word but i will try to keep it short.I used to have keen interest in music and astronomy.. i loved watching movies and tv shows too. But since last 45 months it's like nothing excites me anymore. I can't enjoy anything now.I feel bored with myself whenever i am talking with someone they get bored of me which is obvious because i never have anything to talk about. Everything feels so bland.And even when i think about how i can inculcate some new hobbies in me.. it doesn't really help me feel any better.It feels like.. there is nothing left in this world that can satisfy me or give me purpose atleast.,Depression
21194,21214,I have had anxiety and depression since I was a kid. My mom left me with my grandmother months after I was born and moved away. My father left the picture before I was born. I always felt so alone and always felt like it was my fault. Like I was not loved or wanted and just there. I am an adult now married to the man I love more than anything but have always acted as if everything is ok. Always acting strong when deep down I feel so tired and weak and hide it as much as I can. I have broken down in front of my husband once but when I did I felt so vulnerable it made me feel so much worse about myself. Feeling like he deserves better than me and constantly over think why is he with me. They say you need to love yourself first before you can lover others but how can you do that when you get pushed down no matter how hard you try to get back up. I was bullied a lot as a kid taken advantage of and has made me feel even more and more worthless. I tried to end it all by taking pills once but it did not work and thought maybe it meant I had a second chance at life and things would get better. As I became a teenager I continued to be bullied. Had no friends struggling in school since I felt like I did not fit in and made feel stupid even from teachers. Got to high school and it just got worse. I moved away to a new school new faces and depression grew more. I made some so called friends that never wanted to hear about how I felt. They were all so positive yet I was the negative one since I just never felt like I fit in anywhere. As an adult I have no friends at all. Everyone i know is married with kids and always asked when I will have kids. I do not feel like having kids is an options. I am scared of the thought of bringing a child to a world and have them go through the same thing I did. My job gives me so much anxiety on a daily basis. I work with all men who look at me like I do not belong there. Constantly being put down talked down to like I do not know anything or good enough for the job. I put a fake smile act positive but on my breaks I break down and trying to put myself back together to do it over and over again. Day after day and its come to the point where I just feel so numb from life that I sometimes struggle with how to keep on going. Everyone sees me as a bubbly person but that is all I can show since if I show my true self no one wants hear it. Sorry for rambling on I just feel so lost and do not know how to deal with it keeping it all inside just hurts that is much more and feel like ending it all would just let people I love down and doing that hurts just as much especially getting guided that I am an adult and need to act like it. I hate this so much! I am tired of acting strong,Depression

25794,25814,I have been thinking about it a lot lately. it is so simple. Walk up to a cop and just try to fight him and try to get him to shoot you. These thoughts see very intrusive for me but also suicidal thoughts in general. For example I went camping over the weekend and I just kept thinking about shoving my face into the fire. I do not know why. It probably would not even kill me and it would be very painful. But the thoughts do not go away. They never do. Suicide via cop,Depression
22427,22447,i cannot believe people actually perceive me and think about me. i cannot believe I am real? i do not know its just weird. i want to cease out of existence i feel like I am going to explode all of these feelings and emotions bottled up i just want to fucking explode but i cannot even fucking cry I am so mad at myself i hate myself hate myself so much perception,Depression
16436,16456,pent up emotions would always be creeping up in the back of my mind and could not stand myself anymore. Feeling of selfhatred is something that many people have experienced in their lives. I belittle my own selfworth because i do not believe that i deserve the life I had been given because I failed to meet the expectations of people around me and because of that I ran away because it was much easier than confronting my problems. Other times I see no value in myself for whatever reason and thus begin to think that i am a burden to society and the people I care about. Because of this i start to convince myself that maybe not existing would be better and I cannot get out of this unhealthy and selfdestructive mindset. I always look at the floor while walking cannot look people in the eye and I always have negative perceptions dictate so I think people will only say negative things about me. The most important thing is I never felt the meaning or value and joy of LIFE. Speech I had to do at school for an exam called Life its about my anxiety and depression,Depression
9190,9210,one of my latest ruminations is that nobody could ever hate me as much as i hate myself. what does this do for me? absolutely nothing. but it feels like an absolute truth. a perverse truth,Depression

14262,14282,...but only when you get it.it is becoming more and more frustrating with anything that I do there is always something negative people need to interject with. Never constructive. it is to the point where even small things are bothering me and that is becoming an issue. The biggest thing that gets me are these attitudes of X does it better so you are invalid or Y has it worse so you are invalid. It really makes you feel small and like a nobody.Time and time again I will try something again and it just ends up in the same place. Nobody genuinely cares which is why I rarely bother anymore to reach out and express things. I am in this alone and just need to deal with it I suppose. When there is nobody to advocate for you you just need to do it yourself. it is very hard to pick yourself up when you are in a tough spot.Am I letting the negative win? For now yes and I hate that. I really wish things could be different sometimes. Living a happier life will come in time I hope. Thanks for stopping by whoever you may be out there Positive Reinforcement Goes a Long Way,Depression

22088,22108,I need advice worried about my boyfriend I am not a doctor but I am a nurse. I have been dating my boyfriend for over 1.5 years and living with him for about a year. Generally speaking he is a very anxiousparanoid person. He also has days where he cannot get out of bed and feels down. He also has serious social anxiety and does not trust most people. I have wanted him to see a doctor about this for a long time but he was afraid of taking medications and did not want it to change who he is. That being said He was recently in a bad car accident. The people that T boned him died and he is really torn up about it. His friend that was in the car with him is also now money hungry and states that he is going to come after my boyfriend financially somehow even though the accident was 100 not his fault based on what happened and the police report. His car is totaled the police took it to a tow lot which has racked up to about 1000 there is attorneys involved and its just a big stressful mess. This has REALLY set off his anxiety and depression. Hes paranoid that investigators are watching him he feels hopeless hes super anxious he cannot get out of bed some days he has obsessive thoughts about WHY his friend would do what hes doing WHY the people pulled out and tboned him etc. I am worried the depression will progress and become even more serious. He finally talked to a doctor about it and the doctor prescribed Cymbalta. After doing some reading online I am scared for him to start it. It sounds like it has some harsh side effects harsh withdrawals if he comes off of it hard on the liver we like to cocktail and does not seem like a good starter med. I really want him to be on something but I am worried this is not the best med choice. We attempted to call the doctor to discuss suggested lexapro or Zoloft but the receptionist told us that the doctor does not like to be told what to prescribe. It was uncomfortable. Any professional advice would be great. My boyfriend a car accident Cymbalta,Depression
47769,47753,advice for helping my friend might delete later in case they see this I dont think theyre a Reddit user but just in case. I really need advice on how to help my friend. I thought it would be easy since Ive struggled with depression for about 3 years now but I just cant find the words to give any helpful advice. Im really worried about them and theyre addicted to a few things though they dont think that they have a problem so Im scared that whatever I say or do is going to make it worse especially since they often talk about wanting to commit suicide. All I want is to help them but they often stop talking about it once I start to sound worried. There isnt anyone else that I can ask for help at this point so Im hoping to maybe get some advice from here. Sorry if this is kind of vague I really dont want them to find out.,Depression
20970,20990,it is the hope that kills you. Time to go back to being depressed and pessimistic whilst the whole world celebrates and laughs at our misery coz of a few assholes. Dumbass bandwagonning from cunts on social media does not help. It would have been perfect too. Final at Wembley almost fully packed stadium cheering on the lads. 55 years of hurt. World Cup next year. Telling myself France losing the Euros in 2016 then winning the World Cup is a good sign. But i told myself playing at Wembley this year was a good sign. England not helping,Depression
8824,8844,Hi. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and I have been prescribed antidepressants since February.The meds helped with my anxiety and severe morning blues but it did not really resolve much of my problems.I was raised in a cult.I want out but cannot ATM.I want to restart my life.

26266,26286,When did you know? Like when did you think Hmm something is not normal? I just graduated from therapy when my therapist said that she thinks my anxiety was under control and it is. But I never talked to her about being depressed because I did not think I was. I do not know if I am depressed but I hate myself and I am so tired. I am not a good wife and after two miscarriages we decided to put off trying. I am a teacher and I love my job but I hate feeling like I am never good enough. I am just tired. When did you know you were depressed?,Depression

14954,14974,I love music. I like to dance to edm and rock music to help me deal with life. Its always about an hour or two of this rocks! Why was I ever sad?! and then all of a sudden it just hits me. I start to spiral and worry about everything that I should be doing but cannot. I give in turn off the music and lay back down. I hate it. I just want one thing besides sleep that brings me peace. Everywhere I go I have tried the hiking going for walks sitting in a park etc. but I hate that too. I live in a very small rural town. So going out is not really that fun not like a bigger city where you can just walk around all day and explore. Even when I do something fun after about an hour I want to stop because I am too hopeless to continue.,Depression
21232,21252,My family never talk to me about me my day what i have new.. they can talk hours about workcoworkers and i just sit there.I asked my mom to stop talking about work and her coworkers problem these problems just stick to me and i already have enough problems.Recently I have been looking for painless way to die i found some pill combination but we did not have it at home all i currently have is girl that is my close friend but i do not want to complain to her she is already doing too much without her realising itI feel like no one respects me at home when others sleep everyone who is awake tries to be silent when i sleep nobody gives a shit all are loud i used to be overweight and brothers gf made fun of my body i feel like I am air here so much is going on in my head and i cannot handle it people are draining my energy i have social anxiety but apparently who cares. I am just lying here in my bed crying and nobody knows i shared these feelings week ago nothing changed people still do not talk to me if i find some good way to suicide ill consider it. Only thing that kept me alive for past years is my dog cuddling with my dog. So many thoughts are running through my head every second and i cannot share them with anyone I have no one to talk to,Depression

It used to be only a few nights now it almost every night and day. I do not hang out with my friends any more and when I do I am forcing myself to have fun and laugh.

16962,16982,A few weeks ago I was planning on leaving my job and try to do something that I wanted to do in life just this once. I have put everyone else as priority and for once wanted to take some sort of control.The Universe said No.Started the month hospitalized. Today I learned that I have a semirare disease that will need constant life changes doctor follow ups for the rest of my life. cannot really leave job now since I need the insurance more than ever. Today I learned the news of a family member passing away.Today I learned the person I loved lied to me.All in one day I just lost and lost.I just wanted to do something that would make me happy.The Universe said No.I am so tired now.

16166,16186,I do not really know how to start this. Lately my self hatred has popped up again. The shadow that has always loomed in my corner was just waiting. I think it is funny really. It waited for a time to strike to absolutely demolish my months and months of therapy. I guess it just to decided to say fuck you. This feeling really takes its toll on me. This fake mask I wear is finally peeling off. The glue keeping everything together has finally started to disintegrate. My motivation to keep working has been decreasing dramatically. Spacing out and thinking about the cold void that is looming near me. I can see it. Just waiting.Why does the void look so comfortable. She has called to me so many times. Asked me to dance with her. Even though I tell her every time it is not my time. She stands there waiting with the Bouquet of Black Roses. I know one day. One day it will be a struggle to not accept that bouquet.Sorry everyone. Going through some shit at the moment. Self Hate,Depression

21352,21372,I have never ever been in the state that I am in now. The little things in life that used to help me get by no longer provide that same comfort for me. I feel like I have no job prospects in the world. I did not go to four year school due to monetary issues with my family. I feel so stuck working dead end jobs to the point where I quit out of anger and sadness. I feel I have nothing to show for the 26 years I have been on this planet. I am not suicidal but I legitimately do not know what there is for me here. I feel like Ill never ever find happiness and all I will ever be is a burden to those who love me. I do not want to spend my life having my soul sucked out of me by a job I spend the majority of my waking hours at living only for the little things. I fear I cannot take on the debt of going back to school now but I cannot imagine how I am going to be able to survive if I do not. I cannot picture good things for me in ten years.. I do not understand how people just put their heads down and work because it really feels like its all for nothing sometimes. It feels like even I had done all of the right things I still would not be able to do the things i know I want to do in my heart. I am just tired. I am finally getting beal help after putting it off for reasons legitimate and not for years. I hope improving myself will actually truly bring me some peace. This is jumbled poorly written and all over the place. I just needed to share this with people who are not family and friends. Sometimes it feels like there is not anywhere for me here,Depression

21447,21467,I 23M have been looking for a relationship for a long time but have had an awful bad luck so far tried everything but still failed everytime. do not know what is wrong is it me or circumstances. Seen people who treat their partners as shit still having a relationship. do not know why I cannot I know I am nog perfect but I am damn sure that I will show my perfect love for her. Have been told that I will be great boyfriend and what not by my female friends but still have had no luck at all. Also because of past failed relationships in which was left for no proper explanation at all have made me scared to start a conversation with others anymore. I do not know whether to put too much effort or not in the beginning or not. Tried both ways and still failed. Have developed trust issues and what not.Sorry just wanted to let it all out was just feeling depressed and thought of being end up alone. Just want a partner or someone,Depression
7091,7111,I am tired of putting up a fake smile fake laugh and shit. I think I am depressed like I have a lot of selfhatred suicidal thoughts almost everyday. it is so fucking hard to concentrate on studies. My phone is my only escape. I do not know what the fuck to do now. I do not know if I am depressed or am I just acting like and idiot. I do not know what the fuck I am going to do now.,Depression
11317,11337,I finally figured it out. Any expression of existential crisis nihilism neurosis or depress is what bothers people. They do not care that you feel that way they just care that you express it. it is as if any sort of negative emotion you are feeling causes them personal distress. They do not care if YOU are feeling it only that you do not share it. it is not the depression that bothers people. it is when you talk about it.,Depression
21277,21297,It can be really tough to open up about mental health struggles or something in our lives that may because or contribute to depression. I have the faith the risk to share is in fact worth it though.Something great that happened to me recently my friend helped me stay in a motel for a couple days to have space from a stressful circumstance. It helped me realize I am not stuck in an endless loop of the same old and there are things I can do which might be scary and uncertain but will also change my trajectoryI'd love to hear your encouraging stories too! What was something great that happened as a result of sharing your true experiences with someone?,Depression
7283,7303,Okay I do not know where to start and it is going to be pretty unorganised. And I cannot completely express myself so most of it is going to end up in my mind again ig I not sure.I am introvert antisocial athiest logical etc and this personality was not expected by my parents and people around me. they always have been forcing me to change my personality. I want to explain them so hard and with that rage you know so that they feel it ig that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday shouting and wasting your time just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that people here all neighbours judge a lot and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted and I have to pretend which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you I do not want to talk to you but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made how stupidly wrong they were it is not like I am correct but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic sexist illogical and it is also about me sometimes which are generally misleading and wrong even of my parents they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have which might have will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home even in school I am so shy I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind how hard is it? Damn it is hard for me and I am not sure why everytime I take a long breath to talk I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight. So most of the times I am like I cannot do anything now I do not care I will just move on but at night I realise how it is going to affect my life and I am like why did not I do that why did not I say that and get depressed everytime. I am sure that I am going to struggle my entire life and end up destroying opportunities and just imagine how my life would have been better. I am lonely never been in a relationship and have few online friends which is another source of depression and there are more things . Sorry if I have been just repeating topics also it was not as interesting and thank you if you read all of this . Idk why am I sharing this idc about upvotes It is just like when I am explaining about how wrong people were about the concepts to myself which does makes me somewhat happy ig but I end up in depression again bc that is not going to happen. It always ends up in my mind.,Depression
22670,22690,I know most people try to help me but my mother mainly makes me feel like a sick bitch she makes it very explicit that she talks to me practically just so I do not kill myself and she feels guilty she does not really care about what I say or do she just wants to draw her conclusions by forcing me to things and taking me away from the things that bring me genuine joy it is obvious she does not want to feel guilty if I kill myself but treating me like that like a burden basically only makes me feel worseshe also loves to say that in her time this did not exist and that it is my fault for feeling like this she also says that I do not want to get better and keeps pressing me to say everything I feel all the time calling me boring and stupid if I do not speak or I cannot get it all out in the way SHE wants my mom treat me like a crazy bitch,Depression

14445,14465,like any other post in this subreddit I am going to share my very short story. do not know if this is depression but i just want to let it out and organize my thoughts. I am 13 so my family kind of just ignores it calls it part of adolescence and hey i guess that is true. but it is been so painful i really need to let it out and i hope that it will go away as i grow old or learn to hide it i guess.a few weeks ago i stopped ignoring my scoliosis. i researched about it and hey it is incurable. i have to live with it until i die. haha. unless i get a surgery which is not really the best choice maybe even the last option due to the nature of the surgery being literally fusing your spine into one stiff bone. i was very shaken up which broke me. i started blaming myself. i feel bad for my mom. she had me when she was just 22. she was forced to marry my dad which is like 32 at that time. she was cheated on and my dad left us when i was 3. because of that until now my mom cannot have another husband. she cannot quit her job where she is treated as shit. now she have a daughter who has a disgusting spine. she is so strong. i feel so worthless and guilty of her suffering. maybe right now if she did not have me she would not have married my dad. maybe right now she married her exboyfriend he left her because she cannot marry him because she is still considered married. i feel like everything that is happened to her is my fault. then i started thinking what if i stopped existing or what if i killed myself. will she be happy? i was shocked. I am still 13. why am i thinking like this. i hate myself for thinking like this. i cannot even tell this to my family because they will think it is just normal or I am sick in the head. I have fantasised using a knife to stab myself or when I am in a car just getting in an accident. i do not want to think like this. my story is pretty mild compared to others so i feel guilty thinking like this. i feel like i have no right to feel like this because I am young and it is not worse compared to others.that is all haha. i did not want to dampen your mood or make you annoyed thinking why is she like this it is just hormones stop btching around. i just want to put this into words because i need to organize myself. i hope this goes away,Depression
25867,25887,I have been moderateseverely depressed on and off off meaning moderate for 8 years and I need someone to tell me if you can actually feel happy again. Like at what point did my brain not care about my external issues and was happy no matter the situation and all of a sudden I cannot be happy even if everything around me is fine. Even if I think a certain situation is the because of my depression I still feel the exact same way if I remove myself from the situation. For example I went on vacation for a good 2 months and was depressed the entire time. Nothing I do makes me happy. I am in the moment but in the back of my mind I always feel fucking sad. When does it end,Depression
19430,19450,My Psychological Health has been going rapidly down latly.The worst part is that I notice how my toughts get darker and more controversial like racism sexism etc.I was once in Therapy did not quite work I might be too stubborn and value therapist too little.Its summer time where I live everyone is on vacation or having fun in the Sun. While I isolate myself even harder and start to chain smoke just to pass the time even though the whole covid story is pretty much over.I am currently learing to drive it is not going too well. I feel so anxious even tho I have nothing to loose.I want nothing more then death however I believe that I will never actually do it. I will probebly get quite old with a lots of regrets and bad memories.Sometimes I am thinking about Evolution and Destiny. How do we humans evolve? I keep asking myself how our Genetics get filtered. No matter how much of a piece of shit you are somewhere out there is someone just as shitty as you waiting to start a family with you. To let the bad genetics live and multiply. For lives that are not worth anything. I believe that the only way we evolve is through death. Dying of the weak. Either you are stupidunlucky and die in an accident or have courage to kill yourself if you notice that your bloodline is unworthy. I feel or rather know that my bloodline is unworthy that it needs to pass away. But I lack the courage to kill myself and have enough luck and fear for my live to not die in an accident. But at the same time I fear growing old and the breeding instincts kicking in for me to have the sudden urge to have a family in my 30ths. I do not want kids. This life is not worth it. I should never put another soul through a life like this.But at the same time I should be happy. For FoodShelterWarmthHealthFinicial Stability a somewhat good goverment. All these things I take for granted. Still I am just always sadunmotivatedpessimistic.I do not deserve all these materialistic things. I do not value them at all.I do not really know why I wrote all of this. it is late and I need to vent. This post will not change anything. Nothing will. I do not know what to do.,Depression

10832,10852,Growing up my brother was insecure about being inferior to me and hated me. He made our parents believe that I was bullying him which is far from the truth I have always loved my bro but he could not help himself. I was constantly berated and no one listened to me when I had problems. I did poorly in school starting out and my mom often said that I would be out on the streets if I kept it up.I was a pretty weird kid entering school. I eventually figured out if I was funny people would tend to like me but that is really as deep as my connections ever went. I was molested by a school friend's older brother which is something I have never told another soul. It seems like I have a pattern of people making fun of me and trying to take advantage of me. I am not perfect but I try my best to be kind and accepting of people.That being said I do not have much trust in confiding in or forming new connections. Luckily I have always been pretty resilient. Though I have struggled with substance abuse in the past I am in a pretty good spot now concerning my career and physical health. I even managed to still have a few friends that I occasionally do things with but I still have trouble forming deeper connections.My family life has improved as everyone matured. But there is loneliness and I cannot get over the wall I have set up to really go about fixing that. I have been really focusing on myself for the past 5 years or so and while it has done me a lot of good I feel extremely alone with it all. I find it really hard to trust other people,Depression

9067,9087,I am angry and sad I want to scream and cry. I want to hurt myself or break something. I just cannot fucking handle this.I hate the fact that I am STILL waiting on therapy. Originally I was waiting to hear about scheduling. Then I learned that no counselors could handle my scheduleI work till 7pm monFri. So my supervisor said make it work no matter what. I opened my schedule but I think I am not going to hear anything back from them.I just need some way to cope with all these emotions. I want to be able to cope and I used to think I could but now that I am getting hit from every direction I realize all I can do to handle it is break down and hurt myself. I promised I would not do it again and now I just do not know what to do.I tried watching some YouTube I tried smoking my vape. I would considering trying to play some games but I will probably punch my laptop. If I go for a walk I will end up punching a wall and will make my work life harder since I need hands. I even considered writing some poetry but all that is coming to my head is FUUUCK I want to do something I will regret. cannot even jerk off because I am porn free now and if I use my imagination I would probably rip my dick off. So now I am sitting here numb but feeling all of this at once. I am just scrolling reddit not even reading the posts. I can barely feel my arms. I am considering going out and getting a 6pack but I am afraid if I use it to cope once I will use it to cope over and over again and I will end up a sad lonely drunk and then I will actually try to kill myself.I have got nothing right now I cannot even talk to my friends about this because there is secretsnot mine they cannot know. Even if I talked to someone they would probably not understand and try to twist things around or argue what actually happened. I do not need that I just need to feel better. My head is just so fucking noisy,Depression

11517,11537,The title is not meant to discourage others but it is what I feel things have come to in my personal experience with life. I just want to get some stuff of my chest even though it will not help for long. What better place to do it than Reddit? I do not know but I will still do it. I do not expect anyone to say the magic words that help so this is again more for me to unload. However there is a possibility someone can help so it does not hurt. I also rarely write large amounts of texts like this so I am sorry for the confusion you might get from the out of order randomness etc.. from this text.This is also going to be really long as I will include many things both as background and as reason.If you struggle with things yourself please do not take my text as a sign to be discouraged. I feel terrible when I see others struggle and I wish I could help them. let us start with a little about meMy first name is Adrian the rest will remain anon. I am just about to turn 24 years old live in Norway and have a stable full time job. I have an apartment a car and money is not an issue.When most people hear that they think I have life perfectly under control that I am more lucky than others. And to a degree that is true. I have been more lucky than many people in this world but it is not what I have in my possession that brings me happiness. What brings me down is my social anxiety combined with depression. I have a somewhat different type of social anxiety but I was still diagnosed with it. I can be in crowds be it in malls or shopping centers stores whatever it might be without an issue. Talking to strangers is not an issue unless it is random chatting. By that I mean if I am to pay for what I am buying and have do exchange a few words with the clerk in order to get something from the medical cabinet or something similar I have no issues at all. I think that is because I know what to say how to respond and all that it is all been done before enough times where I am comfortable doing it. When it comes to random chat however... it is tough to even do with my family. Primarily because I have nothing to talk about. When I am at work and my colleagues are having a chat I never join in because I have no clue how to participate. Even the colleague who is just 1 year older than me seems to have done a million more things and therefor have a lot more to talk about. While I sit there trying to think of something interesting I can mention but I am completely blank. When I do however get asked about something I do know it is quite alright until I make some sort of mistake like stating a fact that turned out to be false I feel like an idiot. I do not show that though I shrug it off and pretend I found it sort of funny. I live most of my life currently pretending I am happy like everything is fine. I work at a place I cannot show my depression to others. I imagine most places would be like that however. I am quite good at that now do not think most people know my life is... bad. let us go back in time a bitQuite early in my life after changing schools because of moving I was starting to become a target from bullies. The good old classic. Some people would constantly pick on me other people pretended to be disgusted when I was nearby some just ignored me and so on. The school's solution to this was to remove me from class... I thought back then that was great get me away from those people. I have however come to realize that it was probably a bad solution. I never got to work with other students never really had a chance to socialize the little bit you can during class. I was alone with a teacher of my own. I did have a few friends so that was something but long story short I messed that up and lost them.This went on until the end of 10th grade. Get bullied picked on and have a few nice people that I would stick with until something happened that made them go away. Then high school arrived and I was excited for a new chance with new people. and of course I liked the school. The first few months I attended school but gained no contacts. No one treated me bad so I did not really mind that.. Until one day where I entered my classroom 2 girls were standing by the door and laughed when I passed them. Thinking back at it now I think it was just a coincidence but back then it dropped my self esteem right back to the ground. 1 of those girls I even found attractive so that did not help. Then after a little more time things become quite good. I became friends with a few in class and the rest still treated me quite alright. The only thing that made me feel bad was the thought I still had not had a girlfriend. This was at the age of 16 quite early to sob about such a thing.. Year 2 of high school I went the route for car mechanics. I was back at the start of having no contacts friends or such. I was still treated alright by everyone though. I asked some people if I could join them when they drove to the store to get lunch some were over 18 and they said I would be able to join them it one of the car seats were not taken by a spare wheel. I felt neutral about that because at least they did not talk down on me or anything. Later that year I made friends again. Great right? Indeed it was school was fun again. Fun fact one of the people in this group was the girl I earlier stated I found attractive. The only relevant things from the rest of the year is about said girl. She was now a friend and I did not want to ruin that. So despise people saying she was interested in me I took no chances. So I treated her as a friend until near Christmas where I finally decided to somewhat casually ask her about going out and do something together. That was the day she just became the girlfriend of someone else in class. I was back at the bottom but pretended to be happy. Back then I was terrible at pretending and people kept asking why I was down. did not feel it was worth talking about so I walked away. She and the others though did remain my friends out that year. School year ended and people from that group started to become somewhat snappy passive aggressive. So I gave up on them too. I did however remain friends with said girls boyfriend. Next year I retake the same year but with another subject. Same procedure sit alone most of the time at first then I make 2 friends. We shared interest in gaming so we played online quite a bit. I believe these 2 were the best friends I had made. There is of course a girl in class I found attractive and she had a difficult personality to understand... I misunderstood her all the time and kept thinking she despised me. That of course did make me feel horrible a lot during that year. At this time I do believe my main because of depression was things like this. The year ends and I have to find a job but I fail. I think I got 1 singular interview during the summer. They did not want me there so I was without a job. Here is where I got lucky a company calls me and asks me to come in for an interview. I get there and see the attractive girl from last school year was also called in for an interview. At this point I do however realize I am not despised and we had neutral opinions of each other. At least that is what I believe. Both of us get the job as apprentices so there is that. During the next 2 years nothing interesting happens except me constantly feeling horrible about life and not having a single good experience on apps like Tinder and so on. Before I continue let us fill out a bit how dating apps have hurt me. By the time I had reached 18 my depression was quite strong. I did honestly feel like people hated me but were nice and hid it. While using the apps I was often unmatched within the first 5 seconds of matching. That did hurt when it had happened for the 20th time. I never dared to say hi to anyone so that is my fault I guess. Those who said hi to me first made me feel good! For about 5 minutes until you could clearly tell in the messages they were uninterested. Like the saying talking to a wall.These apps did bring me even further down overall. Never up. Back to the real life part. ampx200BAfter 2 years you take sort of an exam and after that you are no longer an apprentice. I scored maximum. 3 points excellent. So did the girl I was working with. One of the people I worked with suggested I invited the girl out for a celebratory dinner for finishing school 100 with a good score. It was worth a shot. She denied that immediately. This did once again destroy me inside but in the long run it was for the better. Both of us get's the opportunity to continue working for a partner company as long as the interview goes well. That it did. We both remained colleagues so that is when I realized it was indeed good she said no. About at this time though I make a incredibly stupid decision to reset my social life. I thought if I could get myself into a completely new social environment I would maybe have a better life in general. I did this because I was still constantly feeling horrible like people disliked me and such. After this I never made new friends and 3 soon 4 years later here I am still alone. I have never found another opportunity even to make new friends I no longer meet new people. The people I meet at work are a lot older no offence to them. And those my age still seem to look down on me. That is the big thing with me I feel like everyone looks down on me even without proof. The thing is with social anxiety is one notices so many details of how one reacts to your presence. Even to details that were never even there. I still am like this... Quite a bit of people have given me suggestions on how to deal with things I have even tried talking to a psychologist. Nothing worked. When people say good things to be it goes in one ear and out the other. When people say rude things it sticks like glue. I cannot take praises seriously anymore. I cannot take advices. I do not see the worth of anything. All in all I really wish I never existed. I have done nothing good to this world. I have been destroyed I no longer want help. I just want it to be over. The only things that make me feel good even just for a moment is random things like a stranger saying something nice. Compliments from people I know do nothing. I honestly think the only thing that would get me out of this she will is a semirandom situation that for example results in me making a new acquaintance. But we all know that is not how the world works especially for someone who is always at home when he is not at work. Summary I do not think I can be helped anymore. My mind instantly switches anything positive to the negative. I was recently back at a neutral state but then I had yet again a negative experience with another person which brought right back down to the floor. I feel worthless and all the other negative emotions one tend to feel during depression. This text became a complete mess I know. There is even a ton of stories I wanted to fit in but it will just clutter it all up at this point. The results of my depression was a couple years back I made a deal with myself.I will give life a chance to redeem itself. I have set a date in the future which I will not share but it is still several years until. If I still live alone with no friends with no sense of purpose with no light in the tunnel I am in... I will take my leave. It did in a way help to unload this but not as much as I had hoped because it did at the same time bring back couple bad memories of life.. I do not really plan on paying attention to the comments here but knowing myself I will probably still do it. I would also like to finally point out that as mentioned partially in rule 5. most replies with long explanations that in short just tells you that just to this and it all works out will not work. I am a very complicated work of machinery not literally. For those who are just reading thanks for your time and if you are struggling with something I do truly hope you figure it out.. I know how it is... I just cannot figure out my issues. Not everyone can be helped,Depression
10308,10328,you all ever...feel the opposite of what you are actually feeling?I have always been a bit of a weirdo when it comes to expressing happy emotions. I do weird physical ticks I am no longer sure are normal. Things like squealing or flapping my hands like I am a fucking seal or something idk. Maybe that is why I was misdiagnosed with autism XD or was I? I might never know but that is besides the point.Now days whenever I get intensely excited or happy I notice it makes me want to cry. Like I get brief flashes over stupid things like the book I am reading or a game. I get happy but its like I do not know what to do with it so I have the opposite reaction instead like wanting to cry or literally forcing myself into a worse mood. Or brief flashes of excitement that set off like a bomb in my head but sputter out within seconds. I know that sounds strange. Idk if its because I just do not know how to be happy or if I am afraid of it or what. I just do not let myself be excited or happy anymore. Maybe I am afraid that I am not enjoying the things I am excited about properly so I just do not? Like that makes any fucking sense? Idk. Any of you have experiences with this? Expression?,Depression
21291,21311,Normally I can keep my time and my mind occupied so I do not think about it but sometimes I observe something that triggers feelings of sadness and hopelessness. It usually involves seeing other people move up in life. I on the other hand have not found any success. To success in career finances skills and hobbies nothing. Its just wake up go to my soul crushing job go to sleep repeat. Its not as if I have not tried to pursue success in different areas of life. I have and continue to do so but I have only failed. Those of who are a bit older know what I mean when I say at some point you have to come to terms with your own limitations. Not everyone will succeed in this life. Not everyone has the talent intelligence and right circumstances. If there are winners in this world the ones you see and hear about then there are a lot more losers. Feeling down about my lack of success,Depression
10916,10936,I am such a shit person. I mean it. I am annoying I am awkward to be around I am just bad. I hate myself. I really do. I am not sober so I am understand I may be repeating myself but...god I suck. I just want to vanish. I have a husband and child so I cannot act on my self hatred but I often wonder what I would do if I had no one. I still do not think I would but I cannot be sure. I just want to get some disease that kills me quick cuz then my death will be of natural causes and I will not bother anyone anymore. I hate myself,Depression
7112,7132,I have had a really rough time recently my university experience ended I am and struggling with my time away from the friends I love from Uni.

I do not have much experience with self help I just want to feel better and be me again. What can i do to help myself? How do I m21 start feeling like myself again,Depression
14368,14388,my girlfriend has always had some form of anxiety and depressive episodes. she hates the way she looks and refuses to leave the house due to public other people just give her panic attacks etc so I am also unable to see her. she also refuses to tell anyone as she sees herself as a burden a waste of time and thinks it is embarrassing. I love her n want the best for her so I know she needs help but it is hard to get it her when she somewhat refuses. I do not know what she suffers from its clearly a form of anxiety I assume but what else does this sound like and any solutions to any of these problems are welcomed my girl is not okay,Depression
8761,8781,Any form of intimacy gives me severe nausea. To describe it in detail you know that feeling you get when you are about to throw up? Your saliva is basically the consistency of water and you feel something being thrown up your esophagus? that happens but i never throw up. i get on the verge of vomiting but it never comes. this would in turn lead to a racing thoughts shortness of breath and every other symptom of anxiety you can think of. This happened to some degree almost every single time. did not matter what the form of intimacy was talking cuddling kissing or having sex but the more sexual the situation the worse the anxiety nausea was.I have only ever had one partner and we were together for about 4 months but i had to break up with her because the anxiety got so severe that my feelings were lost for her because i was overwhelmed with how intense the nausea and anxiety was. it got to the point where even just hanging out with her and have nothing go on between us made me sick to my stomach and sometimes she could not even touch me or i could not even look at her. she was not abusive or manipulative by any means in fact she was the most supportive person i could have asked for. when things were getting steamy she would ask if i was okay and if i needed a minute when the nausea happened i would step out of the roomcar and walk around taking deep breaths and she completely understood. she showered me with acceptance and understanding and i still could not get over the nausea and anxiety. We were completely open and transparent with eachother and it still happened. The level of nausea varied each time though. sometimes it was a little other times it was so intense i could not move. only a few times did i not have nausea at all. Now after breaking up with her a few months ago i have had multiple opportunities to even just hang out with a woman platonically 1 on 1 and i completely avoid it because it freaks me the fuck out. i do not want to have any form of intimacy anymore because i know how anxious and nauseous i will get. It just sucks because I am comfortable with like sending nudes and stuff and that is about it. i feel like such an asshole for even doing that because i know i will not be able to go any further than that. I get this problem with other things too like eating and going on vacation as well as being deathly scared of smoking and drinking but this particular situation is where it gets the most intense and the most frequent. I am on Prozac for my anxiety if that is any additional information that may help. this whole thing has spiraled me into a deep pit of self consciousness and even self hatred. I have had countless nights just lying awake thinking about what is wrong with me and why i cannot justenjoy life the way i want without having to be controlled by the way my stomach decides to act one day. I do not need a solution as soon as possible i just need a place to start in order to fix me. 20M I suffer from anxiety related nausea due to mainly intimacy with another person and it has left my mental health in absolute shambles.,Depression
11905,11925,if i die then ill suffer in hell probably and if i live I am going to do something with my life i would like to kill myself as a leap of faith,Depression
19935,19955,Hate. Hate is too kind a word for the detestability I selfinflict upon myself. I am a traitor in my own mind. Wanting to betray my heart and usurp the throne. I have purloined my soul and left it an empty vessel. I take heed not of my salvation for I do not fear death I fear life more than and mercenary. It is a cruel and unjust bishop that shall condemn me to a purgatory of an unpayable debt I shall never reimburse. I shall not yield I shall be my own executioner. However I will fight kick and scream. I will writhe like a woman in labour. Until this fateful day shall I meet this hooded apparition? Will he embrace me as kin or shall I be burned in a pit of unending torment? I am the last soldier on the precipice of hope. I shall defend the unending hoard. I shall clad myself with the armour of a steely stubborn will Greaves to protect my falling ambition into a chasm of inhibition and I shall wear a pair of formfitted yet Gaped Gauntlets to wield my blade of desperation. I will fight until my inevitable damnation. I am endowed with eternal hate this I know...is my fate. A pessimist is just a disappointed optimist vent poem,Depression
21926,21946,I have struggled with depression for a long time. it is on and off like I am sure most of you are like. Anyways I just started a new job and feel great. My last job was extremely stressfull and toxic. I knew it was bad but I did not realize how bad until I left. Finished first week and feel soo much better. I know it is hard. But if you have a negative job or relationship or what ever try to change it. I try to be positive and that job was killing me. I was just comfortable there. It can and will get better. Comfort is sometimes a bad thing. Love you all Hey you all I have some motivation and positivity for you.,Depression

47596,47580,I'm writing this note then I'm out. Dear WorldI am writing this note with a heavy heart seeking and begging for your forgiveness for my pathetic and weak existence. I am sorry for the pain and disappointment I may have caused you all through my cowardly acts and weak display of character.My entire life has been a complete failure I have been consumed by fear selfdoubt and discouragement that it has rendered me powerless in almost all aspects of my life. I have tried so hard to fit in and be accepted but it seems like no matter how much I try my efforts are always not good enough.I am sorry for all the times I let you down for all the opportunities I squandered and wasted because I was too timid to seize the moment. I am sorry for all the people whose trust and love I lost because I could not face my shortcomings.I know that taking my own life is not the solution but I cannot bear the pain and the emptiness that I feel inside anymore. I cannot bear living in this world that expects too much from me when I clearly cannot deliver.I hope that one day you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for my cowardice and inadequacy. I hope that you can move past my shortcomings and failures and remember me for the good that I once was.To my family friends and loved ones I am sorry that I couldn't be the strong and dependable person that you deserved. I hope that my death brings you some form of closure and relief from the burden that I have become in your lives.I will leave this world with a prayer in my heart that one day the world will be a better place where acceptance kindness and love abound may nobody else ever feel the isolation and pain that I have felt during my life.I hope that when I am gone the world becomes brighter and filled with more hope and happiness. Goodbye world. Please forgive me.Yours sincerelyLiam,Depression

14039,14059,The point is in the title. I do not think anyone will want to hang out with me when I am this negative and depressed. But I do not have anyone currently and it is making me miserable. I do not know where to even start getting out of this mess. I wish I had any sort of support system but I feel like I have to develop a deep relationship with someone before I can tell them what is going on and most people usually end up leaving me almost immediately. I do not know how I am going to keep making it on my own without much hope of making friends. it is so hard right now I am depressed because I do not have friends but I feel like I have to not be depressed before people will like me,Depression
16897,16917,music is boring. video games are boring. rides are fun but not what they used to be. even pornography is boring at this point. take me back to a time where i was happy with less. nowadays I need so much just to feel any form of happiness. every thing is so darn stale,Depression

The she will of what used to be me is walking around interacting with everything from my old life but I do not even feel my soul in my body. Why do I feel so sad when I am the one who pushed everyone out of my life? I am the one who let myself be taken advantage of and assaulted because I am a stupid stupid girl who learned a lesson after it was too late. I am so tired of mourning the loss of the person I was and I miss her so much. I wish I did not have to deal with all of this alone and I wish I did not see that bad man's face in my mind all the time. I hate the new me,Depression

24826,24846,You know when you start realizing your old bad habits like not eating not sleeping or oversleeping emotionally numb so much anger and you know it is getting bad again but you have no idea how to stop yourself so you just let it happen . At the same time you do not let it show as it disappoints and upsets people so at the end of the day you really are alone. Getting worse,Depression
24659,24679,Hi everyone. I have been seeing a guy sort of on and off since last fall. He recently revealed to me that he struggles with depression. Until then I thought a lot of his behaviors cancelling plans to play video games for example were just him being a dick. Maybe though depression is having it is way with him? I want to try and be understanding and supportive without smothering him or making him uncomfortable. What things can a partner or so do for you when you are experiencing depression that are actually helpful? How to be supportive?,Depression
12723,12743,I am thirty years old female.I was born on another continent and now I live in the Bay Area. Due to my parental units job my nuclear family had to relocate countries and continents approximately every 23 years.While it may seem fun to explore and live in new places it completely tore apart any construct of social cohesion community and it obliterated the childhood and adolescent friendships I had formed. It certainly does not help that I am an introvert at heart.Just when I thought I was getting comfortable in one location or with one group of friends it was whisked away from me once again. I had to go through life milestones alone because I often did not have friends right after moving to a new place.As a result I became bitter aloof skeptical distant and frankly a bit lost in life because I did not feel like I belonged in my home country or the new communities I frequently moved to. I feel resentful and even angry.I am now 30 and I still feel bitter over this and quite frankly all I want to do is drift around and not settle down in one place. It has made me clinically depressed.I do not know what to do. Moving sucks.,Depression
22823,22843,I broke up with my ex but we remained best friends. She did not want me talking to other girls and I respected her wishes for 2 years. We hung out and did things as if we were a couple big mistake but she wanted it. Out of no where she recently dropped me and then she told me it was because she started talking to a guy. She was my best friend and the only person I had that really cared about me. I know it hurts her as well. She had every reason to leave me and move on because I understand how bad I hurt her. I am just now realizing that I loved her so much and now she is gone. I am not sure how to move on or how to stop being depressed. Its been 2 months and its gotten better but somedays like today I just get super down. I have no motivation for anything. I keep telling myself that I needed this in order to realize what I was doing was wrong but what if I cannot find someone like her? She was perfect Heartbroken and confused.,Depression
15176,15196,Called the National suicide hotline. My whole family found out. I need to talk to someone. The person that did not help me was named Clarence. How do I make sure he never speaks to anyone again? I need advice for clients rights services,Depression
8545,8565,I just do not know what to do anymore. I am 29 not done anything noteworthy with my life. Been dealing with depression literally all of it. And I just cannot gain any ground. I am doing all the right things. I have been reaching out for help since I was a teen begging my parents to let me see a doctor and get some medicine. I am in good shape. I exercise. I eat mostly well. I have friends. I am in decent overall health. I have got a stable life. I have got an objectively great job some family a few good friends finances are okay can afford to buy and do things I want. I have never done drugs not even so much as vaped or smoked a cigarette I do not drink But here I am every step along the way at my doctors and counselors doors begging for help. Trying all the medications I am on 4 now. And they help yeah but not enough. Got diagnosed with OCD which makes a lot of sense but does not help things. I have tried meditation CBT you name it. I am trying it. And I am not gaining any sort of ground. I can only wake up and bullshit pat myself on the back of doing the bare minimum of making it through another day so many times that it just feels pathetic. And exhausting. I am just so exhausted. I want to turn this movie off. I am not having a good time and I know the movie will not suddenly get better so what is the point?I am just so done. I am exhausted. What is even the point? I am making it through another day. So what? Now I am a little closer to actually dying in a way people will accept?I am just so spent.Exhausted.I just cannot keep doing this. At what point do we admit that some people just cannot be helped? Either they are too far gone or its just not in the cards for them?I do not want to admit that about myself but I cannot ignore brazen fact. I just do not think I am cut out for life. And the ONLY thing and I do mean ONLY thing keeping me from taking my life is the pain I would feel during it. Everything else I have already come to grips with. Making mom sad? Leaving my cats? Making a mess for the police to clean up? Etc. I have accepted all of that. I just literally cannot do this. I am trapped in this movie I cannot turn off and I am ready to burn the theater down. I just do not think I am one who can be helped. Is it possible to be beyond help?,Depression
25269,25289,Since I have had depression for year's my brain operates very slow and I feel it is made me very dumbed down? I used to pick things up fast and now I feel like someone needs to sit down and explain basic things to me and walk me through everything it is like I have no initiative or motivation to do anything myself? It really has made my brain work at a very low capacity I have to overthink simple things to make sure I am doing it right? Brain works really slow?,Depression
15885,15905,Has anybody ever found therapy cured their depression entirely? Did anyone ever go into complete remission after therapy? Do you know anyone who has? I do not feel like it ever leaves you entirely. Almost like it imprints on your soul. Even if I learn to cope better it always seems to be right there under the surface. Waiting for another moment to try and drown me. Genuine question,Depression
41166,41163,depression suck especially accompanied by insomnia and chronic pain chroniclife,Depression
22396,22416,I know I have something pent up inside of me but I just cannot feel it. Like a headache 30 minutes after you take an ibuprofen. I cannot even cry anymore. I used to be so emotional all the time. Now all of a sudden I cannot manage to force myself to cry. I did not like being emotional but I miss the liberation of a good cry. Last time I felt like this I attempted suicide. I think I am scared but I am not sure because I cannot fucking feel anything. Emotional numbness,Depression
24691,24711,I am so fucking depressed. I have nobody to talk to I am a traumatized mess I hate myself I have no fucking worth I only get validation through others. I am so fucking needy. Like how am I supposed to do anything like learn a hobby? Whenever I face something I do not understand or cannot do well on I just think why do not I just kill myself or give up on this anyway I have nobody that cares about me. I have a slight interest in maybe TRYING 23 things for fun. There are some subreddits related to all of these interests and even helpful people within them that want to help people. But imagine this as a scenario you are an artist trying to teach someone about something and at some point the studentperson does not understand something. There are multiple directions this can go. 1. Student does not ask for further clarification for fear of looking stupidbeing a burden etc.2. Student asks for further clarification but does not understand still feels guilty about burdening people3. Student has a mental breakdown and runs awayHow can you teach someone like that? I do not even remember what happiness feels like.,Depression
8613,8633,Hi everyoneI am at a point now where my mindbody are completely shut off when I am at work. I have been with this company for almost a year and it is no secret that I am incompetent and disengaged. I do not think this has anything to do with the company itself or the work or the people but the deteriorated state of my mental health due to years of major depression. Believe me I have tried many ways of coping but it never gets better I always resort to selfharm and suicidal behavior. I am so exhausted now that I cannot muster up any more strength to force my brain to focus on the tasks at hand. I want to quit so bad but I do not want to leave in an unprofessional manner. Does anyone struggle with their mental health at work as well? What did you decide to do about it? Selfharming at work,Depression
15736,15756,Everyday is a repeat of itself. I am going no where with my life. what is the point anymore? I have stupid habits I do things I do or things I do not like such as having to lock the door 10 times having the same routine everyday not liking certain textures like the feeling or sound of sand on my feet or silk or blinking habits. I cannot help it and I do not know why I do it however my mum always says to me do not be like that stop it you do not want to look weird. But I cannot fucking help it. I try to reach out for help but everything is so fucking tedious. No one fucking understands. I came out as trans ftm a few months ago and no matter how many times I say I feel uncomfortable with my mum saying things she will not listen. I fucking hate everything. what the point?,Depression

47308,47294,I wish I were a kid again Not having responsibilities getting excited over the little things in life making friends was way easier. I was obsessed with Pokmon and spent most of my days biking around the neighborhood with friends just doing kid stuff like trying to invent new parkour tricks. Having fun felt so effortless.The things I would do to go back even for a day. I genuinely don't think I'll ever be as happy again and that just crushes me,Depression

12119,12139,I hate making these posts so I really try jot too but it is just so awful the past couple days. I cannot for the life of me get calm enough to actual face the next week or so. A lot of co workers have taken time off at the same time and whith management being relatively bad they did not consider anyone else. So as a result I have significantly more hours then initially anticipated. And um scared to death of going on. I find no joy in anything anymore. It takes me hour upon hours of doing fuck all only to finally play a game or something thirty minutes before I must go to sleep. I am nervous and scared for my future because I feel like I have none. I cannot see myself alive in five years. I guess I am just scared and want a little reassurance without having to ruin my friends days by forcing myself into their day. Feelin like there is no hope,Depression

14662,14682,i stopped getting happiness from the things that usually make me happy. i do not know why it happened but it did. and it happened very fast. one day i felt like i was finally getting better and then the next i felt worse than i have in months.since then I have pretty much lost all motivation to do... well anything really. my selfcare went to shit. i have not been eating or drinking water much. I have barely been keeping in touch with my friends. i can barely even get out of bed.I have started to doubt that my friends actually care about me. i keep thinking they are only sticking around because they pity me or something like that I am not exactly sure. just general doubt i guess. that is likely due to my anxiety though.I have been trying to stop self harming for the better part of a year and i had actually been doing good for a while. now I am relapsing almost daily. I am not strong enough to stop anymore.i cannot be the real me. I am a demigirl amab and I am pretty sure my parents are transphobic and even if they are not they are extremely homophobic and they know I have dated a few girls so it would not be safe for me to come out.i do not know how to fix this. all of my usual coping methods are not working and i cannot find any motivation to try anything new. I am trying my best but its just so damn hard. just... fuck. tw self harm mention of transphobia and homophobia,Depression
14632,14652,I have not eaten in 28 hours at this point its common for me. I feel like a piece of shit. I cannot leave my life because I would end up without any money in a short matter of months.

I am not going to therapy I hate it and it makes me Feel like I have no option but to stay with the life I currently have.The only Other reasonable way out I can think of is suicide. What should I do What am I supposed to do,Depression
15422,15442,My brother has been staying in my room for the past 2 12 months. He was supposed to stay for a week home from college and I have been sleeping in the living room. He leaves trash and dishes everywhere my room smells terrible my bathroom has mold because he does not hang up the bath mat and there is piss on the toilet seat.After he yelled at me tonight for standing up for my mom I text him that be needs to have his stuff out by the day after tomorrow. After I tell my mom what I did she starts crying saying this is not how she wants her kids treating each other.This is after an entire childhood of him abusing and yelling at me every day. And honestly? I deserve to be an asshole to him at least once. The ONE time I stand up for myself and I get ridiculed for it,Depression

It should not hurt she is not wrong nothing gets a rise out of me. I have been miserable doing everything. Work home I am just blah about every everything. But hearing it affect her hurt a lot. I was watching Bojack and Diane started taking antidepressants. I asked her if she thought I was depressed. She said yes.

24506,24526,hey guys I am not sure if this is the right place to post this but a close friend shared with me that she has been having suicidal thoughts inflicting self harm a lot and has depression. She has disclosed that this has been going on since she was 13. she is been telling me a lot about her past and the trauma she has from it especially from relatives and family. She experiences suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I have suggested therapy but she has been to therapy a few times and during those times she said the therapist shamed and judged her for being like this and called her a slut and a druggie. She takes meds from a psychiatrist as well. Mentally I am distressed as I have no idea what to do and I definitely need advice. a friend I know has depression and suicidal thoughts what should I do?,Depression

12861,12881,I feel like I have to write this down to finally say something to myself outside of my damn thoughts. I am a 15 M and spent about 2 years putting on the happy face at school and pretending I was content to then spend the rest of my day home wishing I was not here wishing I did not exist sometimes pretending I did not and imagining the happier life everyone else would have and how much better off they would be without me. These thoughts cloud my mind all to much and make me just want to disappear I thought I had beat it and thought I was done then I fall back into the same depressive spiral of reasons I should not exist reasons why I am a fuck up. I heard this quote from my English teacher one time life is suffering suffering is what gives life meaning and he was right everything ends all the good we have eventually becomes bad and we always pay a price. I keep falling into this hole and digging it deeper and I am sick of it how do I fill the damn hole and pull myself out at the same time because I do not feel right and am sick of this I do not understand what it takes to be fixed or if its possible. I have not cried in months and whenever I feel like it I become consumed with self anger and its reaction its not me but it is becoming me and I do not know how to stop it or what to do. Me,Depression

When i use things that are dopaminergic my mood goes right up to happy land but i feel like i already have too much norepinepherine causing intense anxiety so I am hoping the clonidine would keep that in check Have any of you all used Lamictal with Wellbutrin? And possibly clonidine,Depression

I am trying to lose weight I am 1.90m and 88kg and i think I am hideous I am also sad all the time at feel numb at times. And when I am alone i get extremely sad.

And i have only 1 friend that i really like. I am not looking for help i just wanted to say this. I am depressed,Depression
24687,24707,I hate myself and who I am becoming the best thing is for me to die. I cannot anymore..,Depression
10327,10347,Venting. This is long sorry. Feel free to downvote. I am used to everyone hating me and I usually get downvoted all over reddit too whenever I make a post even when I go to an advice sub to actually ask for advice. I am just getting treated like shit wherever I go. it is fine. And no I do not jerk off all day and I do go out. Actually I do not jerk off at all. Yes people on here claimed that that was my problem without knowing me and without me saying anything of the like.''it is your mindset that is what keeps people from befriending falling in love with you''Yeah right. that is why abusive men who just know how to act normal in front of others get to have beautiful normal lovely women by their side who are unable to break up because the guy made her seriously love him. These kinds of people have the most fucking insecure mindset you could imagine but because they are just so good at dealing with people by nature without having to practice the tiniest fucking bit everyone wants to suck their cocks.''You just have not found the right people yet''I am fucking 24. TWENTYFOUR. THE OLDER YOU GET THE HARDER IT GETS. STOP DISMISSING EVERYTHING FOR FUCKS SAKE!!!! HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL I FIND ''THE RIGHT PEOPLE''?IF YOU ASSUME THAT EVERYONE MOST PEOPLE ARE SHIT YOU ARE TOLD IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR BEING ALONE BECAUSE YOU THINK OF OTHERS THAT WAY IF YOU do not PEOPLE TELL YOU ALL THE PEOPLE you have MET WERE JUST SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? FUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHITAnd EVERY FUCKING TIME I tell THIS to people both of the above they shut the fuck up because they realise that I am right but at the same time they will not admit it because they subconsciously seem to believe that admitting these things makes their lives pointless and they want to kill themselves. Worst case because they are out of arguments they just say ''you are wrong. you are just depressed. it is your depression talking.'' or they even get angry XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD''You are your own best friend''Have fun getting a good job from yourself. Have fun having sex with yourself. Have fun talking to yourself. Have fun living 90 years of your stupid live and dying all alone by yourself.''You are not being kind to yourself. Just because someone rejected your friendship does not mean that there is anything wrong with you.''Yeah be kind to yourself for being absolute dog shit at everything you do even when you do it for 8 hours a day for 12 years of your life. Be kind to yourself for breaking your wardrobe out of anger. A couple of doors. A window. Be kind to yourself for being snappy with the few friends you had and treating them badly NO I do not DO IT ANYMORE PEOPLE STILL FUCKING HATE ME YES THAT MEANS I HAVE IMPROVED BUT IT does not MEAN ANYTHING TO OTHER PEOPLE APPARENTLY and let us NOT act like it is a giant achievement anyway. Be kind to yourself for being so incredibly socially awkward with people that they automatically assume you are a rapist serial killer werewolf. Be kind to yourself and every one of your problems will magically go away. it is just like just believing in yourself that you are going to pass the exam tomorrow without having studied for it at all or having studied for 5 days straight without understanding a single thing because you are too stupid.it is all bullshit. What these people do not understand is that having a ''positive mindset'' ONLY WORKS IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR. I CANNOT BE HAPPY BY BEING IGNORANT OF WHAT I AM.''I am just trying to help''How incredibly selfless of you. Are you? Or are you just telling yourself that so you can think that you are much greater than you already think you are? This is a classic defensive reaction when people realise that what they just said is incredibly dismissive and mean.Some of these people even claim they have depression and at the same time call suicidal people selfish or ''more selfish'' my enw favourite.People are SO unable to see life through someone else's lens it is fucking disgusting. You talk and talk. You seriously believe just because your life is perfect and you get EVERYTHING you want means that everyone can do it and they are just NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH. FUCK YOU! Just because YOU are happy being alone does not mean that everyone can be. Just because you are happy with never being loved does not mean that everyone can feel the same. Just because you do not care that you are horrendously shit at conversation does not mean that everyone can accept it. Just because you are fine with being unfuckable does not mean everyone likes being it. Stop being so fucking arrogant and ignorant. Admitting these things does not mean that you are shit and that you should kill yourself. If you can deal with it GOOD FUCKING JOB! No seriously I am glad that you are fine with yourself. But also seriously GET OVER YOURSELF and stop FUCKING DISMISSING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS AND SUFFERING. it is SO INFURIATING.Yeah I would kill myself if I could BUT I cannot. I literally cannot get ANYTHING right in my life. I am too afraid to die. I just want to stop suffering. I am so sick and tired of not belonging anywhere. I am so sick and tired of being the universe's laughing stock. I am so sick and tired of being my parent's toy. I am so sick and tired of being shit at EVERYTHING I do no matter how hard I study or practice. it is completely fucking hopeless.I JUST do not IMPROVE.I talked to so many people I did not know at all and my ''SOCILAOIAILL SKILLZZZ''JUST NEVER GET FUCKING BETTER. I CANNOT IMPROVE. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING BY MYSELF. it is POINTLESS.I will just get drunk again. I finally know why my mother keeps doing it. Felt good the first time around and I might as well just do what my parents are doing. Second time I did not feel super happy like before but I also barely suffered because it numbs you nicely. it is not like anyone gives a shit. After all it is all just in my head right? Nothing is real. All of this must be a simulation... there is no other way... I cannot get the help I need and nobody truly gives a shit. My problems are just getting dismissed by everyone and I am led to believe that all the problems I am facing are hallucinations facilitated by my depression and it is driving me insane. Why is everyone trying to destroy me?,Depression
24067,24087,Using an old throwaway account. I am 33 located in the US and I have had anxiety issues for quite a long time. I should have started therapy when I was 18. Recently I have been trending much more towards depression and I NEED to address it now. My questions areHow do I find a therapist?What is the average cost? I created an account for my insurances website to see my plan and it does not look like they cover it at all.There are different types of therapy? How can I tell what type of therapist to use?I am sure I will think of more but I am having a hard time concentrating. Like I said anxiety issues up the wazoo. Had them for most of my life but I think it got much worse after a bad salvia trip around 10 years ago but that is not important. I have an extremely hard time discussing and articulating my emotions. The last few weeks I began having intrusive thoughts about suicide hello hotline bot I am safe now but I like that you are here anyway. I have most definitely also lost interest in the things in my life that brought me joy and the past week my appetite has gotten markedly lower. So yeah depression. A little over a week ago I had a yearly physical but I guess my answers to their mental health questionnaire did not raise any alarms and I was scared to ask how to go about starting therapy.On to my little rant at the start of April a coworker invited me out to get drinks and we hit it off amazingly. I am actually one of her supervisors so we had to keep it hush hush at work. Texted constantly for the first few weeks neither of us had felt that kind of connection to someone else before. Conversation that flowed from one topic to the next from getting out of work at 5 or 6 until going to bed around 1. We also saw each other outside of work at least every other day. That pace kept up for about a month maybe got a little slower through May.By June we were seeing each other less and while texting nearly every day we are talking much less and I feel my apprehension to discussing my feelings is the because. I care deeply about her and I do not want to lose her because I am unable to talk seriously about us. Add to that having to see her at work every day and I am a mess of emotions which have really boiled over the last couple days. It was my birthday on Saturday and I spent most of it crying in my room dreading having to respond to the birthday wishes I was receiving. This evening I asked her when I could see her next and did not get a reply. Four hours later I asked if we could talk and was again met with silence. I am not the type to incessantly send messages hoping to annoy or guilt someone into responding so I left it at that but in the words of Tom Petty the waiting is the hardest part. I do not know what exactly I am looking to accomplish with this post. I have a good amount of friends but I do not have a best friend that I can confide in and talk to about things like this. I am just a mess of a human right now and I think my brain is trying to go in so many directions that I cannot even have a good cry even though I think that is what I want in this moment. Questions about starting therapy and a little rant,Depression
10214,10234,Hello there! I am 18 and do not know what is going on with me. Sometimes I have a really bad mood and sometimes I am fine. This consists of a week or so of feeling bad about myself hating me and basically everything I do. I do not find joy in almost anything and I feel empty and stuck in a dark void. I feel like something is missing. Sometimes I just want to be lonely and sometimes I want to have friends around me. Music is also a big thing because it sort of detaches me from everything. At this age I need to find a path in my life and seeing everyone around me already having dreams and going for a future career makes me feel useless. I do not know what to do with my life. Some days I feel infuriated about everything and everyone. Some days I do not. Some days I am just waiting for the night to come just so another day can start. have not felt suicidal or anything like that.Every single time when that feeling comes I become really careless about everything. do not fold my clothes anymorefor example. Everything is a mess to be exact. I do not have the energy to do and deal with anything.I feel lonely even tho I have friends then everything comes back to normal. I can feel good again and can feel an inner peace again. Everything settles down for a moment and comes back to normal. have not spoke to anyone about this except a friend of mine. I am not doing this for attention or anything I just want to know what is happening. Thank you so much. What is happening to me?,Depression

18623,18643,I am falling into a depression hole again the waves keep getting worse and need some help finding new coping mechanisms I do not have any that work more than once in awhile for me currently and I do not have the motivation to be on my phone or leave the house it just keeps giving me things to be depressed about. I found out I was inexplicably shadow banned from a help subreddit to put icing on the cake for today. I do not have any friends relationships or close family to help either and my situation is cutting off alot of that ability anyway..My coping mechanisms have been taking some time for my hobbies and me but they have lost all their color and I am finding cleaning becoming more straining and I have been sleeping more and more. I have been very depressed lately and would like some help finding new coping mechanisms,Depression
13011,13031,Every day I just go about it zoned out I cannot focus on anything I cannot enjoy anything for more than a minute or twoLogically I know I have enough. Someone who loves me a fairly stable life but I do not feel anything. I throw on whatever face makes things go most smoothly and go ahead with another day of this fucking awful purgatory I do not remember the last time I had any sort of aspiration in life. Honestly I hope I just get hit by a bus or get spiced up by an unruly outlet so I do not have to keep doing this but I am not going to be too optimistic about it. Idk. I do not see things getting better I do not see myself trying to make things better. Not going to self delete because Id rather not suffer guess its purgatory forever. I feel empty. I have nothing I want nothing,Depression

48128,48110,I wish I could get hit in the head and forget my past I just dont really care anymore I guess. I just hope I get some brain injury so that it causes memory loss or something a long those lines. Dying doesnt sound so bad either honestly but forgetting would be way better. Then I could function again and be happy hopefully.,Depression

12943,12963,I have been struggling to enjoy anything for the last couple of months. I feel at my lowest lately I lost all my confidence and i just want the days to pass as quickly as possible. I just want to sleep all day or pause life for a year. All of this is happening with me because of a toxic relationship. We ended things like a month ago but it should have been more like a little break where we would work on ourselves. The problem is that we still hang out a lot but I am the only one fixing the problems trying to do better and changing things. She says that she has put enough effort in the relationship before and now it is only my turn to do that I was not the only one being toxicshe was too she thinks i was more toxic than her I am trying everyday to fix thingsbut she disrespects me a lot she plays me and puts me through a lot of shit that literally destroys my mental. I just cannot leave. I know it sounds easybut i cannot do it. it is impossible. I do not have the strenght to do itbecause i lost all my self esteem and i just feel stuck here hanging on to the tiniest string that i can save the relationship. I feel so deppresed and unhappy and i do not want to live life anymore. I am not suicidal. I just wish i could fast forward my life. I cannot enjoy anything anymore,Depression
23279,23299,I am severely suicidal and I wish to die soon. I have missed out on all the fun and social life and whatnot I should have had starting in elementary school. Nothing can make up for it. I have been to multiple doctors and therapists and even an outpatient program I have been on every kind of medication and multiple of each kind. Nothings has helped at all if anything really all this bullshit has made things worse. I had originally intended to live for a while longer and see if things get better but I cannot take this suffering anymore. Possibly as a last ditch effort I will go into full on hospitalization and see if that helps but if that does not help I will plan to euthanize myself. I have missed out on my childhood and years,Depression

18997,19017,I do not know if this is a depression thing or not but pretty much my heart can run up to 90bpm but I can still fall asleep with so much ease. Sometimes I cannot even stay awake even though my heart will be like that. Anyone else experience this? it is been this way for me for many years. I can drink a lot of caffeine and still fall asleep if I want to. it is easier to prompt myself to stay awake with caffeine consumption but if I want to sleep it is no problem. TLDR Anyone get a fast heartbeat yet still sleepy as hell? Racing heart but still sleepy as fuck,Depression
25640,25660,I do not do anything all day. I wake up and sit at my computer on the lock screen. I have hovered over video games but I cannot bring myself to press play. I do not talk to my friends anymore. I do not leave my room unless I have too. I only eat and workout because of the basic human need to. It gets to me sometimes I have never cut but I have gotten really close sometimes I will take a dull knife and run it across my wrist to feel the adrenaline. But yet I feel like I have nothing to complain about I feel like I do not have the right to feel like this. I have amazing parents and a roof over my head but I am still like this. I do not see the color in the world anymore everything is just black and white. I wish I could have stayed 12 when everything was amazing and I would go to school with a smile and my face would light up when I see my parents or my sister when I would play basketball for hours on end with my friend. I wish I could talk to 12 year old me ask him if his proud of me or if he resents me for ruining his life. The sparkle in my eyes faded ever since 7th grade and in the brief moments of laughter and happiness I get are only a few seconds of vibrant colors compared to the hours of monochrome. I do not see the color in the world anymore.,Depression
17893,17913,Iv been to therapy for so long that at this point my 5 year therapist just reminds me each session how much of a incomplete piece of shit Iam. Iv tried going to bars and clubs in hopes to learn how to socialize and got so many disgusting looks that it crushed my soul and caused a mental breakdown on my walk back home. So according to my therapist going to the bars and club is the final step. I was also told not to ask how do to get started improving myself because I should know where to start. So my brains just been a static mush there is so many questions with no answers. There are things that have to get started with no clear way to begin. All I could do I suffer in silence and beg the world to end my suffering soon. Every day I swear is like a new nightmare. I get to work with people who make alot of money and hear about their lives and what houses they are going to buy and make and trips they get to go to. Places I can never go since I do not make shit. it is like I am truly in hell always seeing people happy and enjoying life while I get rejected from it and get to see not touch. The people who hand out advice are the people who are already at the top. I have to scramble and work 1000 harder to experience 1 of what is given to them naturally. So I ask what is next? do not send the suicide hotline to me because I do not even have the guts the will or the mental state to end myself because I am a fucking coward. Not sure what is next warning ventingquestion,Depression
10285,10305,Started smoking a lot of weed but even that is kind of losing its charm now. I guess you do something for long enough it becomes normal. And my normal is just this. Idk I am really tired of people telling me this is cuz of the pandemic. Cuz I know I was this lonely even when I was surrounded by people. My therapist was right. I do not want to help myself. I do not want to be happy. So why am I here. Well shit,Depression
8642,8662,Who else knows the feeling of going into a new place but knowing that the new people you will meet you will disappoint when they get to know you? I started a new job and while I am still looking for work from home jobs this job is so hard to wake up to every morning. The work itself requires a lot of emotional labor and is the kind that does not finish. People were nice to me here at first but the way that I am I do not act the way I look I guess. I am way too shy do not take risks naive. Now its lucky if people look my way. I was never good with people and coming back to work with other people reminds me of that and its just frustrating all over again. I get headaches at the end of the day. And then I have to do it all over again the next day. I tried this job but Ill need to find something new. Its a cycle,Depression
20263,20283,I studied psychology in undergrad. Been trying for 2 and a half years to get into grad school. 4 rejections because I am dumb as fuck and have no utility in the real world. I have been working as a case manager for the past 2 years being an underpaid personal assistant for the chronically mental ill along with Uber driver. I have a case load of 28 I am expected each week to ensure the client is able to navigate his or her diagnosis.. Fuck I have lost hope In mental health all together next time you meet with your therapist recollect that all he or she does is reflect your thoughts and affirm your shitty decisions that lead you in to this place all together.. have you met any one in mental health field that is actually happy because its been 2 years and I have not met a soul who is not a fucking coward or in it for milking the insurance. Or who actually fucking cares about science. Where does that me. A person who lies in the diagnosis of being depressed but does not believe a word they say because its all subjective SJW BULLSHIT..What if I want to identify myself as a depressed man who drinks 8beers a day and smokes weed until my thoughts are so far gone that I would not even recall them when I am sober. What if that makes me fucking happy. You feel great satisfaction the feeling that beer gives you Yep I sure do. Idk this a rant from the most raw feeling that can express. I just want to make a difference and help people. But I cannot even help myself. What kind of adumb fuck wastes 4 years of his life to study a topic that pays so little and exposes you to daily traumas and countless victims of the universe.Fucking victims everywhere get over yourselves your going to fucking identify as depressed and anxiety ridden even though you did not have to storm the beaches of Normandy or die huddled in a gas chamber because of your religion or face persecution in any other way except for your ego to get bruised a bit because you are to fucking stupid to come up with a rational argument to yourself of why you are not fucking worthless. Act like your fucking with something because its not going to matter to anyone else but yourself. You suffer because you desire. You desire to feel something different than what you feel daily. Maybe the only thing to do is bear the suffering and bear the burden for other people. I am going to do the best I can believe that is the only thing I can do. This was no filter typing. I believe in you all just do me a favor and do not claim to be a Victim own your shit.Much love Fuck it,Depression
11470,11490,I do not know if I am going to continue life or not it is really scary not knowing when I will finally snap and end it all it could be in an hour or a week or 8 years or never I just do not know it is to the point where it is a waiting game it is a 'when' not an 'if' and I am scared that I will not be able to see my younger siblings grow and become adults I will not be able to become the therapist that I want to I just do not know when I will end up doing it. it is an incredibly scary thought that some day I will probably kill myself I just want help I want these thoughts these feelings to go away I just...... cannot anymore. I am scared,Depression
13894,13914,I had an awful blowout fight and I am just bawling my eyes out outside a laundromat. I lost my ability to even argue during I just kept saying you are hurting my feelings right now. And this makes me feel really bad. I feel absolutely useless as a person rn. I feel alone and scared. This really sucks. Why am I the person going through this right now? I hate this. I have been struggling with depression for years but I feel like I am at an all time low. What do you do when you are scared and afraid and alone and you are in a bad place? How do I feel better in the immediate future? I am currently weaning off an antidepressant and I have been in therapy for a long while. I just need help getting through this horrible moment or moments. I am having a really bad time right now crying outside a laundromat,Depression
12911,12931,I hate the person I have turned into. I am constantly in bad mood and whenever something triggers me i will throw stuffs and destroy things. I cut myself too much that my arm always have marks on it. Whenever I meet someone I will act like my life is good and I am a happy person but most of the time I am not. The thought of talking to a therapist and have to tell them about everything I went through makes me terrified. I do not want to talk about it I do not want to think about it. I am an introvert and my friends do not care about me much because they are having bfgf now. I am living really far away from my mom and I just cannot come home due to COVID and I cannot tell her how I actually feel. I have been pushing everyone away and this is my consequences. I just want to end this pain. I want to believe in God but why is my life so hard.. I feel disconnected to God Hes the only one I can rely on right now and I feel like there is no one left for me.. Why am i not making any progress?,Depression
12681,12701,As the title says I feel like a worthless member of society and of my household just leeching off others' work while I contribute nothing. I am 18 live with my parents and I have never cooked never done the dishes do not make my food do not do any household chores do not buy my own clothes do poorly at school I have no skills or hobbies. I sit at home playing videogames all day. My fucked up brain makes me unable to change anything even though I know that nothing should be like it is. Meds do not help therapy does not help I am just a lazy piece of garbage. I require others to work and care for me while I do NOTHING to give back. My self esteem is negative and if you hate me or are disgusted by me after reading this do not worry I am as well. I do not know what to do. I feel like a parasite,Depression
24874,24894,If any one cares to hear me out. I am crying and I feel like venting. I am a 26 year old woman with 2 kids 6 and 7. I feel so depressed and completely lost. I am married. I have been married for 8 years and things just get worse and worse between my husband and I. Long story short about infidelity. We had problems the first 2 years of marriage and he decided to bring one of his ex lovers to my house while I worked nights at the hospital. He said they only kissed but I could not get over it so I started talking to this guy and I kissed him but we never had sex. He hit me ten times harder and ever since he hardcore cheated on me around 3 times with 3 different women. He left me last year after we had fixed most of our issues and I was shocked he left because I thought we were OK. He started talking to this woman and he shamed me and my body and put me down so bad. He later apologized and said he made a big mistake and I took him back. We been back for about 8 months and he treats me worse than ever. The other day my car broke down in the middle of a busy street and I had my kids in the back. he came to help me and told me to pop the hood. I could not find the button. I guess I was nervous. He yelled at me so bad and called me stupid and so many names. He said I was an idiot and I should go seek help for my mental problem. Someone almost crashed me and the kids and I felt so scared. Instead of making me feel better he made me feel terrible. My mom tells me to leave him and go live with her but I do not want to go back with her. I had a terrible childhood with her and my dad. Although they are separated I still would not want to go live with my Mom and step dad. My mom is extremely religious and told me that If I go back I have to stick to her religion and marry a man from the religion and I will be restricted to hang with world people which are normal people outside the religion and I would not go live with my Father because he is a narcissist who emotionally abused me my mom and sister. Also was violent most of the time. I cannot run to my sister because she is emotionally bruised too living with severe depression. My aunt advised me to use my husband and finish my college degree and get a job and leave him but sometimes I feel like I am no smart enough to do this. A lot of questions come to my mind like? what if I am not smart enough to finish school and get. a job. Sometimes I just want to runaway and leave him but I have no where to run to. I feel so lost and depressed. he is a narcissist as well. Not as terrible as my dad but sure reminds me of him. I feel lost and broken and I have no other family to rely on. I have seeked professional help but It did not help much. I do not know what to do. I just sit and cry and cry sometimes I cannot stop the tears. I feel like I am a weak person. I constantly ask my self why cannot I toughen up why am I like this? my self esteem is all time low. I do not know what to do anymore Depressed and feeling lost CALIFORNIA,Depression
9528,9548,Their are other 19 year olds out there with relationships full time jobs their own bloody house... hell some of them are even having kids... what the actual fuck am I doing?I am nearly 20 and I have not fucking achieved anything. Never had a girlfriend no plans for the future. So fucking pathetic. What the fuck am I doing,Depression
26323,26343,I have no idea what to do at this point. I have had sleeping problems for years but it was never TOO crippling just falling asleep would take me 23 hours sometimes so only some time wasted but I would usually temporarily fix it every few weeks. But For the past 4 or 5 months it got so bad that most of my time was spent in bed falling asleep would take 45 hours and sometimes I would not even get any sleep at all at times 2 nights in a row and during the day I would feel like a zombie. And absolutely no method worked. Tried meditation exercises changing my diet meds drugs even getting drunk to sleep where I typically never drink. Would have completely botched my university semester if not for online lessons and cheating on exams like crazy. Fixing the sleep schedule was my main goal for those past months and since a week ago I actually did it. Regularly going to sleep and waking up at consistent hours for 68 hours of sleep. Problem is I still feel just as tired and lethargic. Starting to suspect it is really just the stress and me being unable to deal with insecurities and past traumas. Everything I do either fails or frustrates and tires me. I would often draw to relax and try working on creating my own video game since it is been my dream for years but I am absolutely unable to focus on either. I do not even have anyone to talk to about it. My family never understood me and we are on bad terms for some years anyway. The friends I have had for years are only called friends because I dislike the word buddies. Recently I got closer to a group of people online who I care for deeply and do my best to support when they have it hard but I realized it is not a mutual feeling and whenever I would bring up some of my issues they would often get dismissed or met with a lol or the attention would go to someone else mentioning their problem. At this point I do not really care though. I just want to be able to focus on stuff I am doing. I am sick of wasting time doing nothing. I tried various nonprescription meds to help concentrate but nothing works and when I would ask a doc to give me strong stuff back when I was looking for sleeping pills or the like he would refuse saying that I will only get addicted and ruin my health. My passions and pastimes no longer give me any joy and I cannot do them. Can medicine help? What kind? What to do?,Depression
27102,27122,I have this weird thing that when I fuck something up I gey depressed. Then to help battle this I try to be nice and to something good for somone else. Then if I fuck that up too I get this amount of depression where all I want to do is curl up into a ball in a dark closet and cry myself to sleep... Anyone else get this if is it just me? Try to be nice and feel sad,Depression
18647,18667,For many days I have been wondering what is the fastest way to die. And then it Subway trainstrains. Jump in front of a moving train and that is a fast way to die. Painful I am sure. But I do not know how you walk away from being squashed by a train.Disclaimer I am not encouraging anyone to do this method. I could be wrong with my opinions. I am typing all of this while being incredibly suicidal so sue me. Fast Way to die,Depression
8692,8712,I m sick and tired on how my life's goingi know it sound so cliche but that how I being truly feeling recentlyI feel like everyday my life's going downhill. it is been like a month since I have been feeling like this. I WAS not this type of a guy . I do not feel like working out which I used to love doing for like 45 times a week. I have been eating less and less everyday I got a lot of assignment and studying pending too but I just cannot do it. I only get motivation to work for max an hour or two only when the work is really important otherwise I spend most of my day laying in my bed I just do not like how everything is going recently I just want my motivation back so that I get back to my normal life back I want my motivation back,Depression
18722,18742,I stopped drinking for a couple months almost. I got drunk like 34 times in the span of 3 months. But the last time I was drinking i blacked out and drove an hour away and crashed my car into a field. I already have a suspended liscence I must have ran off the road. I called my old friend and he helped me out told me to hang out with him and his friends. TW TW TW I woke up to him behind me and then started touching me and apparently we hooked up that night. I do not know if we had sex or not. What if we did and he yanno. I am on birth control I have an IUD but still. He paid for my tow truck for me. I am humiliated and disgusted with myself. I am insanely lucky no one was hurt. I am insanely lucky the police did not show up. Now I just have to pay for damages. I told my family that I deer came in front of me so I swerve doff the road. Taking it to the car shop soon. I am so full of shame and guilt. And I feel really dirty. It is crippling. I detest myself. Crashed sky car when drunk.. again,Depression
23831,23851,WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I am NOT TRYING TO BRAG NEITHER BE COOL I UNDERSTAND HOW BAD DRUGS ARE FOR YOU. I am a 16 yo from brazil. Before may i had never even took any drugs only a few sips here and there and puffed a cigarette once. I spent well over 3 years addicted to video games and stayed inside all day. In february i weighted about 220 pounds and had no friends. So in may i reconected with an old friend my age I have known since the age of 5. Basically since the start of the year I have lost 45 pounds because i would walk for hours straight and not eat a single calorie the whole day and since may I have been using weed alcohol xanax and others drugs pretty much every week and lsd a few times. I am also addicted to cigarettes i smoke a pack of marlboro reds pretty easily within 2 days. Every time i get high i feel fucking amazing timeless i do not even know how to explain it. I do it because i hate myself i do not see any future for myself so why not enjoy it while i have not killed myself yet? Sounds really childish i know but i simply do not care anymore. All my friends have similar problems but they have plans and stuff at least potential. Sometimes friends or girls compliment my looks or my personality but i cannot even comprehend it i feel completely fucking worthless all the time so i just write it off as them being kind. I feel sorry for my mom and dad they gave me alot of trauma i know how much it will probably effect them but i just cannot help it. I do not want to stop but i know i should before i get addicted to harder drugs because i know i will. I am sorry to those who love for being selfish. Depression and Teenage drug use,Depression
21771,21791,Every single night I stay up late overthinking and anxious about how and where I am in my life. I watch tens of videos on YouTube read articles and other people's experiences and plan to wake up with a new attitude a maximumproductivity version of me and yet all of it automatically vaporizes in thin air when I wake up with a sour face and a grumpy mood. What do I do? I know I need to take little steps and that Rome was not built in a day but why cannot I find the motivation to study workout or improve my life by even one percent? I want to actually improve my life instead of just dreaming about it.,Depression

11973,11993,Last week I slept with a married couple I am a man it was my first time receiving anal sex. We wore protection for anal and vaginal but not oral. I did not feel comfortable giving head without protection but it was expected of me anyway. He came in my mouth unexpectedly which I really did not want.They told me they would happily get tested if I requested it but that was before I slept with them. Now that I have asked them to get tested they are ignoring me and acting like its a ridiculous thing to ask. The guy was gross I felt disgusted after sleeping with him. I only did it because his wife is a 1010 I have no idea why she is with him. This entire experience left me feeling like I am not bisexual after all.I have told my friends I had a really bad experience last week but men just do not give a shit about things like that. They just make jokes to try to ease the tension. Made me feel like shit. And I am too ashamed to even suggest this experience to my female friends.I hate myself for this I am worried about my health. I have had a sore throat ever since we hooked up and am going to get tested next week. But HIV and hepatitis require you to wait 12 weeks for an accurate result.I feel used and dirty. I hate this couple they are such bastards. I have no outlet for my frustration and I can feel myself spiraling. Had a bad sexual experience and now really depressed with no support system,Depression
8323,8343,I just do not feel like doing anything anymore let it be playing with my animals three dogs and two cats going outside assisting my dad with work hanging out with friends or anything really.I am already a mess. I stay up all night just laying in bed. I stopped doing the things I love and just stopped caring about everything.People always say the same thing. Get a therapist or it will be better soon. I know they are lying though. I have been like this for about five years now. Heh my dad always says that he gets it. However he does not. He does not feel like he is constantly drowning in sorrow.I cannot get a therapist because then I will have to use my parent's money and then they will find out how I am and I do not want that. I do not want their pity.ampx200BSorry for the rant and waste of time for those who read this. I feel so useless,Depression
9507,9527,I used to be okay. That is until I got hooked to antianxiety medication. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has changed the course of my life.Nowadays I see the world differently. I used to feel part of it. I used to feel like I had a place here. Lately I have felt like an outsider. Like I do not belong. I see people with their morning routines and just think I wish I had some structure like them. I do not have structure. I feel like an alien. Every single person I know has some sort of structure. I do not. I went from feeling like water inside a cup to water being thrown out onto the street. My life was okay on Benzos. I could function without much anxiety. But I saw the writing on the wall. I was addicted to them. I could not do much without them but when I was on them I was carefree risktaking and relatively happy. A lot of good happened in my life. I got married was doing well at work and finally felt free from my anxiety. Something Id dealt with since I was young. From ages 2428 I was under the influence of Xanax or Klonopin. Little did I know with every dose I was screwing my brain up. With everincreasing dosages my doctor eventually stopped prescribing them after 3 12 years. I was at a high dose of 4mg Klonopin. Early this year is when my life was turned upside down when my prescription was cut off. I did not think much of it. Until a few days later when my body started shaking and I got violently sick. I did not know what was happening neither did my wife. I started googling benzo withdrawal and found this subreddit and concluded that it was in fact the klonopin. 6 months later I am at a lower dose .5mg. I should feel accomplished. I should feel like I am making progress but in fact I feel defeated. I am so tired. I am so worn out. I barely sleep and I am anxious all day. I am terrified of the real world. I have zero confidence in myself. I feel like a total loser. I could cry ever single day. I do not know what is wrong with me. If I had known that Id suffer this way due to Klonopin I would have told the doctor to shove it down his own throat. This has taken my dignity my will to continue and my confidence for the future. I do not know what to think anymore. So very confused,Depression
12954,12974,Sometime these symptoms this year hit me. I thought I would never be subjected to depression because I have never had it in my life but that is clearly quite the contrary. I truly feel sorry for those who deal with it their entire life it is so debilitating and can limit what someone is true potential is if not handled just right.A primary care provider I do not usually stick with one because I barely used to go or I move prescribed me ADHD meds generic Ritalin and Adderall they just made me feel like even more so of a zombie that 1 hated life and 2 had had energy for part of the day. Thankfully I was finally referred to a doctor with a psychiatric background that they are double booking to see me on Monday. I am so thankful he is doing that for me. And I am also thankful my state has allowed me to stay on state insurance while the pandemic goes on. Its ironic I barely utilized my insurance up until it is about to be cancelled once the state declares the pandemic is over I graduated and got a job during the pandemic that makes a bit over the amount you are allowed to make and be disqualified for free state insurance. I hope it goes well and I get some better guidance to put me back on track.I know life can suck a ton and even finding a doctor can be a huge hassle but it is worth it in the end. Connect with a doctor about your depression. Find your true self that is trapped within. Baby steps are still better than no steps. Treat yourself like a loved one you deserve to be happy. Motivation disappeared everything feels like a chore gym progress sucks tired brain fog,Depression
20505,20525,I have suffered from chronic depression caked with anxiety for my whole life. it is an inherited thing so no getting rid of it. Maybe I will not have kids but I try to look at my life as a gift with an obstacle. When people do not know you have depression it is like they feel the need to point out everything that is wrong with you and when you are happy you do not understand how important that is to you.it is so hard for me to find something that lifts me but I have realized that there are things that exist for each and every person that feel like a calm bubble of air after drowning for what feels like an eternity. it is hard for other people to understand why I get so happy over things like this even my friends who suffer with the same thing as me but I am so happy because for a short moment I get to experience joy and I want to savor it and feel the breeze of relaxation on my nerves. The thing that cheers me up the most is music. If life were perfect everyone would be kings and queens and everyone would be allowed to dance and have fun while listening to it all. I cannot speak for everyone but I can say that this gleam of light has made me feel so much better about life. Maybe some of you guys who suffer with depression can think about something that makes you guys happy and try to make the most of it from now on.For those of you who feel like me what things lift you up and make you happy? I appreciate everything that makes me happy,Depression
27255,27275,When I met my gf a year ago I was at a point in life that I never wanted to see again. Now I am at that point again. My gf even decided to take a break from me because she said she cannot deal with me and needs to figure out if she wants to continue the relationship. To someone who already thought he hit rock bottom this shattered me. She was the only hope I had and the only person that actually made me want to get out of this hole and get better. Now I feel like I even lost that. All reasons to live just gone like that. And I did something which I promised not to do I wrote a suicide note. I feel like I need help but I do not know what to do. I cannot anymore,Depression
10213,10233,I mentioned to a close friend that I was dealing with a lot of anxiety and feeling really bad this week. I did not really expect their reply. It was along the lines of individual stuff does not matter right now the world's in crisis. I was really hurt because it just felt like having my struggle belittled and also I was angry because I found it hard to believe that with the level of mental health awareness these days that someone could say something so off when it is not even like I often vent first time in half a year I have even opened up so I know I am not a burden. I got angry told them and then got sadder told them that too. It started badly with them saying that I was taking offence at nothing ended better but i feel pathetic now having to explicitly ask a close friend to treat me properly. This has set me off on a shamedepression spiral and I have been crying and cannot get out of bed since. Just feeling worse and worse piling shame on top of shame. I have been good for months but my mental health feels totally derailed. do not know what I am asking really just suffering and needed to vent. Triggering conversations with friends,Depression
19505,19525,This is not how I feel all the time but when I do it hits hard. I have felt like I could break down at any moment for the past month or so. I do not want to mention it to anyone I know especially people who actually care about me because 1. there is nothing they can do about it 2. People start to treat you differently 3. People get upset when they know you are upset and that makes me more upset4. Most people can probably tell I am not in a great place just by the look on my face and my tone of voice and prefer to stay out of itSo I am sharing my feelings with you wonderful people instead. do not feel obligated to try to help. It just helps me a little to know that someone is listening. Existence is pain,Depression
13189,13209,I have gone through multiple periods of major depression that sometimes lasted years. I have tried countless medications while seeing many psychiatrists and psychologists. I am dyslexic and I was physically and emotionally abused as a child. I come out of it by just trying to improve my situation as much as I can no matter how hopeless it seems because its the only good strategy. No matter how hopeless it seems it can all turn around in six months. Random bad things will adversely affect us but so will random good things. Do what you can with diet exercise meditation prayer if that works for you. You can come out of your depression.,Depression
24234,24254,I wake up feeling really down and proceed to go about my day feeling really depressed and not being able to do much. I curl up in the evenings and just lie on my bed feeling like complete crap over my body how I will never be the girl I want to be and then I will spend half the night in tears not being able to sleep. I find this really takes a toll in my relationship with my boyfriend and this leads to more fights because I am distant or that I seem uninterested.I really wish I could have a minute of peace even doing activities rarely takes my mind off of all the dysphoria.

41188,41185,my anxiety and depression ha been through the roof these past few week i can feel myself taking it out on others it s not intentional but it just happens i think it s time to take a few step back from everything and focus more on me and my mental health,Depression
16710,16730,I thought it would be nice to relax and meditate. I guess I did not think about the sharing and connecting with others part of it. Every time I had to share I almost died of anxiety. Questions like What do you fear? and other things I have not even told my therapist.At the closing we went around in a circle and each person shared a special moment they had with another person on the trip how that moment made them feel and that they now feel complete.I do not know what I expected but I was the only person that was not chosen by anyone in the group. I could not really think of anything to share either but it hurt. It really hurts. Like just in case I forgot this was a reminder that I literally do not fit in anywhere and am incapable of forming connections with others. I am so stupid to have forgotten exactly how broken I am. I do not know what I was thinking. And now I cannot stop crying in this airport shuttle and I really hope no one notices. I am so stupid to have come here. I am so stupid to think that anyone could ever do more than just tolerate me. I am so stupid to think that I could ever belong anywhere. I went to a yoga retreat,Depression
38661,38658,i wanted to share some of what i ve written because i find that writing is an outlet that help me to calm down sometimes i sit in a room full of people and stay quiet the loud chatter and the chaos of laughter will fill the room fill my head yet i keep my opinion and question to myself i keep my thought contained in my mind i watch a the girl who betrayed me smile and continues to talk i watch a my friend all happily converse with one another i watch a the boy throw their head back unable to control their laughter they ask if i am okay more quiet than usual and all i can say is that i am tired what they do not know is that i am not physically tired but mentally exhausted my mind is constantly racing overthinking every word that leaf my tongue every move i make and every awkward gesture that display itself during conversation with people i need a rest,Depression
38485,38482,i love my family i have a slightly distant yet mostly kind older brother a supporting and caring mother and a funny and relatable father i have a stable home life and have a roof over my head and i never starve i would say i have an amazing family and life yet i constantly ruin it i ve been sick and i ll probably need to repeat the grade even doing online course i don t know if i can even pas high school my parent have spent a lot of medical fund for a useless child i have no friend since covid started due to online course and the only people that i constantly to other than my family are doctor and my tutor i make sure that my family never find out i m suicidal though they don t need any more problem i don t even know if you would call me a suicidal a i only have suicidal thought daily i don t cut myself or do anything like that but the reason is because i want to see my family in japan one last time before i die we re going on a trip to japan this summer and that s the sole thing i m living for i m scared of the thought of what will happen to me once i no longer have anything to look forward to i know that at this point i ll probably kill myself the second we come back here at least i ll be known a the cousin who probably died first instead of the suicidal one or a drug addict i know how much my entire family pretend my cousin who is a drug addict doesn t exist so i know the horrid backlash that would occur if i survived i know that if i fail dying i ll fake a recovery before properly offing myself sorry this ended up turning into a suicide idolization rant if you managed to even read it this far i bet your thinking why don t i just get a therapist therapy solves everything not i had a therapist for a whole month and i hated the judging eye the subtle why are you here you have a great life and the fact that they treat you like some kind of test subject orochimaru like creepy people i honestly managed to connect more with my tutor that i ve only known for month who i only met once every two week on zoom never met her in person now i bet your thinking wait why did you contradict yourself you said that your family didn t know you are suicidal and yet you had a therapist it wa because i had to go to so many doctor so often that mother thought about my mental health and gave me a therapist i had the therapist or month before my mother decided that i wa just fine i thank my ability to hide suicidal thought well thank you reddit for letting me make this confession i felt like i needed to say it somewhere where no one would ever find out who i am,Depression

20245,20265,I do not know how I am feeling. Everytime I have not so pleasant thoughts I feel like I am lying to myself? I do not know. I cannot afford a check up or anything of sorts right now and I am not even sure if I want to know. it is been like this for a few years now where I just do not feel right... Feels a bit empty but when I say that out loud to myself I feel like I am just lying to myself or to others. Sorry for how all over the place this little rant thingy is. I have never really put this into words before. I do not know,Depression
19389,19409,Is it even possible for me to live a happy fulfilling life? Will I ever be genuinely happy again?,Depression
19385,19405,I have never been happy with who I am even as a kid I always wanted to be someone else . Even in video games I am never satisfied with most of the characters I create cus simply because I am the one playing them . I do not know how to be content w who I am at all I hope I am not like this for my whole life Conclusion I have always hated myself,Depression
11952,11972,I have stopped talking to everyone around me. I just want to sleep and do nothing. I feel nothing and I lost motivation to do anything. I just want to keep sleeping and escape life. But even then life takes that away and does not let me sleep. People tell me Ill feel better if I go outside or if I force myself to do anything. But I cannot. I just want to keep sleeping. I have stopped going outside I stopped talking to people. And I feel so guilty because of it. I feel as if I am leaving my friends behind and making them feel as if I do not give a shit about them. But I just want to sleep. that is all that keeps me happy now. Its all I have left Just want to keep sleeping,Depression
25451,25471,I kind of hate earth. I have thought of dying once or twice. I am an overthinker over dramatic and I cry myself to sleep every night.

12634,12654,I posted on other sub as well not fishing for anything just want to vent that is all.I am a lame and an ugly dude. Someone i knew once told me that i got a head that only a mother could love. Another one told me that I am lucky that i am a boy cuz no one would marry me if i were a girl. I rarely had any luck with girls. When i go out with my friend girls always fancy him. I never get any attention. Throughout my 24 years on this earth i can only think of three girls who were interested in me. One made out with me but stop halfway because I was inexperienced in kissing. The other two exchanged numbers but they never wanted to go out with me. The only thing i got going on in my life is my job as a mechanical engineer and potential inheritance from my parents. Everyday is sadness fest for me. I feel lonely. I always wonder what is it like to be in a relationship to have friends to talk to weekend plans to look forward to. I never look forward to going home after work instead i burry my sorrows with overtime. I want to have friends to go to festivals with. what is stopping me from achieving all of the things i listed are my insecurities about my look my lack of social skills due to years of oppression during my childhood my social anxiety and my looping depression.How can my life get better if i get nervous when talking people ? How can my hope to meet a romantic partner be actualised when I do not have the social skills ?How can develop my social skills when i get social anxiety when i am in a social setting ?I do not see a way out of this beside death and a really optimistic belief that i will go to heaven or reborn again as a penguin cuz they are cute.My constant suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger everyday and I have no one to talk too. This is my first time posting my feeling out in public I do not expect anything in return. I just want to vent out..I do not want to die but the pain is too hard to handle. I am so done but am I ready to end it ????,Depression
47922,47904,my friends are mad at me for being depressed a few of my friends randomly called me out today for always putting myself down and always being sadcrying for no reason and told me how annoying it is they also called out a few other disorders i deal withi told them i suffer with depression which they know and im seeing a professional to help me with it yet they still said it. making me feel 10x worse. i even apologised to thembut they picked apart my apology and created more problems so at this point i dont feel like trying anymore.i understand that dealing with depressed people can be a lot for some but most of the time i stay quiet when im sad. theyre the same ones who always preach how mental health matters on instagram but in reality they act like this. im not sure what to do. i dont have any other friends and some of my friends in that friend group are great but those few friends hurt my feelings so bad. do i just pretend to be happy around them? today i kept crying at school because of what they said to me and i fear tomorrow will be much worse. i hate attending school in the first place but this makes it so much worse,Depression
39490,39487,i ve been on medication prescribed by my primary care doctor my therapist noticed my depression anxiety remaining pretty high and told me to talk to my doctor about it my doctor increased my dosage but also want me to see a psychiatrist who can better analyze my issue he didn t give me a referral and said i can see anyone you want preferably someone that take my insurance he did give a list of a few psychiatrist though i have been looking through my insurance s website for a psychiatrist i have also just been searching online but i don t know which one to select what criterion should i look out for are online review reliable any advice would be appreciated,Depression
22821,22841,The career I chose is in the process of making me very rich but also extremely depressed and overworkedoverjudged to the point that I am having at least one episode a day where I want to curl up and disappear. Its a job that involves social media fame and the expectation of perfection. Sometimes I am not sure how much more I can handle as a human being before I break. I have not been able to make any real friends my family was never there to begin with my relationship was with someone who cared more about my pursuit of this than my own wellbeing people respect my name but almost daily disrespect my person if that makes sense and people are always watching what I do so I have to be so extremely careful that it almost feels like PTSD now. Most people around me want something out of me. I am also constantly comparing my body and myself to the next best thing because that is the type of industry I am in. Its mentally draining. I would not wish fame on anyone.I wanted to see if anyone out there has any advice for me? I am going to therapy but I am still having these super depressive episodes . I have a lot of regret of pursuing what I once loved so much because of everything I have had to sacrifice for success. Words of advice for the successful depressed?,Depression
21376,21396,will i ever be noticed? is my life worth anything? i spend all day doing nothing full of sorrow and pain while wishing pain on others. i waste my time day after day after day slowly killing myself mentally. the isolation is killing me. i have no one to talk to about it it feels like I am going to hurt myself or someone else but I am too afraid to act on it solely because i do not want to go back to the mental hospital. who am i? why am i here? what is my point anymore? i do not want to waste away like this i work so hard to get better my days always start off promising but go to shit quickly. it feels like life itself is playing me like a fiddle why though? what did i do to deserve this pain? I have been like this since i was a mere toddler so why me? did i commit a major sin in my past life? was there a past life? i do not know anymore. i wanted to grow up to help people to be a leader to change peoples lives for the better but now i will not be anything. at most ill be homeless at worst ill be dead but is it really that bad? is it bad to lose my life anymore? nobody would miss me. i destroyed all of my relationships. i only have my mother i love my mother she is been through so much she is so strong and I am so proud of her but i do not think i want to continue to live like this. i just want to escape i cannot embrace this life anymore for it has brought me to my knees. if anyone ever sees this i it will probably be after my death. so be it. nobody would miss me. i do not care anymore. i will not even miss myself. I am just too afraid to go through with it i do not have a gun i do not have anything of that sort so what do i do? i do not feel like a human. i feel subhuman i feel like nothing why was i born this way WHY? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO? I DID NOTHING. I JUST WANTED A NICE AND SAFE JOURNEY BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO GO INSANE FROM ISOLATION. this is not even mentioning all of the voices and stuff i see its probably due to loneliness i hear people calling my name a comforting girls voice a girl i do not even know a girl i will never know. right before i sleep i am haunted with the noises of people saying my name as if I am at my deathbed. i know it is unrealistic though. because no one would miss me in reality. I am a nobody i do nothing to help other people I have been a mental cripple my entire life. its only become apparent recently when all of my friendships came falling down solely because i am a horrible friend and horrible narcissistic degenerate of a person in general. this is not even the worst I have felt last night was when i cried harder than I have ever cried i had to cover my mouth to prevent screaming i do not want my mom to worry about me. my mom deserves everything for how hard she works for me even after my dad died. i know my dad would be sad if i go through with killing myself but hes not here anymore hes in a better place. i know that my life is going to get worse from here my teenage years have just started and it feels like i am really losing my mind. do i deserve this? is this because of all my past mistakes? i do not know and i will not ever know. what hurts most is that everyone i know would tell me how much i change that i was not the same funny happy helpful me. that is what my friend told me right before we stopped talking. I am such a selfish fucking bitch. i always talk about other people not being empathetic but i myself am not empathetic and only paint myself to be so other people feel bad am i really just this bad of a person? is all I am looking for a reaction from everyone so that i can finally know they care or make them care? i do not know. i do not know answers to any of this. i feel like I am going insane with all these thoughts flowing around my head there is nothing that calms them anymore i am just filled with negative emotions and i have no way to control them. i know i will never be off meds. last time i was i was crying harder than i have ever cried and i had the worst homicidal thoughts. at this point its a struggle to keep myself from hurting myself and others. i bet it would be a lot better for everyone if i was gone nobody would be hurt. thank you if you read this whole thing. it feels like I am the only one alive like I am in a city at night snow all over with the streets being empty not a sign of life. i feel like this is a key part of my narcissistic thinking i believe that i am special in some way i am not but i think that to make myself feel better about being a nobody. I am done showing everyone empathy when they show not a single bit of concern back. am i really selfish for doing that when they do not do anything to make me feel better? nobody even comforts me anymore. i do not I am just sitting at my chair writing all day about my thoughts. not sure why its just addicting it makes me see the point I am at my thinking my supposed insanity. when will it get better? will it really ever get better? i do not feel angry anymore. I am just full of sorrow and pain. the mere hope that someone is sees what I am going through and helps out is the only thing keeping me going but i know at one point it will be gone. gone like my past self gone like my friends gone like my dad gone like everything i ever loved gone like all of my hopes and dreams. what if i show this to my doctor? would that help? or would he throw me in a mental hospital? I am already suspicous of the meds I am suspcious of everyone who works as a mental health professional they just work to make money off of peoples suffering that is what my brain tells me. i know its the truth because i have seen human greed for money and power. the current society is destroying the regular human while benefitting the small minority at the top. have i really made any progress in the last what year and a half? i do not feel like i have. it feels like everythings getting worse. everything has gotten worse. if my mother would to die that would be the final straw at that point i really have no one. my mother was right other people do not give a single FUCK about my problems. because they are all selfish and horrible people. everyone i know is i have not met a single person who is not. is it just me? or what? i find it funny how my important would go up if i committed suicide. if i killed myself right now everyone would come rushing not because they care but because they think they have the blood on their hands. they do not. its all on me I am the one who decided to take my life to begin with. i was not born on my own but i have the right to take my life because i will be preventing other people from harm. i am a danger to myself and everyone around me at this point. i feel like I am at the point in my life where there is nothing left to do but die. like i have the choice between sitting here having pain rotting away slowly or killing myself and getting over with it. i feel like i relate to my dad a bit when he was on the ventilator it was causing him pain that is why he had to be taken off. just like how i cannot stand the pain anymore the pain is going to continue till i take my life. I am tired of seeing everyone else succeed while I am sitting here crying about all my problems like the little bitch i am. I am jealous just another sign that i am indeed a horrible person. i have never been proud of myself nobody has ever been proud of me. i am a waste of oxygen people promise that they care but they are two faced liars. I KNOW IT. nobody would care about me simply because i do not benefit them in anyway. if i did benefit them they would care. does that just show my hipocrisy? that i am really just a selfish person too? this has myself at a loss of words because i was proven right by myself i am simply a horrible person. i am the type of person i hate. so why continue? what is my point then? just to sit and continue to feel sadness and anger? i keep remembering when i first started to hurt when i first was diagnosed with mental illness it was not a shocker it was not as bad as it is now. i feel paranoid what if the meds only make me feel worse? what if they just want me to get worse so i pay them money until i die? fuckers. i was proven right but this time about other people. when did it all go wrong i do not understand i say it started when i was young because i would harm myself hallucinate and have other symptoms but am i right? idk. i just want to be like everyone else my age. i do not want to be who i am right now feeling like a 25 year old man trapped inside of his apartment all day having no one to talk to and barely making by. the loneliness of this all the fear of missing out the want to be loved to be held to be cared for its killing me inside along with everything else. i will never experience love i will never experience true care i am too far gone at this point there is no fucking point anymore. i do not want to live anyways i will not experience the best things life has to offer. when i get my hands on a gun the first thing I am going to do is go out for a walk just enjoy the weather then end it. so it can end on a calming note. nobody will miss me at all not my mom she will probably be dead due to preexisting conditions i will not have anyone. why the fuck am i looked down upon by everyone for being mentally ill? it makes no sense to me. i feel like they are afraid of me not that they think they are better is this me anymore or this is something else? someone told me this is not me this is my mental illness what if i am my mental illness? i do not know to be honest. i think I am the real problem here i think I am better than others i think I am smarter better everything. I am just so unsure of everything now my future my life my relationships. I am slowly discovering that I am just a really toxic person why else would people start leaving me? its because i am objectively horrible. i do not care about anyone. i just want myself to be happy at the expense of others its ironic because i wanted to help others and wanted mutual trust but nope. i am really just this. i do not feel insane right now just sort of filled with thoughts feelings i do not feel emotions or any form of empathy anymore am i long gone? what happened to me? why does everyone say that the past me is gone why? i do not know what changed. i do not feel the same no but i do not know what changed either. i want to be the old me again I have been like this forever but it was not as severe before what made it severe? will i ever know? i think everyone i know thinks this is an act even when i tell them what is wrong they seem to ignore it they hope for the best but the worst keeps coming over and over every day. my life is at the same point it was at when i was almost admitted to the mental hospital which would have been the second time but i was able to hide it well enough to where they did not think i was completely crazy. i do not know how long i can keep hiding it i do not think i hide it anymore anyways i just think people stopped caring about it because it was not their problem. I am tired of not being noticed not being able to experience what others are experiencing i want to be like them i want to be happy i do not want to be what i am right now right now i am a complete and utter mess and i have nothing and no way to fix it. i do not know how long before i snap completely i already feel like i have. i do not know when i might do something irrational to someone else or myself the unpredictability of mental illness is what makes it so fucking bad. i just want to be happy. I am looking through all of my notes and seeing all my plans all my schedules everything i planned for the future plans that i will never be able to fulfill. if i were given the independence i seek so badly i would have ended myself is that a good thing? i do not know. i think it would be good for the world if i was gone i just feel like a burden to everyone at this point. i wrote a longer rant and bridged them all together plus some more thoughts should i talk to my doctor about this? i feel like he does not know what is wrong.,Depression

18412,18432,Hey all first time poster here. I need some help.Not too long ago my partner suddenly decided to cutoff all relations with me and it seems she no longer wants to be associated with me anymore. Apparently this was because her friends did not approve of me or something ? she explained how she still liked me but her friends thought that I was weird despite them not even knowing me so ig she just felt embarrassed being around me and so decided to leave me. that is essentially the message I got. honestly I am still so confused. she went from totally being in love with me for awhile then decided to break up with me seemingly over night. just because her friends did not like me or whatever.I spoke to a close friend of hers about it and they had their suspicions on jealousy and peer pressure which seemed to make sense ig but they also had no idea. I was not particularly keen on them asking her about it.Idek but I am absolutely gutted. I honestly loved her so much. I have been feeling so depressed lately. I literally lack the motivation to do well anything. I have not eaten much since then and I cannot even concentrate in class properly. Its horrible. I am so confused and frustrated I literally cannot stop thinking about her. It keeps me up at night.Do you all have any suggestions for me going forward? please help me! TT I feel lost and alone,Depression

47570,47554,Depressed GF f31 ended things with me m30 to not put me through it but I still want to support her. She was warming back up to me again and has since snapped about a job she asked me to do I have a situation that I wont go too much detail but Ill probably write a lot about itMy gfnow ex ended things last weekend because of her severe depression after she was crying about everything and didnt want to put me through it. She told me she always pushes everyone away. She lost her two year old boy three years ago and never got help to grieve. We also found she miscarried just before the weekend too however before this she told me she was not wanting the baby.The day after this happened I shut myself off from my phone and apparently she tried to contact me raced around to my apartment and was shaking giving me a big hug thinking id done something to myself wasnt my intention.Since then Ive felt down about it. I made it clear to her that I want her but I understand that isnt important right now and her getting better is key that I would stick by her no matter what. She appreciated this and said lets see what the future holds but that she needs space between us. I agreed and respected this. She also said she still loves me.She came over a couple of days ago and I was on the phone to customer service. When she spoke to them they asked who she was and she said his partner which confused me. She invited me to IKEA after I finished work so I could help her with buying stuff we went and got some food and overall we had a laugh like our earlier days.Im trying to give her space but she keeps contacting me about things in the apartment etc. Her mum had asked me to reset some laptops for her but I was given no deadline and had been very busy lately.My ex tried to call me multiple times this morning about the laptops but I was working. I called her on my break and she was very aggressive on the phone. I mentioned doing this as a favour but she called me an inconsiderate cnt because of what her mum had done for me. She also complained at me that if it wasnt for her nothing would have got done in our apartment and that she was in there today sorting stuff.What originally caused her to leave our apartment and go back to her mums were these low moments shed have lashing out because of her depression. My issue was id react to it turn it into something more and walk out the room so when she was being like this on the phone I wanted to be the opposite and tell her itll be okay and ill sort it. She spiralled into a meltdown with me and hung up.I sent a message after saying itll be sorted tonight and ill drop the laptops off that I do appreciate everything her and her mum have done.I just dont know what to do. I feel like this is a further step back and she now hates me. She seemed to be warming back up to me when we were at IKEA. I still want to be there and support her when she needs me but I feel like after this depression aside.. why would she even want to consider making a go of things with someone she sees as inconsiderate dragging feet etc. ?I plan to keep giving her space until she reaches out again but I keep thinking that in the long term Ive severed any chance of her returning. I want to show her Im not like that just Ive had to juggle everything so Im finding it difficult to complete jobs she wants alongside balancing my own lifeI want to support her through her depression so much I love her but it just feels like she hates me right now,Depression
38773,38770,although my colleague and bos have been really supportive and nice to me my mind tell me they secretly hate me or just won t express something they don t like of me in the fear that i m new i m socially awkward and many other thing about the job and conversation of the day echo loud in my head in repeat and i just can t think of anything else i scroll through the gram for distraction or read through my astrology happening for the day i don t know how to relax or quiet my mind so many thing bothering me at once,Depression

16771,16791,30 back in school for nursing but I feel like I am never going to be able to stand working because of my mental and physical illnesses. I have had diarrhea for a year with no signs of any physical causes. Its likely due to stress. I am just so unhappy and it makes me mad that I cannot experience positive emotions like a normal person. I do not enjoy anything. My husband is sick of me hes been staying with someone else for the past few weeks. I have tried plenty of meds psychotherapy but none of them have ever worked well. I weigh more than I ever have never get my period and have the worst acne of my life because of some hormonal issues from stopping my oral contraceptives in November in an attempt to help with my GI issues. Going on 6 years of the most intense depressive episode I have ever experienced and I just do not feel like I can do it much longer. I do not enjoy anything. Why do I have to try so hard to be happy when other people can enjoy life without this kind of struggle? I hate being alive feels like I am just not cut out for it. Its as if my mind and body are pushing me past my limits. I have hated myself for the past 20 years and I do not feel like Ill ever be content. Sick of clawing for a scrap of positive emotions,Depression

17935,17955,I feel so incredibly numb. Like I genuinely do not care about anything anymore. I do not see a future for myself I do not see tomorrow happening. I feel like I am living on some sort of play set and everything is so fake. I feel like I am on a tiny boat somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and everything is just so so far away. I want it all to end. I just want it to go back to how it used to be. But I know it will not. I want to die but I feel like even if I do that too will not be real. Nothingnobody feels like home anymore. I have not even graduated yet. Please get me out of this hellhole. I am so numb,Depression
8717,8737,How do you guys fight it? I get sad sometimes and it just stays. I want it to go but it does not bother to go away. No one is there to help. Loneliness is eating me alive. Why do I feel lonely even though I have a girlfriend? I have no idea. I do not always feel lonely just sometimes ig. This sucks this really sucks. I get suicidal sometimes but that would be selfish. But I cannot see the point anymore. What am I doing with my life? I am loved I think. Just little things affect me a lot sometimes like a bullet I think. it is not fair on people who care for me if I die but it should not be like that. I wish I could just erase my existence like stop my parents from conceiving me. that would be cool. I think I am overreacting but I am a sensible person. I tried getting help but my gp never got back to me. It sucks because I got accused of that I do not help myself. I tried and I did help myself. do not accuse people who are struggling I never do that because I know it has bad implications. If you are in a relationshipdo not guilt trip your SO over something they have no control over. that is all. Take care fellas My chest feels hollow,Depression

20523,20543,Sat at the drive through at freddys and just cried.. why? I watching a couple at the apple bees across the street and asked myself why do not I have anyone? Why does no one love me or want me? I have dated girls on and off.. my last one was my one. I loved her more then anything or anyone. She cheated lied was selfish a classic narcist and yet I stayed with her till she left. Now I sit back and just wonder why am I not allowed to have someone? To be happy? To at least achieve partial American dream.. now I am a single parent who is trying his best but feels left out in life. Sitting back watching others with complete families and me... go without. I dunno anymore. what is so wrong with me? Why does no one like me or love me? What is wrong with me?,Depression
25459,25479,I dislike my mother so much I believe it has crossed to hate. I hate she gave birth to me. I hate how I look. I see her features in my reflection and I breakdown crying. I do not want to look like her. My friends say I look better than her. I am beautiful. I am a good person. I care about others and think about the perspective of others. My mother only thinks about herself does not care about hearing me talk about anyone else that does not affect her. She hated the idea of me volunteering that I kept it hidden. I never told her all the volunteering I did at school and after. I know she is not a good person. My close friend even suggested I should change my name or middle name all together. I am a cis female who goes by a different female name because I can hear her voice when I hear my name. My mother tried to raise me with advice but she never raised me. All the help I should have had the eating habits eating veggies not sweets see doctors see specialists social skills everything a parent should do for their child she did not. She could have kids so she did. She has issues that my friend told me I need to learn how to work with kids because she is like one. She lived in outdated times and would refuse to listen to change. She may have loved my birth father but come to ask anything about him she has no clue. This man is who she chose to have as a father? She does not know anything about him. My friend says she has trauma from all her life. Why did she give birth? It is likely nobody would like her so she created friends. I am older. I can change a lot but a lot is too late. The damage is done. I am likely to kill myself at some point because as I progress in life with changes I can make I have to deal with the permanent damage that affects my quality of life. The sad part is if we had universal healthcare I could try and fix some of the damage. I see her reflection,Depression

26069,26089,I am stuck. it is so frustrating.I know there is a way to make me feel better. I known I am capable of doing things. Then why cannot I do it? I am just here procrastinating wasting my time. it is been months years even. I just cannot do stuff. I cannot get up and do crap. Am I lazy? Am I arrogant? I am angry at myself I am so unhappy. There is so much goals I know I can reach that would make me so happy but I just do not. I do not understand what is going on in my own head. I feel stuck in my body and I see the days pass and I am doing nothing. I feel helpless useless. I am so angry at myself. I feel so alone. I feel so highly of myself but I accomplish nothing. I used to make stuff that made myself proud but then I stopped. it is so stupid???? I want to do things for me. I want to do things that are for my own benefit. I want to put effort into achieving stuff so why??? Is it selfish? Is it ok to want that? I want to be a good person and a stable person and I want to be busy and healthy but right now I am just a dead weight. I am so angry I know what I need to do and what I want to do but I cannot.,Depression

7687,7707,Its taking a toll on our relationship and I do not know how to help. I do not deal with depression anxiety or any other mental health issues. It makes it really hard to relate. She does not want to seek professional help as she is said in the past that when she is gone before she never knows what to say.

20826,20846,I spent my childhood putting all my energy into surviving emotional abuse from my parents and I have spent whole years of my life completely alone with minimal human contact basically just my immediate family and the odd delivery person so despite nearly being 28 years old I have not developed the same social skills most people my age have for example I have had sex exactly one time and I have never been in a relationship this lack of social skills has caused problems in my relationships with people to the point where not understanding the full subtleties of situations has destroyed my reputation in some circles and even cost me employment thinking about the problems I have caused for people just makes me want to shut out the world and hide from everyone but speaking from experience being away from the world for long periods of time makes my mental health worse and further erodes my nonexistent social skills so I force myself to work make friends and go out despite the constant existential dread I feel in the background I know I am burning the candle at both ends here and eventually I will probably snap and go back to my reclusive lifestyle but I see no other way forward but to force myself out of my extremely limited comfort zone and try to have as much of a life as possible even though it gets more and more stressful to maintain as time goes by I have this constant overwhelming urge to become a recluse,Depression
15872,15892,I have had depression for years now in fact I am pretty sure I have had it my whole life. I have learned how to mask it how to make those around me beleive that I am fine out of fear that they would discover that there is something wrong with me that I am broken.I have had help and therapy in the past but my coverage basically gives me the trial period of help then I have to pay for it myself. I am on the east coast of Canada and mental health support here is almost a bigger mess than I am. that is what I do I use humour to mask the fact that I am falling apart and dying inside. I grew up in a house where I was the butt of every joke any attempt to dish it back resulted anger because they could dish it but they cannot take it. So I had to learn to take it after all it is just a joke. I have been plagued with self loathing and doubt my entire life heck I am using a throwaway because even at 39 I am still scared for people to find out that I am broken. Anytime I have tried to pick up a new hobby something to take my mind off things it ends the same way. I start enjoying myself but those same old thoughts keep floating back in you are not good enough you cannot afford to continue this hobby why are you even trying there are so many people better than youThe 2020's have been devistating to me I was just starting to feel like I was getting my life back on track things were looking up. Boom lockdown okay I can handle this...I could not. When I finally got back to work I could not focus the thoughts had already started again and the quality of my work suffered. Then due to company restructuring I lost the job that I had been able to hold the longest. 6 years in and now I am unemployed again struggling to pay bills. Thankfully my wife started a new full time position so money wise were okay but now I am watching her with her life together with her higher education realising that I will never be able to reach that level. I have had people suggest mindfulness and to not listen to those thoughts or find something to distract you from those thoughts. What if I cannot? What do I do when there is nothing to distract me? What do I do if I cannot get out of my own head? What do I do when all evidence points to the thoughts being true? What do I do when I cannot get out of my head?,Depression
11866,11886,What is the easiest least painful way to off yourself Easiest way to,Depression
27111,27131,I am on 100mg dose. They are helping me cope a little but I have never felt more alone recently. I lost people who I could turn to and every night these dreams will not stop. it is constant nightmares and my worst fears always manifested. I wake up more drained and exhausted than before sleeping. I just miss being able to rest. I just want a break from everything just go to nowhere and be nothing and rest. it is so soul crushing and I feel trapped inside. I used to love sleep now I hate sleep and I hate being awake. I have no break from anything and it is getting too much. Zoloft Dreams are ruining my life,Depression
14638,14658,I have been feeling like everything is increasingly hopeless and my thoughts have been getting darker and emptier. i want to end it all because i feel like those around me would be better off and the one person i thought would care told me that she does not want anything to do with me anymore I have started having suicidal thoughts again,Depression
47178,47166,Confused about reason So at the current time in my reality I finished school around 2 years ago and have been jobless since I've been living with my family. The days have become dull and timewasting I feel like my time sleeping and dreaming is more fulfilling and lively for me than being awake... When I wake up I turn on my computer and if I'm not doing something with my family I'll sit for 1214 hours a day with breaks of making food and stuff... Everything has become obscurely pointless I feel like I'm wasting my life on temporary things... A part of me just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering while the other part wants to start and become something grand. I despise how society is built everything feels so complex and demanding. Many times again I've wished that the world was of a past era a downgrade if you will where economy complexity orderliness greed and money wasn't discovered. Anyways probably gonna feel better tomorrow.,Depression

8874,8894,So I tend to get depressive episodes on a fairly regular basis when I am at optimal mental health I get mild to severe dips like a week before my cycle that then go away within a few days but I have been having some longer than normal ones lately and I have been stuck in that sinking black hole for about two full weeks now. Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety I sometimes do not take jokes very well especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or in rare cases until I start crying. A lot of times their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of. and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love as well as mental heath topics when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way. This is easily the worst I have been mental healthwise in like a year and I am starting to struggle a little and letting the bad thoughts linger. Sorry for the long post. there is a lot going on in my head and my life that I need to parse through I guess. Been A Little Rough Lately,Depression
38194,38191,the note is done written edited signed done the noose is cinched and hung all that s left is for me to decorate the door i stood staring at it for what felt like an eternity today every second had felt like eternity i had writhed in agony watching each minute tick by a if a lifetime had passed i had tried everything i knew and i d been told dunked my face in cold water but my forehead had felt red hot meditated and focused on my breathing but i d retreat back into my head between each breath and be left gasping for air took a scalding bath for a moment i wa in my skin again but then the water and i felt a one i tried to nap a reset wa always in store but i woke up still at death s door i hadn t done it yet though i d never been closer but i still hadn t done it before i hit send before i decorated the door i told myself i d go for one last run to get out of my head i ve been treading water the last week just barely keeping my head up i tried mushroom a few day ago and for the first time in what felt like month could accept myself in fact i discovered i wa stuck in time two month earlier when i d been dumped my heart hadn t moved on but the universe relentlessly had and for hour the mushroom gave me clarity that i needed to move on and even had there wa a moment when time seemed to stop and suddenly i wa vaulted forward to the present over and around the intervening month i wa present again but just a sudden a the revelation had fallen upon me it wa stripped away and the black dog weighed down my chest once more shakily i put on my running clothes i considered my route an old standard roughly mile it d buy me a calculated more minute to think about this decision i cinched my lace i hate these shoe i struck out the door when my foot hit the pavement i realized this wasn t a regular jog i wasn t running to run i wa running to kill myself or not i d find out along the way suddenly the route and distance didn t matter i knew i d be going further than i d thought i started out at a normal pace and began upping my tempo i knew i wa out of shape i knew a single minute mile would be my limit a it had been on several of the past day but today wasn t those day i couldn t feel the exhaustion the pain of my body moment earlier all i could feel wa my body exhausted i wa trapped in my head i could push my body well past it s limit today because i wasn t leaving my heart or my head until my body hurt more around the first mile i started muttering to myself you ve never outrun yourself before but today is the day you beat yourself and i kept running i came upon a long flat stretch a narrow catwalk along the water s edge and i broke into a sprint i wa going to break myself now i pushed until i could feel the burn in my leg my throat and my lung i hadn t pushed myself like this in day week month or maybe even year i d forgotten what it felt like i started feeling light headed this wa to be alive but it couldn t last i ground to a halt and walked finally outside my head again but still thinking finally not drowning in my thought i d realized earlier what it is in those last moment it is quite literally drowning in your thought my brain take over dwelling on my past failure rejection loss and it s a if every iota of my brain power is diverted to these fruitless foray in my hippocampus every drip of processing is diverted suddenly my breathing reflex kick in i haven t been breathing i ve been drowning in my thought and with it a sense of fear and dread adrenaline course through my aorta spreading across my chest and dilating my bronchus fight or flight from my own past pushing myself achieves this same end but what am i running for what am i running toward i don t know and i feel so lost and unbound adrift and asea i thought again if this is your last run you re going out strong and started sprinting again i ran and i ran and i ran i ran through throng of people amidst cherry blossom who didn t know i wa probably running to my death but suddenly i didn t want to die anymore at least not yet not now and i started a new mantra this run saved my life and i realized i could say that every time i ran or biked or hiked or sat with friend or worked on a project or spoke to my mom but to do so i d have to get through those long dark minute of pure and intense pain i d have to learn to hurt myself again running hiking biking but i kept running a fast and a hard a i could i circled back around on my path it wa a lollipop route and i wa completing the candy and i pushed myself until i wa back on the inner leg of it the stem i pushed myself so hard i started vomiting in a homeless camp of all place i d had nothing to eat today and little yesterday i wa subsisting on coffee the bile came up black sour bitter much a the coffee had been going down it seemed a funny parallel and i decided then that i wanted to write about this i wanted to share my story because today i didn t kill myself i might have some part of me wanted to but i ran away and i ll keep running it s tough but i think i found something to run for again i d mostly stopped running age ago but i think this wa the motivation i needed to start again the rest of my life is in shamble and i don t know what i m doing but i can keep running i ll start running with a group i think and each time i ll let them know at the end this run saved my life i ll let them decide what that mean to me and them,Depression
10372,10392,Hi. I have quite alot of joint pain in my back knee and neck area and apart from the hernia problem in my lower back which is very small I have heard that some of the joint pain can be psychological. Has anyone here had any luck with prozac making joint pain better? I am not on any meds rn. Prozac,Depression
23751,23771,I am the worst person ever. I cannot even do one thing expected of me. I am dependent on my family who do so much for me and I never pay them back. I hate myself. I am detestable. My life sucks but I made it suck and I give them pain. I will hate myself even more in 3 months and idk how to make it stop. I hate myself and maybe I will never stop,Depression
19482,19502,The past couple of months have been a mess. I have gone through a break with the person I truly expected to spend the rest of my life with my job has been unbelievably stressful I live in a city 5 hours away from my townhome where all my friends and family are. I have very few friends here and the times I do go out I am overcome with crazy social anxiety and do not want to talk to anyone. I also live alone and spend most nights by myself. I see a therapist weekly and immediately after my sessions I do feel better. But it does not feel like I am making much progress and I am wasting my money. Recently I have been more reckless than normal ie. driving wayyy over the speed limit zig zagging in and out of traffic and blacking out more often than Id like to admit. Even though I am not suicidal I wrote out a suicide note to address my friends and family just to see what I would say to them. I realized how little I had to say and felt really inconsequential. I am trying to take everything day by day but I am fearful that it will get to the point where I cannot take this no more. I do not want to die but I cannot seem to make my life more fulfilling and worthwhile. Its just starting to get to be too much. I just want to know if anyone has any advice or strategies to put themselves in better situations Looking for fulfillment in life,Depression
17598,17618,I think a mildly low feeling all the time just is not enough to make you want to do something about it.When you get right to the bottom of the pit you get stopped by the floor and realise where you are and think shit I want out now!You realize how shitty the very bottom is. I think sometimes it takes being as low as possible to get motivation to get out.,Depression

Used to have a good life enjoyed my hobbies and actually enjoyed living. It stresses me out that time is constantly changing and there is a chance I will be like this forever. I just want to go back to the old days every single day I want to go back. I do not find enjoyment in anything anymore. Every day is the same,Depression

47163,47151,how did you know that you wereare depressed and not just mentally exhausted or burned out? both depression and mental exhaustion or burnout share a lot of the same things no energy to do things bad sleep not in the mood to do things a very bad memory and not able to remember things not being capable of having fun because you feel so tired you want to do things but are just not able to do so cause you feel so crappy getting angry or irritated at everything and everyonehow did you know that you wereare depressed and not just mentally exhausted or burned out?I learned that a depressed person might still want to do things but feel so tired and don't enjoy the things they wanna do or used to enjoy.i had some kind of medical form with a lot of questions and the result is that i have a very high score on distress and depression but depression can cause high distress symptoms and high distress can cause depression symptoms.Anyone who can share some information?Ps they claim i am clinically depressed for a few years now but i don't wanna die i also don't care if i live or die. If i die then so be it.,Depression

24673,24693,Most depressed people do not eat and lose weight. I wish I was like that. Since I was a kid I looked to food for comfort. I have been chubby my whole life because of it and that severely affects my self esteem. After having a severe depressive episode 2 years ago I binged every night to cope and gained 50 pounds. I went from chubby to outright fat. I hate this so much Overeating,Depression
23245,23265,I cannot sleep..idk. nothing to say really. Just feeling empty and hopeless. I wish I could fall asleep with my ex laying on my chest at least one more time. So tired of feeling like shit cannot sleep,Depression
20650,20670,i fucking hate this world. I am a fucking piece of shit freak who cannot do anything except lay in bed and sulk without having a fucking breakdown. i deserve to die. there is nothing more and nothing less to it. its impossible for someone like me to be happy regardless. forever stuck in a body i hate a childhood destroyed by monsters who never gave 2 fucks about me. ill always be socially nightmarish and scare people off. i hate this. december was the plan before but I am increasingly close to just calling it quits early. fuck the plan. I am convinced its impossible to be happy,Depression
18111,18131,I am in my early 20s it is really hard for me to open up with people in real life I prefer to be reticent even if I want to open up sometimes I just cannot. I fear me diving into conversations will mess the fun out of it.Although with the same peeps online it is fun to talk to for long hoursironically they enjoy talking to me sporadically.I just resonate with them and all goes well.But at times I feel lonely it is mostly like once in a month or two. I feel like a wave of sadness washes over me out of nowhere and my heart gets heavy it literally gets and I find breathing a lil difficult. Even though I have people to share my impertinent stuff with I prefer not to share with them as I feel it would end up being boring either for them or for me so I just be sad and lack the vitality to get up and just lay down.I hate to get antidepressants last time I got some by consulting a neuro in 2019 it was hella expensive and was not pleasant at all. I used to be a pretty energetic lad it made me weak and exhausted the whole time. I was hallucinating even during my lectures was naive and stupid to continue that for a month. It was a rough year for me. Things got better for me as of now not a loner anymore. But the sudden feel of loneliness out of nowhere haunts me occasionally for which distractions are hard to find I just lay on the bed watch clock ticking thinking profusely why on earth the clock never stops ticking. Curbing loneliness.,Depression
11224,11244,Hey I am a newer user on Reddit but sadly NOT new to mental health. Amongst my mental health issues are lots of variables at play including comorbidity such as OCD GAD PTSD BiPolar but at the end of the day no matter what treatments I received therapists psychologists psychiatrists the depression became treatment resistant. So far the best years of my life were the last year of high school and all of my twenties. Unfortunately I had to make a bunch of very difficult decisions that all seems to happen at once. my car got totalled with me in it thank you fxcking Nissan Pathfinder trying to turn right from a left lane and took my Mazda along with him. I am not ashamed to mention that I have been raped in the past. Of course there is more but I think that is a good first step.One thing though lately and if you knew me well you would think what the hell happened to her? I am dealing with a lot of. My 30's were by far the WORST. Vancouver is the best metropolis in Canada.Have any of you been able Major Depressive Disorder and Hello! First Post,Depression

17159,17179,Am I a bad person? Am I sound of mind? Do the voices I hear come from a life of trauma? Did that trauma come from within? I often fear I caused my fate that fate came and found me. I did not ask for the pain inflicted on me from the hands of those meant to protect me. I did not ask to hear voices telling me to be afraid of the dark. I have always feared I am a bad person because voices ask me to wrong others. I am not a bad person because I know what is right and wrong. I say no to the dark and face away from the shadows. I refuse to accept that the enemies will stay I wish for the darkness to turn to light. A poem,Depression
47817,47800,tired what is your reaction when people vent or tell their pathetic and sad life to you ?like for example they live in the street or whatever and they ask you what u would do if that was you and youre so weak that youre already laughing at how QUICKLY you wouldve kys in this situation ?? like you dont even do it on purpose but u laugh because your life is objectively so much less tragic but youre kinda like bro I could nevaaaaah bc i feel like this 100 of the time i cant do the easiest thing ? like just go out and study for more than 2 months without encountering situations that just proves me i dont belong in this societyworld ? im so so so tired but theres a fucking thing that just tolds me i dont deserve to die but i mean thats a lie everyone deserves it especially meidk what to do to not suffer and not kms ? i dont like anything anymore ive been thinking the same thing since im 15 i dont have a passion dont have a purpose and im fucking angry with everyoneim actually really jealous of people getting out of depression because thats what shows theyre normal ppl that are getting sad when something v sad happens to them.its not my case i dont like this world and i dont wanna live in it.idk it makes me sick to see ppl wake up everyday to do things i will never ever want to do in my life.???like wtf you obtain by watching sunsets and walking and just wake up everyday ? its boring. theres no purpose wtf im so pissed rn.sometimes i even picture myself in if i would have lived the same way as my parents and I KNOW I WOULD KILL MYSELF INSTANTLY. i dont picture myself to be happy ever.i even have a boyfriend for 3 years now and im even more sad. the only thing that makes my life a little better is drugs music porn alcohol and sex and since i have a boyfriend sex is so boring and even now that we are in a open relationship i dont even have the motivation to see people i used to live for flirting with guys before i really had nothing else that made me feel goodnow idk i just feel like a depressive person going through a depression ?sometimes i cant even get out of bed to roll a joint bc i have no strengthi dropped out of school a lot and i have nothing to offer to this word officially bc unofficially i know im smart i know how to help people i could have made myself useful but 1 ppl dont let me show them bc i have no diplomas or anything to show them my worth 2 even tho ppl want me somewhere i end up burn out int and disappearing bc deep down i dont wanna live this life. PERIODalso i have a very strong sense of value and i find so fucking pathetic the fact that anyone can just THINK theyre smart and could be useful while being actually just a loser all their life. as an example my boyfriend which is even dumber than me is always thinking he can be rich and can enter any school thanks to me he knows he set his expectations too high but he believes he can get rich af without KNOWING A SINGLE NOTION IN FINANCE OR BUSINESS COURSES ??? he doesnt even have a GED equivalent at 22 and their friends and even parents says thinking is not his specialtylike wtf thats why im also so mad at him bc hes disposed to be a loser but unlike me hes happy like a fucking moron ??? idk thats just too much now he wants to go live abroad. AND GUESS WHAT.that stupid moron never ever thought about that in his entire life so he doesnt know any other cultures or languages except our french and he still thinks he can get a job in a country like Singapore Canada Switzerland The US ?????!!!!anyway hes a pure reflection of how much my life is a disaster. mentally he is the opposite of what ive ever wanted and supported ? even politically hes just following the trends he believes what anybody says as long as its in a video.anyway i wanna die but i dont even hate him enough to do that to him.i feel pity for him but im the one whos sad wtf,Depression

47110,47098,my depression keeps getting worse and i want to stop pushing away the people i love. 20MI feel like im slowly decaying. My mind slips i cant remember much anymore i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore at least not the ones that ive done already which is just about everything. I have all the desire in the world to get better but no motivation. I can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. I noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. It feels like a disease.My life just feels like im in limbo every day. I wake up do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. At night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. Its nothing horrifying or disturbing but they really bother me. Its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose.The thought that really bugs me the most the reason for making this post in the first place tells me to push people away. Not really in that exact manner but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. Everyone is normally completely fine but not during my episode. It makes me feel like a completely different person. It makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. Its similar for my friends. Im fine with them normally but during my episodes they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. But after i go to sleep and wake up everything is back to normal. I love my girlfriend and i like my friends. This thought didnt start happening until this month. I never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends and i always hated being alone and i still do which is how i can tell that im getting worse. Im just not me anymore im a completely different person than the one i used to know.The other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future and general sadness questions. Wondering if im ever going to live a stable life or if im going to feel happy and content ever again or if i will continue to be a failure forever. I always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually and i cant feel like this forever but most times its hard to convince myself. I cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. Im not suicidal i dont have a desire to stop living and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. But these episodes make it really difficult to be a living functioning person.I need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. I know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally but im afraid of them.,Depression
37918,37915,i ve been experiencing huge bout of just feeling unmotivated not useful i ve been randomly just tearing up but it never last long i don t feel like i have a reason to cry but i do and i don t know what to do there s other stuff but i don t want to drag on too long i also just miss how thing were i ve woken up like this for the past week and it s persisted throughout the day,Depression
10267,10287,preface is that i do actually suffer from clinical depression and i used to take 150mg zoloft but I have been off that bc i moved and my psychiatrist does not accept how far i moved so I am out of meds. the withdrawal sucked for a few weeks but I am feeling okay now. my problem comes from the fact that i need to get a job. normally it takes me a few months to get over the decision making stage of work or commit suicide and I am over that stage now and decided to work but I am just stuck here now because the closest place is like a 30 minute bike ride? i applied anyways and they have not gotten back to me but I am just concerned because i do not think I am strong enough to just bootstrap my way into both learning to ride and riding 5 days a week in 90 degree weather. i have a few months left to live where i stay unless i get a job and my accounts are all depleted so I am just like okay yeah let us get a job but i rode there once and i had to literally sit and pant for like 15 minutes lol. i do not doubt that its possible bc i see people all the time but it just feels like its dangerously hot for me and everything thinks its just because I am from a colder climate but the temperature out here is enough to put me on my ass easily i just do not have any other way to get money.. and i do not know if I am strong enough to take that trip but even worse is that its been 2 weeks and i have not gotten a call back. if this place does not hire me then I am screwed and ill have to bike even further or die so I am just like fuck what do i do! sorry i just woke up and this is more of a rant but this scenario has been on my mind forever. i considered ubering to work if i get hired but idk i do not know if I am lazy or not,Depression

19698,19718,I have not quite entered into an episode or anything yet but I have got to get this stuff off my chest.Realized over the past 12 hours or so that nearly all my closest friends are not going to be around during my last year of high school. I know I was lucky to have them in the first place but it is really coming down on me that most of them are going to be gone. One got in massive trouble with his parents and is having to move across the state to live with them. One is transferring to a private school on the other side of town. One is opting out to do only remote stuff. Another had to move north for their dad's employment. There were a few that I had to cut out by my own volition because of their behavior sexual harassment narcissism etc.. I am looking at my life right now and realizing that almost every single person that I have gotten close to over the past couple of years is having to leave for some reason it sucks when shit like this dawns on you out of nowhere. All the sudden realizing that things are going to be a huge struggle only weeks before school starts back up. If you are feeling worried about the upcoming school year I guess I just wanted to say that I think most of us are pretty spooked too. Summer sadness solidarity. Friends going away,Depression
22075,22095,Yesterday I decided to go finish my degree after COVID forced me to withdraw. This year has been the hardest year as previous posts will highlight with depressive and suicidal thoughts the highest I have had in my life. For the first time I feel like I am looking up to see a future just a few weeks ago I did not think I had. One step at a time. But I think I saw a smile on my face today. I decided to go back and finish my degree and its the first time I have seen the light in a while,Depression

13243,13263,He said he was falling to a black hole and he would not want to meet me. it is been 4 months since. I kept texting him and he responded at first. I got worried when he said that he has not seen or talked to any friends. I know his sleeping and eating patterns were crappy even before. His family or other friends does not know about the depression. He said he has seeked help but I have not heard how is it going. He said that my messaged did not bother and he did not block me or anything even when I said he could ig it get overwhelming. it is been 2 months since he responded mey messages. Should I give him space or keep texting? I guess the history of dating makes me anxious that he would just cut all contact with me. Should I keep checking on a depressed guy we used to date but we are just friends now who has withdrew from anyone and has not responded my texts for months?,Depression

I talk to therapists but they give up on me because I am not willing to make any change. I take these meds I do not even know if they help anymore. They want to put me in a hospital to try harder meds. I feel like I am a vegetable there is no live left in me everyday is boring numb and the same. I am disgusted in myself but slowly become to accept the fact that I was never meant to have life in the first place. At this point I am just hoping to find the strenght to end myself because I am too weak and lazy to do that as well. I feel like I have already gave up and now I am just a vegetable,Depression
18742,18762,I have been thinking about it for a while and I am going to take a lot of antidepressants causing me to have serotonin syndrome and overdose. To be honest I am really scared but I have to do it. I cannot take it anymore. I cannot keep on pretending like everything is fine and ok. And I am sick and tired of people underestimating my depression even my therapist. All the people I know including my therapist do not believe that I might actually hurt myself. They think that all I do is just whine and complain but will not actually do anything about it. do not get me wrong they do care about me and love it just they do not think that the depression I have is severe. I need to do this. I do not want to live anymore. Also I need to show them that when I say that I cannot take it anymore and I am going to kill myself that I am not just overreacting. I am scared and terrified of what is going to happen but I would rather do it than keep on living for one more day. On Sunday I am going to overdose on Prozac and DULoxetine,Depression
13679,13699,I 20F am currently taking birth control pills but sometimes I have days where the side effects of depression hit me hard and I suffered from depression during my teenage years so I understand how bad it can get for me.One time I remember convincing myself how much I wanted to kill myself and that I do not deserve to be here but the next day I was okay again. I feel I am kind of entering another small episode of the side effect and I do not know how to deal with it as I am losing motivation to do anything.Because of this I feel its impacted my relationship with my 24M bf we have been together for 4 months as I will have days where I would just be on edge and short tempered for no reason which caused a small fight between us. After I explained why I did what I did and it seemed to have gone wellI just want advice on how to better control my emotions as I feel I am becoming more anxious and prone to having a depressive episode than before and I do not want this to impact the relationship negatively and end up with me over thinking on things. I can feel the depression coming back,Depression
8144,8164,did anyone else develop a stutter from being depressed what did you do to help you get out of it? how do you deal with the stutters?,Depression
21509,21529,Basically the title but a little background story for context.So it all probably started in middle school when I was bullied in school and developed severe anxiety social anxiety and just a general feelings of worthlessness and inferiority. Then I went on to high school and I was bullied again so I decided to transfer because I believed it would be different but it was not so I transferred again a year later again thinking it would be different but I was bullied again. But all the transferring caused me to finish high school 2 years later because where I live in Europe if you transfer you have to start as a freshman again. So I graduated 2 years later last year at 21 and started college but I got covid during my exam season and I was sick for 2ish months I could not get out of bed and I was not able to study for any of my exams so I just dropped out. I have been feeling really depressed ever since so I applied to a different college and Ill be starting in fall but Ill be 23 then. It did not really matter to me that much before but now that I have been seeing many people my age graduating lately it kind of hit me that my peers are graduating and Ill only be starting now. It made me feel even more like a failure than before. I keep blaming and hating myself for transferring so many times in high school and for dropping out of college and everything. Why do I keep making all these stupid decisions??!! Now I am going to have to be in class with 18 year olds and Ill feel like the odd weird old one. I am considering not even going and just giving up on everything completely at this point. But I also feel like that might make me feel even more like a failure so idk what is worse. Damn I wish I could just go back in time and never make those stupid life choices. I am starting college at 23 and I feel like a complete failure.,Depression

17342,17362,A few days ago I made a post saying I was going to make an attempt on my life. Luckily it never happened. My exgirlfriend had called my mom telling her I sent a foreboding message to her and I got rushed to the hospital.I got admitted into a psych ward as an inpatient for 23 days. I got prescribed Seroquel at first but that only made me incredibly tired and I am not bipolar as they may have thought and now I am on Wellbutrin 150MG XR until further notice. do not ever hesitate to reach out. People do care even when they seen like they do not. My mom would have never left work to come get me unless she cared.My ex would have never told my mom if she did not care.You are loved and me getting help immediately showed me I am too.Never hesitate to get help. An Update,Depression
48036,48018,Ive gone to multiple psychologists and it feels like a sham. I have had depressive tendencies since an early teen and Ive gone to see a Pyscologist since I was having problems at home and school. They diagnosed me with oppositional defiance disorder. Whatever. Later down my life I am getting myself more situated and doing well in college but I still feel depressed. Go see a Pyscologist while in school I test very high on the beck depression test. Therapist says I should ask a doctor for medicine. I asked a doctor and they said they dont want me on medicine because I can get addicted. Drop the therapist bc talking does nothing as Ive learned over the years this is just how I normally feel. Cut to now and Im still depressed but have no motivation to go see someone bc it feels like its a waste of time and money. Dont even know where to go to find a psychiatrist,Depression
7111,7131,what is the point of studyingworking or having a relationship if i know exactly what the outcome is going to be.Which is not happiness in my case. For some people it is easy to say Be yourself but they also has a list of expectations of my future that even i do not really care about. How is that fair? If you are a parent and you are reading this please do not force your expectations dreams on your children just because you had a miserable life because you had kids. it is not the kids fault to be born in a world surrounded by expectations. I feel like nothing really matters in life anymore,Depression
22029,22049,My husband and I m got married about 2 years ago and were very happy together. We were in fairly dark mental and career states when we met through work but found happiness in each other and have both left that work place. I am now in a successful place in a new career in a new city and I enjoy all of those things work success place family. But my husband just got a new seasonal job at the place we used to both work. And so he lives with some of our best friends in that town which is about a 4 hour drive away. Hes loving every minute new duties new coworkers amazing boss and he loves the place he is. And I am so damn happy for him. It really fills my heart to talk to him on the phone and visit him. To see him so thrilled to be doing what hes doing is such an amazing gift to us both. But that means I have been living alone for about 8 weeks now since he left. He comes to visit every few weekends and I have found that is the only time I have enough energy to even put plates in the empty dishwasher or put wrappers in the trash or empty the overflowing recycling or pick up the dog shit in the yard. Its the only time I can must the strength to vacuum wipe down counters do laundry etc. I do not have many friends in this new city. Most of them are back at our old work where my husband is. I like my coworkers but I am far younger than all of them and do not necessarily see eye to eye on everything. So I spend all my time alone. I have not walked the dog in weeks we just play in the back yard. The house is extremely messy by our standards. Its a depression pit. But hes coming home this week for a few days. And so I am picking up the place because I suddenly have the energy to hide my shameful mess and make the space welcoming for him. The kitchen is clean the yard is picked up the sheets are fresh the trash is empty and it feels so good and clean. Why cannot I just do this for myself? Why cannot I get enough energy to do the little things every night to keep the house like this? Instead when I know I should do these housekeeping chores I get mad at myself for not having the energy to do it which makes me just want to hide from the world. I go crawl into bed and watch crappy YouTube videos instead. How do you get the energy to take care of yourself? I just realized how little I value myself. Ill bend over backwards for everyone else to make them happy but I cannot even gather energy to toss garbage if I am alone.,Depression

11792,11812,Hello! it is a rather long story basically my whole life and how my parents' behavior and little comments affected my decisions in life and make me really really sad.I am 20yo at the moment female but have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 13. I am not diagnosed with depression have not been able to go the psychotherapy because my parents think I am joking and it is over exaggerated. Back in 2014 when I was hitting puberty I had an awful summer where I realized everything is meaningless and whatever I do in my life is going to be forgotten and had my nihilistic phase crying all day that I am useless I have no friends no one to understand me nothing. It was rather unusual because my mom has given me love all my life my father was a bit on the cold side as he stopped expressing love towards me once i started growing up and decided to raise me up as a boy and not spoil me. All in all my 2014 summer was pretty sad I told my mom about it and that I wanted to see a psychiatrist because I did not feel too well but she brushed it off with If you go to the psychiatrist at 13 you are going to become insane at 30 its a stigma in my country to seek help from a professional about your mental health. During the years after that i grew out of this nihilistic phase decided that even though everything is meaningless you can still enjoy the good things in life. I still had my episodes of wanting to kill myself end it all being unbothrred with everything crying over boys broken hearted and many more occasions. Overall I still had that it is whatever if I live or die today and it was getting stronger when i was struggling with love when it was raining when my parents put me down for not being the first in mathsphysics competitions had different POV from their wanted to go out with my friends as much as they could enjoy life they are basically super strict and did not allow me lots of things even when i begged. I was also not allowed to have any boyfriends till 21 no joke here.Ff to 2020 I finally decide to begin a serious relationship with this guy even keep it in a secret and love him and enjoy life. I am also studying abroad in the Netherlands first year student so we keep it long distance. it is 2 months into the uni year and i become super homesick for my family and my bf i am crying all the time i am also struggling with uni and just cannot stand it anymore to which coronavirus gets out of control and they let us go online so i get back to my country. My parents are happy I am happy but i am worried how i should tell yhem about my bf and my struggles with uni. They are pretty chill because I have lots of time till the end of the uni year so even if i struggle i can get better. Ff May 2021 my parents become super toxic telling me how i should study spend this amount of time to this course and doing this and that to which i reply that i will not follow their advice because things are much different than they were 30years ago. They become super oppressive and i decide to run away and leave them a letter in which i say what i feel that i have a bf and all the things i cannot do. I do so and my mother just stops talking to me so i phone my father and he tells me to come back sit down and talk with them. I do so we have a talk with my father and he is pretty chill about the situation they let me see my bf and travel to his town with one thing in mind that i shall keep studying. I have no problem with that and ff 2 months they are back on their old shit telling me that if i do not pass my exams i can never see him that I am not trying as hard as i can that ill end up as a 711 worker that all I am interested in now is only sex and much more things I will not write down. I scream out loud during one fight that I am fed up with all that disrespect and behavior and burst into tears and start shaking they try comforting me but i doubt that they really understand what is going on in my mind.Today i had an argument with my mother and in the middle of it when neither me nor her was talking she just commented or you are going to tell us that you are going to kill yourself again like it was a fucking joke and i do not feel that way. I am just done with this shit i am so close to harming myself i cannot stand this anymore its been every 23 days its like they just cannot understand me and just want to obey everything they say. i do not even know if it is just me and my head is exaggarating these situations or they really are causing me mental health problems I am just tired of crying myself to sleep and trying to do my best while it still being not appreciated. Are my parents being the problem,Depression

I found a medicine regiment that has been working for me finally but the past 34 days I am having bad depressionlike the lowest of lows that came out of no where. I do not have any energy to do anything. I cannot enjoy things and if I do it is just for a few mins and its gonesometimes feeling worse after. I know that you have to get out more and do things you enjoy to start to come out of it but what do you do when you physically cannot even get the energy to make yourself a tad bit better. it is pretty much crippling at the moment and I hate it. I am not sure how to get out of this slump,Depression
10145,10165,Having your brain work against you is probably up there with some of the most difficult things to comprehend. There are so many instances in life where it decides that this is it this is life now. Wishing things could be different or that you could have done something or helped someone only seems to worsen the fact that it will not get better. Because it will. It will get better. We face difficulties that we think other people do not understand. They do. And they want to help. Life is strange and sometimes seems impossible. But you can win. You can feel better. Life is strange,Depression

Like how seeing a corpse even with no blood or anything can trigger a sickening feeling in your gut. Some days life literally makes me sick. I know the truth. That none of this matters and even if it did i still would not care. In the end life is what i make it or unmake it. I am trying to hold on only because other's say so. But after awhile other's will not matter. A resolution will. The very air of life is beginning to make me sick almost literally.,Depression

I am 20 now and I just do not feel like my life will ever be happy again like it was before I was diagnosed with depression or at least not happy in the same way. I would say my life is extremely mediocre and boring. I just do not know if it will ever be anything more. I want excitement and true happiness and it looks like its not happening. My mental illness ruined my teens years. I feel like I can never get that time back I literally cannot and it seems impossible to make new friends at my age. I cannot see my life ever being good.,Depression

Then there is me stuck where i am average job mortgage on house i have a girlfriend but in 14 years I have never felt secure like she is the one. I cannot ever break up with her because there is always something.We was about to go counselling then she ended up in hospital and three years later doctors are still working on her while she is significantly disabled. Its literally always the worst time. The house is mine so she would end up moving out and trying to start life fresh. I just feel everything is dead ends right now.

12963,12983,I am 19. I usually do not tell my life stories on here bc I know no one will care.But growing up I basically lived in fear of either getting whooped or getting yelled at for not getting perfect grades in school. My dad would only be happy with me if I came back home with good grades. Otherwise he basically disliked me and told me to work harder. This turned me into a perfectionist who absolutely cannot stand criticism. It does not matter if 1000 people like what I am doing. If one dislikes it it takes a massive toll on my confidence because it was not a perfect turnoutI have anxiety. I dislike talking. I feel I am doing everything wrong. My friends do not support me. I have no confidence. Idk what I am doingTheres too much stress on my mind and I never like talking about it to people bc I know they will not care. Crying is for women is what my mom said to me when my dad was yelling at me and I started crying. Three years have passed since she said that and I have not cried since even after my dad passed recently. I hate talking about these things to people but I decided to share this to you guys only since no one knows me on here I hold all of my stresses in which places me into mania. I do not want to talk about them to other people in person bc I do not want to get my feelings invalidated for the 100th time in a rowMy confidence is non existent and today is one of my lowest days. I always worry in the future if I will ever get a job because I am stuck on which major I should pursue in collegeIve watched millions of videos on how to get my confidence up and zero have worked. I try really hard. I want to die How will I ever get my confidence up,Depression

48223,48203,Im a depressed mother who is debating on leaving her family. To make this short and to the point. Ive had depressionanxiety my whole life. Its nothing new other than with age it seems to just get worse. Ive been through the system for help and here I am again. I have a 15 month old who would be better off without her depressed mother around. My whole family is effected by my moods. Its not fair to anyone and I definitely dont want to be the reason everyone is walking on eggshells. I grew up like that and its not fun and look at meI have problems. I believe its better for me to disappear than subject my family to this terrible illness. Ive read how having a depressed mother can effect a child. I also know first thing. I stress my husband out like no other. It can all be solved if I just leave. My husband asks where to? I dont know I have no one so probably the streets. Obviously hes not ok with it but again better than subjecting everyone to this bs. It seems like a fair trade for a better life for them and Im put out of my misery. Its already hard enough to live with this crap to add more guilt and shame it just doesnt make sense.,Depression

10476,10496,I am 16 and this happened when i was 13. this girl invited me over to her house and we had already had sex several times before. i think she said to me that she did not feel like having sex but in my mind i saw it as an opportunity for sex because i was an asshole. when i came over to her house I layed on her bed and we began cuddling. i asked her hey want to have sex about 3 times in the span of an hour so i was being persistent. i was not using force or threats or anything. after the 3rd time she rejected me i then said to her I will go slow and she then responded with alright sure. i was not sure if she was bothered or not I am not sure. she then layed down and i then went inside of her and it felt good so i started to go faster and faster and she sounded like she was enjoying it. why was i starting to go faster? I am not sure honestly but my intent definitely was not bad I did not want to harm her. i guess i just started to go faster because of how good it felt and i was really horny. well anyways 15 seconds after the sex started she told me to stop and i did right away. as soon as i heard her say it i stopped it. she then said that she was sorry for ending it early and she said she was just worried about getting pregnant and I told her its fine. we then hung out for like 20 minutes and then i left. i feel like i will always be a bad person no matter what. i really wish i never met this girl so i would not of done what i did. a year after she told me that she had sex with 9 other guys and that those guys dicks were bigger than mine am i a rapist,Depression

17685,17705,Some people just want to progress but rn I just want to be holding the person I loved and still love so dearly. All I want is to feel that feeling again and it just feels grey without her. Please take me back,Depression
14439,14459,Life sucks.There is nothing interesting or exciting anymore. I used to have hobbies that I enjoyed but nowadays it just feels like I am carrying out tasks and feeling numb. I have things to do but I have zero interest to do them so I constantly procrastinate. I wish I could just stay in bed all day and do nothing even though I hate it too. Social life sucks. I have one real friend who lives far away so we do not see that often. I have my parents who live far away too. Apart from that I just have friends who use me. They call me only if they need something and they talk to me like they care but act differently. I have tried to socialize and get to know other people unsuccessfully. I try be kind to everyone and I do not judge people. I hate the way I look and I keep thinking that is the reason why I do not have friends. There are more people in my life but they are not friends they are just people who I know. If I diseappeared right now my parents would be the only people who would notice that. I do not talk about my feelings to anyone because it would drive them away and I do not want to be a burden. Life sucks and if I could just stop existing if would be great. I do not want to kill myself. Sorry if you read this. This sucks too I do not like living,Depression
15143,15163,I love to collect cute notebooks but never knows what to do with it I tried Bullet Journaling but cannot stick to it. I am trying to occup myself with nice things but depression makes it difficult. I am also not very creative I would like to be but I am bad at drawing writing and many other things... Still I would like to find fun uses of notebooks and get out of my head a little. Any ideas ? Idea of uses for a notebook ?,Depression
14603,14623,Hi everyone I am new to this subreddit. I am simply here to share something with all of you and to maybe gain a little bit of insight. My whole life I have felt like a burden. I have always been the outcast growing up. All the other kids would pick on me in school. I have always felt left out. I feel like I missed out on a lot of things in life because of it. I want to transition into manifestation. I feel like i simply manifest negative energy. I think negatively quite often and I feel like it affects me in a very bad way. Sometimes I find myself trying to think positively but at the end of the day I am just a negative person in general. Sometimes I feel like my own family does not like me even though they most likely do. I feel like there is more for me to say but as of right now I am not sure what to talk about anymore. Thank you for reading. Feeling Like a Burden,Depression
8711,8731,Is anybody else here plagued by constant stress related intrusive thoughts? They come from nowhere and always involuntarily. They seem to be related to stress since higher levels of stress make them worse for me. For me most of the times it is a fantasy i get stuck into. There are arguments with other people in my head feelings of anger and the stress that it produces. I could be going about doing my thing at home or at work and they will pop up from nowhere. The only time they seem to not be able to appear is when I am talking to someone.Does anyone else experience this? If so any tips for managing it?ampx200BFor those who do not know this is the wikiedia definition of intrusive thoughts''An intrusive thought is an unwelcome involuntary thought image or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession is upsetting or distressing and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate.'' Intrusive thoughts anyone?,Depression
24356,24376,today i was left home with just my mom and she took the opportunity to confront me and tell me she thinks i might be depressed and that the rest of my family feels the same way. for some reason I am frustrated though? one would think it would be a relief because it means i can get help but instead all i feel is angry. does anyone know why this might be? and how can i actually open up and talk about it because all i did was deny that i have it during the conversation. idk... my mom confronted me,Depression
12709,12729,Throwaway for reasons that will become apparent.For some basic info about me I 19M have been diagnosed with MDD a little over 2 years ago after a suicide attempt. I am currently on lexapro and attending regular biweekly therapy sessions. Currently scheduled screening for ADHD as well.Recently I have not been feeling much of anything. I was not sure if it was the meds I hear SSRIs and SNRIs have a high chance of causing numbness. But I am having doubts about that.Prior to about 6 months ago I would regularly and deliberately inflict harm on the dog we have at our home was my grandma's dog bequeathed to my mom after my grandma passed. Methods of abuse include forcefully dragging punching dropping heavy objects on it and throwing it. The dog has since been rehomed and both my mom and therapist are aware of the problem. I did not feel any remorse for harming the dog but felt some anxiety of being caught. I have not been diagnosed with ASD any cluster B personality disorder or conduct disorder.I do not tend to feel empathetic towards people. In fact emotional people tend to annoy me. I have contemplated ASPD and CD being two possibilities for diagnoses but my therapist disagrees with both. This emotional numbness and difficulty empathizing interferes with my depression occasionally. It makes me think that I will live life forever as a robot and that I could possibly be physically incapable of connecting with other people and simply live through life as an unemotional ostracized she will of a person. I would like to feel something and I would like to connect with other people. My therapist sees this as a good sign and stated that most sociopaths or psychopaths do not care about this.I am paranoid that the reason for my emotional numbness is more ingrained and innate rather than being an issue caused by environmental factors. Rambling about what is on my mind,Depression
11113,11133,I do not want anyone to care about me I do not want to do anything with my life I do not want to do anything. I just want to sit with my cat eat and rot on my couch or bed. I hate it when people ask me how I am I hate showering I hate doing anything that is not eating gaming or watching tv. I hate going outside I hate talking to people. I am autistic too making socializing and understanding people even MORE difficult. I fucking hate it when I hear people saying that being autistic or depressed is a gift. NO IT is not. if I could be anything I would be ducking neurotypical. I literally cannot understand people and makes life SO HARD. All my friends end up leaving me too and making friends is even harder than keeping friends. I physically cannot talk about anything that does not interest me. I do not want help I just want to be left alone. Just want to be left alone,Depression
24276,24296,My minds too scrambled to even explain what I am feeling. I just wanted someone to hear what I am thinking. Maybe they feel this way too. Sincerely Depressed mom with everything. I feel so selfish like I do not deserve to be happy or depressed. I do not know where I belong anymore.,Depression
8714,8734,Throwaway because yeah.So I moved in with my partner around 7 months ago. He has both a cat and a dog who are lovely animals and I generally do not have any issues with them. But recently his dog has started pooping and being sick in the house on an almost daily basis normally overnight. it is not health related or anything but just because she is an older dog. She gets her walks and let out for frequent toilet breaks. Now I am the one who gets up first every morning so I have to deal with the mess and I will be honest it is really fucking with my head.I do not wake up great to begin with due to my fucking awful mental health but this can send me into this feeling of white hot rage. I generally keep the anger to myself and smoke a cigarette but sometimes it can lead to an argument. it is making me not want to leave my bed in the morning and I have worked really hard to be able to do that on the best of days. I do not really know how to deal with this and it probably just sounds really petty and stupid but I needed to vent so thanks for reading regardless. Mental health and pets.,Depression

22739,22759,I was told to find my ultimate aim of life. I have not been able to do it but I wonder what others ultimate aim of life is. What is your ultimate aim of life?,Depression
48088,48070,Hope is just a form of selfharm I used to get through my life by believing in the delusion that things were all going to work out one day and Id find my place in the world. Now I realize that all Ive accomplished through this is to prolong my suffering. Every day of my life is pain and misery and nothing else and it will always be that way. I cannot fucking believe that this is what life is but I guess I just got unlucky. Some people get to have loving parents close friends romantic partners and a career they enjoy that makes them enough money to live on. And some of us get none of those things. We get left to rot in shitty minimumwage jobs ignored by all the girls or boys in school treated like shit by everyone who was supposed to care about us. We get nothing and yet were expected to be grateful for a life empty of everything that makes it worth living. So I think Im done with all of this nonsense. I havent planned my way out yet but I think this is where my story is going to end. I cant imagine a future where Im happy and I wont bother trying anymore.,Depression
48259,48239,is it possible that on some days you feel way more tired then the other day even if you feel like your sleep was the same as those other days? one of the main symptoms of clinical depression is feeling tired but is it possible that on some days you feel way more tired then the other day even if you feel like your sleep was the same as those other days?,Depression
23021,23041,I am 20 soon to be 21 and I just cannot handle life. I have been sleeping a lot lately. I go to bed at around 10 pm wake up at 8 am and then go back to sleep at around 11 am or 12 pm. I then sleep until about 3 to 4 pm and then the cycle continues. I have barely any money left and I am relying on selling some of my belongings in order to get money for my phone bills and food. I quit my last job due to the fact that I just did not have it in me to continue working in that environment in an environment in which I felt like I was treated lower than everyone else working there. They did say that I was a good fit for the job but I have a feeling they were lying or they did not talk to the manager that oversaw my tasks at work who I am pretty sure thought I was an idiot.. I am starting to believe him. At one point it was functioning depression but its not anymore. I eat poorly because of my depression I eat way too much food especially bad food. I went into town yesterday to get my meds which only took about 2 hours. I came back and I was exhausted. It makes me think how I was even able to keep a job in the first place if I cannot even go into town to get meds without being tired and fed up with life. The meds in question are antipsychotics and anti depressants since I hear voices and have delusions from time to time and have depression. Besides that I have a hard time being a responsible adult. I put things off either because I am too scared of the outcome or I just do not care enough to do it. I have been taking my meds on time and they helped for a while but they do not help anymore. I just do not have the energy or the care to keep going with this life anymore. Sad part is is that my life is not even that hard. I cannot handle life,Depression
18723,18743,I spend most of my time with family. I love them but I do not like hanging out with family members all of the time. It gets draining especially with some of the toxic family dynamics going on. All of my other friends either no longer live in my city or they have their own tight work schedules.I have tried clubbing at least three different times. I did not like it. I cannot force myself to have fun at clubs so I have acknowledged that I just do not like clubbing and there is nothing wrong with that. I have also tried online dating but I do not like that either. So I gave up on using OLD apps and sites. they are too frustrating.I go on solo adventures in my city but it gets lonely at times. I just wish I had someone to hang out with. I do not care about their gender just as long as its someone outside of my family. I wish I had someone to hang out with,Depression
22995,23015,I wish there was a way I could just start my life over again before I destroyed my body with my eating disorder and made so many mistakes. I have spent the past 2 days fantasizing about something impossible,Depression
20606,20626,I have been experiencing some really bad depression for a while now but I try not to bring it up to people because I know people do not care and do not want to hear about my boring problems. I just thought that this would be the most appropriate place to let my feelings out when I have no one. I stay in my room every day for most of the day not talking to anyone except for my dad who I live with from time to time. I cannot find the motivation to do even the smallest of tasks such as brushing my teeth which I have not done for around a week. I just do not know. Sorry for this post and I know it probably will not be seen by many people but as long as one person interacts with it at some point then Id be so grateful. Going through it all on my own,Depression
40223,40220,well i have so much going on in my brain let me try to organize it having an existential crisis i m i ve done nothing with my life i m scared to death that a sizable chunk of my life is gone for nothing i work at fast food where there is no advancement whatsoever i just want to go back to school but i can t tired of my job like i said i work fast food i worked a a crew leader and the b i went through on a daily basis wa enough to have me walk out a year and a half of day a week of bull crap just piled up on top of me one and a half year of them playing music i can t stand and me being too nice to say anything because i didn t want to be the one to ruin it for everyone else so i endured with one ear bud in my ear until my bos told me no ear bud back to square one listening to others music for hour a day tired of life ever since 0 hell ever since i got out of the army my life ha been shit in the army i wa confident strong and proud my co took everything from me and gave me the boot ever since 009 my life ha been a struggle to get settled on two foot i ve abused drug been raped been abused been through natural disaster that have taken everything from me i have been kicked to my butt then kicked again while i wa down i hate being disabled i m ptsd ocd bipolar adhd i take so many medication that i don t know what to do with myself just to have a somewhat normal life i m so tired of getting my emotion dismissed and told that i m overreacting just because my disability isn t seen,Depression
13312,13332,I am scared. I just need someone to explain what happens. What do they do? How do parents handle it? How are the antidepressants? Once you are diagnosed can you really recover? What questions do they ask....if its major what then? Will I be treated differently? Is it better undiagnosed? I do not like psychologists. I do not want to have sessions. I know I need help and I am probably far into the rut but I do not know what To do. What are the stages or what is the procedure of being diagnosed with depression?,Depression
15401,15421,Its like I am really aware that my heart is beating. But like it hurts where my heart is and every time my heart beats it hurts a little bit more. It comes in waves like my heart beats. Its like anxiety.. like what you feel when you fall up the stairs in that split second and your entire body kind of drops for a second. It feels like that in my heart with the waves and heart beats constantly. Its like anxiety and sadness mixed. I hate it so much. I am going to try my best to explain the pain I am feel right now.,Depression
24985,25005,I am always in a bad mood and I have to mentally restrain myself from snapping at people. Life just sucks is there anything that makes life redeeming?

My life is not working in my favor.Everything just makes me so mad even the things that are not even annoying. I am just so angry all the time,Depression

Recently however she's been bringing her friend around a lot me my sister and her husband all get along really well so we hang out at least 2 or 3 weekends a month usually and as I get to know this girl I am realizing why my sister has been so adamant about it.

29703,29723,Long story but a few years ago my wife of fifteen years who had never been with anyone else opened up and told me she fantasized a lot about being with other men and considered herself somewhat polyamorous. I was upset and it took a couple of years of us discussing this before I started to feel more comfortable with things. We eventually started swinging only about once every couple of months and always same room as it seemed like a way for us to explore this part of her together and it ended up being a lot of fun and something I really enjoyed that brought us closer together. Well its been a couple of years and Ive felt happy and comfortable with where we are at but I decided to ask my wife the other day and she said she was happy but she also had a desire to date people separately and would be willing to try it if I was. This was really hard for me to hear.,Normal

29592,29612,One of the couples I know is made up of cancer survivors the male had cancer as a child thankfully beat it but developed PTSD from the experience the female has had 2 different battles with cancer brain and breast beat them both but suffers from significant developmental issues including cognitive delay and balance issues. They represent polar opposites on the spectrum of how cancer survivors can view the world one feeling positive about having survived so much the other being angry with the world that it happened in the first place. That's neither here nor there. I'll stop for a moment to explain that I'm not one of those that feels PTSD isn't a real condition. I grew up in an abusive home for years and it wasn't until my mid 20's that I began come to terms with how subtly that had affected me over the years.,Normal

27959,27979,I know this will prob get doe vote to oblivion but every time i see this phrase it just feels so negative. Anxiety can be cured you can feel normal again and you could even say that managing it is a cure anyway. People without anxiety manage fear and anxiety on a day to day basis it's just it comes naturally to them without even noticing that's the point we need to get ourselves back to in order to be cured. I'm guessing I'm not the only one that feels demotivated when they see this phrase so maybe use it less on here guys?,Normal

29783,29803,i have asked for her patient while he gets trained but i understand her not wanting to potentially move into an environment that disturbers her normal way of life but thats 6 months from now. I am confident that training would fix 70 of the issues that she has with my dog. Could there be something else deeply underlying that i am missing? To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER . If she has trouble with compromising on a proper solution now what will happen when it comes to or much larger life decisions like buying a house or moving to a new city.,Normal

My doctor disagrees with their assessment and local social workers are helping me with my appeal.

If anyone would be willing to contribute to my bills while I am under appeal it would be greatly appreciated.,Normal

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate you will be asked to provide some demographicbackground information respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time and about your quality of life.

50999,51199,Therapy Success for AVPD? Anyone? Ive only recently discovered my disorder falls into AVPD 6 of 7 characteristics. Ive been going to a psychiatrist for years whos treated me for depression Zoloft. Ive always been shy overly self critical etc. Ive been to 5 Therapists over the last 20 years none have really helped me. Weve identified the causes of my AVPD very critical parents physical abuse. . Sexual abuse in Jr High. However thats a far as I get. The rest is just talking about my feelings. I get 6 to 9 mos in and I feel like Im just saying the same stuff. So I quit. Has any AVPDsufferers ever had success with Therapy? What does success look like? I cant even imagine. Are you more socially successful and bulletproof from criticism? What methods did you use in Therapy that made you successful? What did you do beyond talking about your traumas that helped you?What kind of Therapist was helpful in getting passed or improving? Is there some specialization or kind of therapist that is more successful with AVPD? Thx.,Personality-disorder

50980,51179,why do I feel like I scare people? So i am currently in college for nursing I've been practically a hermit of a stay at home mom since 2016. I thought maybe I could get past my anxious feelings of making friends in once I got to school but it's turning into the same thing all over again. I have in person class 2 days a week and I met a girl who was open about her mental health. We clicked and I thought great I can do this I can make a friend. We even exchanged numbers which is HUGE for me. We texted a little but then in class she went from sitting next to me to jokingly saying I'd rather be next to insert classmates name. Now I have tried to be chill with this other classmate too. We had a similar dark sense of humor but then the past two classes I felt like a third wheel. Like the first girl just started to distance and almost mean yet she asks me to study with her and the other. I am.so confused and also feel like they are pitying me. Like I just wanted to flee the class and sob because i felt like once again people automatically shut me out bc of my quirks. Idk if this is an AVPD thing or an autistic thing. I just feel defeated and alone. I so desperately want a friend.,Personality-disorder

It just is how it is. What Ill try to work onIll allow myself to fail stutter or mumble when I dont feel comfortable talking in groups but Ill talk nonetheless when I have something to say so that I can practice that which Im not good at.Which means Ill allow myself to feel discomfort. Deep discomfort and shame which I know will lessen one day or Ill get used to the feelings. Ill allow myself to be intimate with people I feel comfortable with. And to warn them when I feel like fleeing and hiding. The right people will understand and wont give up so easily. Ill accept failure expect disappointment and revel in misery because I know it will lead me to something better than this dark void Ive been living in the last years of my life. Thank you.,Personality-disorder

Could be when my mental health went downhill or when I got off my meds or when I got high almost every day for a year. But nowadays its not uncommon for me to struggle to write simple sentences. Sending an email or text takes me way longer than it should.It really interferes when Im trying to talk with others. So often I feel like I know what I want to say but the words are just out of reach and instead of adding to the conversation Im just like yeah.. uuuh I feel you,Personality-disorder

But never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way. Its probably the only time I spoke with a girl. Mainly because I was invested in wanting to be with he but was to afraid to be with her in a relationship.If AvPD is not only avoiding woman for my instance then I dont understand AvPD.,Personality-disorder

The folk who just don't thrive on attention and competition. I absolutely believe we were born this way.I've tried and failed to describe this to so many psychiatrists and psychologists it's not even funny anymore. The schizoids call this anhedonia. Myself I've always struggled to orgasm during sex. We are OK. We're not psychopaths. We have empathy and we have all the things in place in order to love.,Personality-disorder
51468,51732,Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I selfdiagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic paranoid insecure and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my trauma is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did but they felt really sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself and nobody did for me.This person lashed out at me calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and honestly that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.This person wasn't wrong but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back it felt nasty and unwarranted.Still though it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends a few years since those bad exchanges occured and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my selfesteem and it still does.When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like I wanna die to myself like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more normal again though.Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered offtopic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.,Personality-disorder
51421,51681,Anyone else terrified of dying alone? finally found the will to post here after years of lurkingIve been living alone for all my adult years and I work from home. I dont have any kind of social life and can easily spend several weeks without seeing or speaking to anyone. I do have family but they all live far away and I dont see them often.So sometimes I cant help but wonder what would happen if I ever have a stroke or a heart attack or if I fall down the stairs or if I choke on some food I often read about people being found dead in their home several years or even decades after they died and deep down Im convinced thats how Ill end up. It really makes me feel scared and helpless and I dont know how to cope with it.,Personality-disorder
51162,51388,Im pretty sure no one even likes me cant cope My whole life everyone has been at best indifferent to me amp often times just outright abusive to me. The depths to which I feel alone cant even be put into words this isnt a new thing its always been this way but its really starting to hit me that Im living for people who dont care to do a damn thing to help me amp maybe theres just something deeply wrong with me for no one to ever care about me at all. I truly dont think I can keep going with no hope of ever having any connection with anyone amp I dont know what to do. Its not like I even have anything to live for for me. My life is completely empty the only people I have around me demand so much of me ampor hurt me. I dont think Im even capable of building a better life amp if I am then I dont know if Im capable of making it for that long with absolutely no help from anyone. My whole life feels like such a waste Ive never had any purpose.,Personality-disorder
50565,50726,Appearance and AvPD It seems superficial almost but my severe acne is contributing a lot to my avoidant tendencies right now. I'm doing everything in my power to treat it dermatologist prescription acne cream antibiotics clean bedding clean diet daily showers face wash etc. It just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst I've seen. I'm talking big red cysts. At this point I'm convinced my lithium is causing it.I was making decent progress too. I was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. I'm trying to work up to going back to work. But I just can't bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this. If I go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how I look and feeling gross I feel as though I'm doomed to fail. If my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then I pretty much have to bail. I'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. I don't know what to do it just feels hopeless. Between severe cystic acne and hyperhidrosis it is so fucking difficult to put myself into social situations. It's much safer to just hide away and wait it out but each day that passes is another day I've lost.,Personality-disorder
51029,51236,Can't get anything done Not sure if anyone else relates but I'm struggling to start or finish anything. I'm incredibly behind in my work and I don't do any hobbies or spend much time at the gym either. I'm also pretty ashamed of myself which leads me to avoid people. It's not a good circle to be stuck in. I've had ideas for things to try but it's pretty hard to start anything. Does anyone else relate?,Personality-disorder
50693,50868,Anyone else fantasize about being a part of a community but ghost it when given the opportunity? I can't count how many times I've begun to integrate into a new social setting only to ghost it all without a word because of the anxiety of unspoken social expectations.,Personality-disorder
50907,51099,do you feel the need to stop doing something you enjoy once others find out you do it? Or when you become a regular at a new place and other regulars start remembering you and you're no longer '' new''?Me too. I did not know it was an AvPD thing before finding this sub. The worst part is i want to socialise and i want to not care what others think of what i e' joy. But i care. It feels like once others find out that i'm a real person they start to expect me to behave like whoever they perceive me to be. And that puts pressure on me and it makes me want to run away.,Personality-disorder
51227,51455,Communication When you have avpd you avoid forming relationships ight?Therefore most of us prefer living like hermits. The point I am trying to make is is there anyone else who notice that they can't carry even simplest chit chats?When someone tries to talk to me and asks anything I try my best to come up with an answer but it feels like there is some sort of static in my head the white noise. I guess it's because I heavily prefer my fantasies over real life ,Personality-disorder
51169,51395,I don't know why I'm so selfdefeating. I can't help it. I don't avoid people because I'm anxious or embarrassed or ugly or feel unwanted. People try to make connections with me and I shut them down or ghost them. I just refuse the effort. And it's not because it's unwantedI wish I had friends I want to date I imagine what my life would be like if I wasn't me and it looks like a lot of fun. I don't think I'm actually schizoid or anything. I just don't have the drive to improve my life in the ways I know I should.I have never been in a relationship but I have accounts on a couple different dating apps. I put effort into my profiles and then I ignore every message I get. When people try to talk to me in public I usually just walk away. I don't know why. Engaging at all just doesn't seem possible. It feels like writer's block only it's going to ruin my life.It's not like I had a traumatic childhood or anything. I wasn't abused. My parents weren't narcissists. I wasn't even particularly unpopular in school but even back then even in elementary school I would refuse any efforts to hang out outside the classroom. I would never go over to my friend's houses even though my mom always said yes. Most often I wouldn't even tell her I was invited. And then I would feel sad from the isolation lol.I don't really know what the point of this post is. It's more of a rambling vent than anything else. I need to get it off my chest somehow. My family is so confused by my behavior but I can't bring myself to talk to them about it. Somehow it's easier on an anonymous subreddit. I'm not even sure if this is allowed here since I'm not officially diagnosed. When I was 19 I went to a psychiatrist to get treatment for my OCD. I didn't want to but the only other option was killing myself which I wanted to do less. He's the one who brought AvPD to my attention but he didn't give me a diagnosis that day. He wanted me to come back for follow up appointments to narrow things down. I refused. I don't know why.,Personality-disorder

51302,51541,Idk but now Im moving to a place I never been to. I lived in a place with very expensive rent. I tried living with my family but basically over the last two days everything fell apart. Some of it is technically my fault but more AvPD. I tried living in supported housing but always had a roommate who wouldnt let me sleep. Almost got into having my own room but it fell apart before that. This is pretty much crazy but hopefully it will work out. Im on disability so Im trying to live somewhere I can get a cheap apartment. Its possible I can get a job to make the budget issues easier. For living in unhealthy situations I couldnt hold down a job. Im at least hoping thats the reason. Things with my family were ok before but after Covid there was like an explosion of bad luck going around. Somehow I was used as a scapegoat. Basically scared but also my life was going in a vicious cycle. I had to change something major.,Personality-disorder

Could that be considered a symptom? lolNow seriously I've never even spoken about this out loud with anyone and I'm freaking out right now. Will I be able to go get tested? It's so silly but I'm afraid I will only have regular anxiety and I'll be embarrassed about making a whole deal about it.Anyway I'll put on some relaxing music and open it... at some pointEDIT so they're sending me a phone number to get in touch with them. Like seriously a voice call?? I CANNOT.EDIT 2 It just occurred to me what if it's a test already? I doubt it but I'm really surprised they asked a possible AVPD person to make a phone call.EDIT 3 I just texted this woman and told her If you don't mind it's more comfortable for me to speak this way. Then she texted me back I'm on the subway now I'll call you asap. facepalm I really need help but I'm starting to regret it right now.EDIT 4 More than a day later they called me and I didn't pick it up. I am bothered by the fact that they should be more sensitive considering they're specialised in these kinds of disorders. Immediately afterwards they texted me and I thought they would have realised and would communicate by text. But the text said You have a missed call from me. Tell me when you're available. sigh I think I'll try to tell my current therapist after all because it gives me less anxiety than changing.,Personality-disorder

51374,51622,Get angry because of noisy people do you guys feel that? My cousins 1416y often come to my house they are pretty noisy at night and i like to go to bed early so it bothers me. I tell them to be quiet but soon they are making a lot of noise again. Sometimes i went up to them and scold them sometimes even calling them names such was the anger. My mother says that I am not very understanding and very hard on them. I feel like I got a little bit of the avoidant trait from her personality.I'm not diagnosed with AvPD but i'm pretty sure that i have it. Idk if this reactive response to noise could be a CPTSD thing. In summary i wanna now if this is a AvPD response. Anyone relate?

51315,51556,Intense fear of failure Today I found out that 'atychiphobia' is the clinical term for the fear of failure. I've been consumed by atychiphobia ever since my teenage years. I've purposely passed up on big opportunities due to it and as a result held myself back multiple times.Well now I've stumbled upon a hurdle that I need to overcome in order to achieve my next goal in life. I've been looking for ways to bypass the hurdle so I don't have to potentially experience failure but I can't seem to find any other ways forward. The reality is I'll have to attempt to overcome this obstacle in order to move forward but it's terrifying knowing I might never overcome it.Anyone ever experienced similar or have tips for overcoming this fear?,Personality-disorder
50988,51187,Thought I'm getting better I'm single approaching 30s have a stable job and stable family. Getting more skilled at my job recently really helped boost my confidence and I'm used to being a nonvoluntary lone ranger. I thought nothing could hurt me anymore.Yet today something simple triggered me. Someone I joined the company with got married yet I was not invited but few others were. This is not the first time this has happened. I can count on one hand how many times someone invited me and not as a second thought. Also the embarrassment when I only learned someone's wedding is coming when having a random group lunch and learning I was not invited yet trying to sidestep other's question if I'm coming. I always think they have a separate group chat with majority of them and always wondering why I'm not included. Maybe I'm too boring and not prettyfashionable like them.I've long come to terms with the fact that people are just not interested in me since I was a teenager. Always not being invited being left out of information or plain rejected to my face. I never have a romantic relationship and no guys ever show interest in me. All the vague 'friends' term I use whenever I talk to my mother to hide the fact that her daughter was all alone ever since she entered university.It just hurts so bad and reminds me so much of my teenage years. One day I wish I'll have a partner who always puts me first in his thoughts. Thanks for reading my rant.,Personality-disorder

51569,51843,I despise my mom 22m Pretty much the title I just can't stand her I never liked her ever since I was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it.Just to clarify I don't think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if it's just the order of the way I put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are MY things she isn't satisfied with the way I put my clothes in my wardrobe or when I don't do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy In the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open even this days she complain when I don't leave a gap but on that case I don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kidspeople' because I don't act or do things they do and I cant forget her 'what you gonna do with your life play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason.Im afraid of embarrassing myself in public im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because I don't think I can do it or I'll make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how I was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons I eat in my room is because I just don't want to be around her because I will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it and my dad lives abroad my ears my hair my clothes everything. She always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever I want regardless of her opinionpicks I still remember that when I was younger she would be upset and mad if I didn't wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as I said I still wear what I wear and the judgement doesn't stop at that. Her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about the way I behave WhY YoU ARe NoT SmiLing and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. She would always try to buy me stuff I don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something.When I think about all of this and other stuff I understand why im so incompetent afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. It's not all her there are things I probably could've done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now I need to find a way to get back on track somehow.Also today I pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings I stored inside. I don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling.P.S if there was another post made by me that's titled the same blame my stupid phone for this XD.

50798,50981,It's easy to say that everyone has worth. If I say that I am a worthless subhuman most people will react by saying something like everyone has intrinsic value and that you don't need society or other people to validate your existence. And while it may be theoretically true it's also easy and generic.What is difficult is to feel that you actually have value when such a big part of your life has passed without anyone seeing that value in you. I'm not a bad person but frankly I'm barely a person. I'm unable to do the majority of things most people do. I lack any semblance of personality. People forget about me and that's totally reasonable. Everyone likes me but not really. No one cares about me or is really interested in me.I have acquired major schizoid traits throughout the years to the point that sometimes I'm not sure if I need human connection anymore. But I find myself craving external validation. If there's no one there to believe that you matter do you really? The obvious answer is yes but I'm not so sure anymore.,Personality-disorder

51243,51473,Tired of needing Communication Skills to survive in this world. As someone with a speech impediment Childhood Apraxia of Speech and currently undiagnosed AVPD along with selective mutism Its frustrating that this whole society seems to be based off social interaction. Im almost 18 and realized that I should be looking for a temporary job by then so Im not a complete failure living in their parents house no offense to anyone who does I set high standards for myself. I see everyone else around my age and younger getting the easiest jobs where they literally just have to sit at a cash register all day and they get some good money. Its frustrating me to my core as I can never get an easy job like them as I cant handle social interaction or talking. I try to look for alternative jobs but every single one of them pops up with Requires excellent communication skills or Verbal communication required. Even working as a stocker or in a kitchen apparently requires communication! For the life of me I can not communicate well with people as I automatically freeze up and go into panic mode inside. Even at the small school I volunteer at I can barely even force out a word I just do my job silently before leaving. They probably are only letting me help out of pity. I even considered being a police officer for a while until I realized that you needed communication for that too. Im more fucking scared of talking to people then of tackling down murders. Today my girlfriend was looking for tutoring jobs and I just cried seeing how easy it is for her and everyone else not having to even care about social interaction. I hate living in this world thats built around people who can talk.,Personality-disorder
51567,51841,I haven't been diagnosed yet I haven't been diagnosed with AvPD but I think I may have this disorder. I was always an anxious child then in my teens I started taking panic attacks before any social situation but mainly before going to school so I stopped going to school I just avoided it. I'm now nearly 30 and I've never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance. I feel like I now avoid anything that causes me the tiniest bit of stress by not leaving my house sleeping and not letting anyone know about it. I then get really depressed and disappointed in my self. It just feels like an endless cycle of me not showing and getting down about.

Never been diagnosed with AvPD as I am too scared of asking my therapist what he thinks since by his writing he doesn't seem to care much about PD labels and I'm too afraid I will look like one of those people who tries to be cutequirkyuniquespecial by hunting for diagnoses. But I resonate a lot with the stories and thoughtsfeelings I have read from people who have AvPD and a lot of it sounds like things I have saidthoughtfelt almost word for word.I'm curious if anyone here can relate to my childhood or if I'm being overdramatic. I won't go into it too much because no one cares about my stupid sob story about why I'm a loser but I basically had a very emotionally dismissive mom it's your fault for being upset and an explosively angry father taught me it was NEVER ok to say no. Since both of them worked all day I was pretty much raised by my older halfsister who had issues of her own obviously and she would constantly bully and belittle me. My halfbrother essentially ignored me when I was growing up. I was also constantly bullied in elementarymiddle school for being weird and shy and had to see therapists that I didn't want to talk to when I was as young as 67 years old.I'm 26 years old and have never datedkissedhad sex with anyone and have never made any attempt to do so. I don't have any friends except on the internet. I used to think a partner and friends were things I wanted but thinking about it now I feel like either as a result of my upbringing or maybe some other brain failure I'm really not capable of loving anyone. I'm not even sure if I love any members of my family. I can also never be 100 comfortable in a room with someone else no matter how long I have known them for because anything that would involve me being me I would need to be alone for. Anyone relate or am I just a sociopath?,Personality-disorder
51344,51589,Trying to explain the main difference between Social Anxiety and AvPD One of the most common questions on this subreddit is the difference between SAD and AvPD. Lately I've been trying to put it like this Social anxiety I'm afraid they'll see how nervous I am fear of embarrassment AvPD I'm afraid they'll see how inept I am fundamental belief of inferiorityOn top of that AvPD is more severe prevalent in every aspect of life and persistant there's no periods where you DON'T feel it whereas SAD is situational you might not feel anxiety in every social situation and go through periods where you feel lessno anxiety. But the belief of being inferior has to be the main thing that sets AvPD apart from SAD. Because of this deeprooted belief every social interaction everything someone says can be taken as rejection and therefore as a confirmation of our beliefs about ourselves. Even positive situations can confirm these beliefs 'they like me now but once they really know me they'll hate me' or 'they're only pretending to like me'. Another thing is the belief of inferiority often shows up outside of social situations e.g. avoiding doing homeworkwriting essays or even hobbies because you feel like it wouldn't be good enough.Does this make sense? Please correct me if it's too generalizing. I might delete this post later,Personality-disorder

51420,51680,I think I have AvPD avoidant personality disorder I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off Im very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping. I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. Im not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level. I dont really open myself up to anyone. Im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. Im close enough with my parents that I dont get anxious around them however I still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. I have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. Whenever Im at work I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience I overthink everything and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like Im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when Im asked questions and I dont feel like Im much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by. I play it safe. Ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like its more than just that.,Personality-disorder

Its weird I get along with most people I come into contact with but also actively avoid a further friendship from any of them.The only pressure I feel to have friends is because its viewed as odd for a female to have no friends. my family members all have friends or people they hang out with..Me I isolate with my dog in my room 247 I even play games alone now couldnt handle having gaming friends anymore. the only person I talk to is my cousin.

51153,51379,Boyfriend broke up with me over my AvPD I was already thinking about breaking up with him just because AvPD made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didnt necessarily do anything wrong but its still gutwrenching. Im not necessarily heartbroken I just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to I get you have AvPD and you cant help it but its your fault this isnt working out. He was sick of me constantly ghosting him never directly communicating or confronting him about anything and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult.I already feel guilty enough about the way AvPD makes me act without someone I thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways I ruined this for him all of which just so happen to be things I already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me. In situations like this people usually say some shit like its not you its me or go easy on you right?Not to mention one of his reasons was that I was ghosting him while I have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so I genuinely didnt have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond which feels like maybe he shouldve been a tiny bit more understanding of but in terms of the big picture I guess I understand. It still feels like shit though. Ive never been broken up with before and even though I wanted out since the week he first confessed to me I dont know if Ill be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know I was the bad boyfriend and everything I was insecure about I have every right to hate myself for.EDIT After I panicblocked him on all social media he is now anonymously harassing me on Tumblr to confront me about it and generally being very childish and kinda fucked up and creepy so.

50753,50934,I made a friend for the first time since middle school when covid hit I became very isolated since I was doing school online but last school year I went back in person and there was this person that would approach me but I was too shy to really talk to him and I finally built up the courage this last september to actually approach him. I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving kind and patient. He's assertive out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful. His attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general. I feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space.

50639,50806,I cant sustain long conversations It doesnt matter who the other person is if we are engaged in a conversation the longer it takes the more symptoms I get. At first I am ok then the worry begins in my head where at the same time I am talking I start observing myself. The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear my ears turn red my lips start to shake my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. Later on as days pass I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. After sometime I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. I am 56 and have been like that since High School. Some medications have helped particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes. This is all from times in my childhood where I was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts uncles grandparents and teachers. One of my grandmas used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when I did something bad. So for some reason now when I talk to other adults it triggers all of the reactions I had as a child when I was getting yelled at.,Personality-disorder

50678,50851,How to not hurt peoples feelings I think Im doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally dont interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I cant always have a recovery. When Im socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof disinterested monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them Im just worn out.Usually with strangers it doesnt matter that much because Ill never meet them again but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc. and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying but Im just really irritated right now for reasons other than you and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and theres no reason you wouldve known this Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I cant manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because I at least want to preserve their feelings. My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me do you hate me am I annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent its a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about. I cant handle navigating those questions when Im socially overstimulated but I dont want to make her insecure worse either.

51372,51620,Irritated with oppression Olympics between AvPD and Schizoid PD Tw angry rant ahead What the hell is the oppression Olympics between AvPD and SzPD all about with some people on this sub? There are all these casual mentions of things like well my life sucks but at least Im happy I dont have SzPD that keep showing up lately.Why not just say something about being relieved not having to experience social anhedonia? Its not the only symptom experienced by people with SzPD although it seems to be simplified into that.I dont understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they dont experience social anhedonia.Experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with Schizoid PD. It would be like saying people with ADHD are choosing to be inattentive.Also there is a lot more to SzPD then the one symptom that some people in this sub seem to be hyperfixating on.

51151,51377,studying makes my AvPD symptoms worse. This might sound really weird as I've never heard about it here or anywhere else but I've noticed that when I make a mental effort especially to learn something new I seem to change my personality and I can't laugh I get surly my mood gets worse. Also I get hypervigilant when I see people on the street I look at them as if I've seen something scary. If I don't study for a week my symptoms improve a lot and I become more sociable and relaxed. ps Studying means being focused for a period of time on trying to absorb some content well as mathematics or philosophy for example. I know that everything I said may sound meaningless or strange but can someone enlighten me or give me some tips? Thank you very much in advance.,Personality-disorder
51507,51776,Taking 24 hours or days to respond to texts? Hello lovely communityIm reading a lot about this mainly to understand the guy Im dating better who has AVPD!My lovely community please help me understand why it takes often over 24 hours to respond to a text from your loved ones?Is there specific content that triggers you to avoid replying I.e expression of feelings? Yet I hear that the AVPD community does enjoy getting reassurance.Sometimes it makes me feel like theres a lack of interest but I often end up getting a reply after all just days late . But its confusing to determine wether you are disinterested or just afraid to answer. Love to hear your thoughtsexperiences,Personality-disorder
51232,51460,Hello new here Hello everyone lurker for a small while now. I'm 24M.I'm in the process of getting diagnosed cause my life is shit and I continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship. Everything points to AvPD according to the psychiatric place I'm being diagnosed in so I figured I'd check out the sub some time ago. I resonate with a lot of people in here so I felt like I'd chip in a bit.I've essentially lived in complete isolation for 34 months now except to buy groceries on sick leave from my vocational school only very rarely seeing family in that time. All social interaction is through online games not that this has ever really been much different which I do think help ground me a bit more in reality. I know that some of you guys have gone years without even that and I'm sorry to hear it. I want to get better finish my education have one or two friends a Roma tic relationship and a job. But life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen seriously fuck living like this.I'm getting a little hope from knowing more about AvPD and that I most likely am about to be diagnosed so I can get help but even still I've had times today where I just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. I'm scared of getting hurt so I've never attempted suicide even though I've fantasized about it a lot. I also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear.Anyways onto more nondeath related shit earlier I ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat. I really hope they got the note cause I look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths. Besides my apartment looks so bad I'd rather not have anyone look inside so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace.That's all I have for today besides all the shit everyone here struggles with I wish you the best possible day,Personality-disorder
50616,50782,Why do people always come with this remark? So i just started supplement license beside my real licensehope its understandable. We have to drive some lesson and i was with a new driving instructor. Finished my lesson and he gave me some tips. One of Them was i dont need to be a mouse at this point i just felt insulted. Why is there always a expectation to be talkative? Yeah im gonna drive people around most elderly but im gonna try as much i can. Im seriously tired of society always expecting everyone to be bubbly and talk constantly.,Personality-disorder
51211,51440,I'm a burden 20F I moved back home to help my mom lessen the load that's on her with houseworks physical illness and a stressful season at work. I wanted to get a job to aid the financial situation and to do as much housework as possible so that she'd be relieved.Instead I'm avoiding all the job opportunities high on anxiety if I manage to land an interview rejecting the final offer in doubts of my ability to fulfill the employers expectations. I can't imagine myself doing any of the jobs properly so basically I don't even try them.And not only that I've drifted into depression again and have regular involuntary outbursts of crying even in front of her. Which of course puts even more pressure on her.I'm a burden I live off of my parents not contributing due to my goddamn diminished self worth and avoidant patterns. I have a therapist but the sessions are just once a week and of course it takes time to establish what we're working on and to start changing the patterns. It's been a month now though and so far so avoidant and depressed. I'm starting to get impatient because I don't want to be a burden any longer. Kinda wishing I never existed because if I unalive myself now it's going to be just as much of a burden as if I stay alive avoidant.,Personality-disorder
50784,50965,Im so desperately lonely I want more than anything to have connections and close friends but at the same time Im scared of anyone getting to know me. I get so remorseful of the fact know one really knows me or gotten to know me properly and Ive never felt like I could be my full self around anyone and its all my own fault. I feel like Im not good enough to have friends or acquaintances whenever people talk to me or give me the time of day I feel like theyre just doing it out of pity or theyre just talking to me so they can laugh at me to feel better about themselves.,Personality-disorder
51299,51537,First real date We walked in the park for like an entire day then the next day watched a movie. We kissed which was my first time doing that cool. But it turned out she wasn't as into me as I was her. So its over all for the best. I'm feeling so positive about it. It was painful for the first couple days after no lie but now I feel great.I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to make a move sexually but I did it. It was awkward as hell obviously but I did it. I was bold as fuck. And it was really no big deal. I saw her again the other day and it was totally cool no hard feelings.I finally feel like a real living human being. It's like I've been set free in a major way. Only a year after I asked out the first person haha. Feels like a lifetime ago. I never thought I'd actually get here and I'm so grateful that I did. And I have so much time ahead of me. I'm only 24. I used to look at the future and see only dread and misery but now I see hope and promise. Thank you thank you,Personality-disorder
50958,51154,Two days ago I tried to kill myself Has anyone here attempted suicide or seriously harmed themselves. Two days ago I lacerated my wrist with a knife and had to go to the ER and get stitches. I nearly severed an artery luckily I will make a full recovery but I feel a deep sense of regret and shame that I did this. I don't want to get into too much detail but it happened in front of my family. I also tried to to choke myself with a piece of clothing and physically assaulted my family as they were trying to stop me from hurting myself. I feel most guilty over this as I am normally a very passive person but I let my own emotions take over and didn't stop to think of their wellbeing. I do not come from an abusive family at all they love me which is the reason why im not on the streets right now. I have been in a really bad mindstate for years now due to isolating myself but this was all my fault and obviously i need to take responsibility for my own actions. I have a deep sense of rage underneath myself which i try my best to mask. Most people who post here seem like good people but i feel like i'm not. I'm terrified I might be a covert narcissist.,Personality-disorder
50653,50820,Devastated after finding out my little sister has a secret boyfriend Not sure if this belongs here but I'm so upset about this that I haven't slept all night. My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts interests and even my mental health struggles. I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything. Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities. I knew this day would come my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone abandoned and betrayed. She never mentioned that guy to me and my father I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything. Of course I want her to be happy but now all I'm left to do is wait for her to get married move to a different country and forget about me leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone.,Personality-disorder
51521,51790,BPD and AvPD comorbidity anyone? Lately Ive been reading more about BPD particularly silent BPD and I check off every symptom on the list. Im wondering if its a common thing for these two conditions to be related as it seems that this combo could be incredibly self destructiveas I am and hectic. Thoughts?,Personality-disorder
51004,51205,Do I leave this friend? She's been a friend of mine for 5 years she's caring loyal and she's always been there for me but she has this habit. If she's upset she'll ignore the shit out of me she'll snap at me for the smallest of things without warning. I've told her she has the right to be upset and express herself but she can give me a heads up instead of ignoring me and making me feel guilty. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. I asked this on a avpd reddit because I already feel lonely I can't imagine losing her as well. What do I do?,Personality-disorder
50548,50708,Dating apps even harder with AvPD Disclaimer I dislike dating app culture in general. There's a hell of a lot more to a person than a few pictures and prompts.If I'm not attracted to someone then I won't swipe on them. If I am attracted to someone and there's even one thing on their profile that I lack or don't relate to then I won't swipe on them either. If there's someone I'm attracted to and there's nothing problematic in their profile I won't swipe on them because I doubt they'll be interested in me. In the end this leaves a very very small pool of people which I guess makes the whole thing pointless?,Personality-disorder
50669,50841,I haven't been diagnosed yet I haven't been diagnosed with AvPD but I think I may have this disorder. I was always an anxious child then in my teens I started taking panic attacks before any social situation but mainly before going to school so I stopped going to school I just avoided it. I'm now nearly 30 and I've never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance. I feel like I now avoid anything that causes me the tiniest bit of stress by not leaving my house sleeping and not letting anyone know about it. I then get really depressed and disappointed in my self. It just feels like an endless cycle of me not showing and getting down about. I'm just wondering how AvPD affects others and if there is anyone from the UK suffering from AvPD Thanks,Personality-disorder
50521,50678,My first therapy appointment in a long time I have had bad luck with therapists in the past but decided to try again. I am mainly going to overcome a fear of driving. I have driven before back as a teenager and the process was going well but there were some things that happened that then hindered it. Before in therapy I didn't have specific goals and I don't think that helped.,Personality-disorder
51506,51775,Has therapy ever worked for you Ive tried counselling and schema therapy but it always ended the same way as i realise talking doesnt solve deep mental issues but Ive seen cbt and dbt therapys and wounded if anybody has any experiences with it and was it beneficial.,Personality-disorder
51218,51447,does anybody else get overly hurt and offended when somebody comments about how quiet you are? Ive been the quiet girl my entire life and I cannot tell you how many times during school and now work Ive heard people tell me how quiet I am. One of my teachers once called me the quietest girl theyd ever known and I would always get called a mute or asked if I ever talked. And I cant explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it I have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off. I dont even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse. I would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me theres something wrong with me over and over and its all I can think about. I hate it. I know Im not normal I know Im quiet I know I dont talk much so why does it hurt so much when someone tells me that?,Personality-disorder
50504,50659,I am hurting Lately I just feel like garbage. I havent left the house much in like 2 weeks and I've been missing class. It all feels too overwhelming for me but being at home makes me feel like trash too...I cant win. I cant sleep right either. I wake up every other hour and im so tired....I feel so angry and anxious lately too because I feel as if everyone hates me and that they're happier without me. My friends hardly talk to me lately. I see them on social media chatting and making plans to callplay games and im never included lately. Im not surprised though. Who'd want to be friends with someone as depressed and broken as me?I want to crawl in a hole and disappear ,Personality-disorder
51130,51355,the irony of it all I recently got diagnosed with AvPD after probably struggling with it for 8 years I thought downloading reddit would give me some kind of comfort as there are communities on certain topics on here that are easily accessible but as Im reading through posts I have zero desire to comment on anything or make any connection at all and exited the app with the thought of probably never replying to anything which is the irony of it all. But I do wanna let you know of my existence I will probably not ask questions or share details of my disorder but I still exist and I still have a voice and fingers to type. Im real even if it sometimes doesnt feel that way. Thanks for reading..,Personality-disorder
50730,50909,Im scared of going to college Im a senior in high school and after being on this subreddit for a month Im terrified of going to college. Granted I was terrified before that. Before I figured Id take a gap year to figure things out and I didnt feel like I was in a good position to do well in college. But now Im realizing I was just avoiding applying because I was scared to be rejected. Or maybe I was scared of what would happen if I was accepted. I dont know what I want to get into and its scary how relatable a lot of these post feel. And what scares me more is that I keep seeing posts about people having to tell their parents they dropped out of college. Is that going to be me??? Am I just going to be a drop out?? Should I even try?? I dont know but now Im worried Im going to get to comfortable once Im out of school and will be too scared to return. Uuugh everything is so frustrating I wish I could just be normal and I dont know what to do but Im curious to know other peoples experience with college,Personality-disorder

51061,51273,Went to school today to get a confirmation that I will be dropping out principal scoffed at my situation. My teacher already told me that it's impossible for me to continue the next semester. I already know that but she told me it needs to come from the principal itself for confirmation. So we went to him just for the confirmation. Now the principal went on and on about me coming to him begging for a second chance... Which i didn't. I just went there for a confirmation. I already know they're not gonna give me a second chance. I didn't come there to beg.He then went on about how I don't really have anxiety because if I do have anxiety I would have found a way apparently he knows because he has anxiety too. The thing is I DON'T HAVE ANXIETY. AVOIDANT PERSONALITY DISORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM ANXIETY. He then said I'm just making excuses and I just got lazy. I'm not asking them for second chances I know right from the start they are not gonna accept me anymore but I don't appreciate them making fun of my shitty mental health. That's the thing with this disorder we literally avoid things to the point where it affects our whole life. He was acting like i went to his office crying and kneeling down begging to give me a second chance he said I know why you came here to ask for a second chance when I literally just sat in front on his desk and agreed that they can't give me another chance. I wouldn't have come if I knew he was gonna make fun of my disorder. I only came because my teacher said it needed to come from him for it to be final. Now everyone thinks I'm just making shit up. It also doesn't help that my country doesn't have a GED. I wonder what their faces would look like if I killed myself? Wouldn't it be funny? They make fun of my mental illness and then the next day they get the news that I killed myself?,Personality-disorder
51522,51791,is it wrong of me? i am not diagnosed with avpd. i think i have it but i wont say i have it. ive shown a lot of symptoms since childhood. im 18 and usually they diagnose people who are older so yea idk. ive posted on here several times and feel such a comfort with all the people who relate. ive lost friendships because of how i am. its so nice to feel understood and to connect with other people like me. i dont know where else to go to vent so i usually go here. all the people who comment really make me feel better since they get it.,Personality-disorder
51052,51261,Affronting the world edit I'm not native I directly translated affronter but I guess face the world is more common to usemade me realize how little I know about anything. Once you start to avoid it's a never ending cycle. You seek to forget the real wolrd and once you try to avoid the avoidance you understand how much you're behind to the point where it seems impossible to catch up.I have dropped highschool a few years ago. Never studied more got a diploma or worked. don't really have any friend never had a partner. I get too anxious with anything social even multiplayer games. In the past 6 years I have left my house like twenty times. I'm driven by AvPD and have very poor hygiene due to selfneglect and depression. I'm not skilled in anything not particularly intelligent either definitely not physically gifted and absolutely hideous.try to get a normal life with that background lol. I feel worthless I have so much shame against myself it sounds so hard. For the first time I want to find a way out and not rot in my room for the first time I have ambitions. It's so hard. It's like living was not made for me I think I was a mistake not supposed to live this far or at all.I'll keep trying though. wish me luck,Personality-disorder
50910,51102,Rock. Bottom. I'm at rock bottom right now. I'm about to lose my job my next work day most likely and be jobless. Family is so disappointed in me. Everyday I'm in survival mode at work. Avoidance had bleeded into my job and I can't help it. The anxiety is too crippling and it makes me do all sorts of weird awkward shit at my job. My chronic isolation outside of work also seemingly killed my social skills so I feel numb to all interactions. I sense a mental breakdown is about to erupt and I'm likely to walk away the job but I'd rather get high and lose my job over marijuana then quitting. Either way I'm doomed. I have a bad reputation in my job at this point my real self is being exposed coworkers for sure shame gossiping me. My coworkers all have strong connections with each other now and I'm still that one insecure awkward shy guy. So ashamed. Worked my warehouse job over a year and half now. Idk how I made it this far but my behaviorial symptoms have caught up to me. Literally avoiding everything at work and everybody. Hide in bathroom during breaktimes. Avpd and depression worst combo. Consequently I didn't save enough money while working this warehouse job not only for myself but for the sake of my immediate family as well so everything about to come crashing on me. Addictions make saving money hard even at the sake of supporting family . I let myself down and my family. Sighhh. What a crippling hell of a condition avpd depression is. No excuses. I can't even leave my house. I can see myself being homeless potentially in the near future. Everything that involves making a decision I literally just can't do and that includes getting help. Ik this was a lot y'all just wanted to vent . Your not alone if reading this keep your head high I don't mean to bring u guys down . If you're making progress I'm proud of you and that means a lot for me and the rest of avpd sufferers. Thanks for reading!,Personality-disorder
50839,51024,I think I may have AVPD anyone relate? Ive been in therapy on and off since 2015. Ive been diagnosed with Major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and bulimia. Recently Ive been diagnosed with ADHD too. Though recently Ive been thinking something more is wrong with me. Ive been in therapy and been on meds since 2015 with med increases and it helps but in stressful times or when I forget to take my meds I go back to the same thought patterns. Recently theyve been coming up. What makes me think its AVPD because for the past decade and a half Ive always felt inadequate and not good enough no matter what I do. Its rare for me to think Im good at something but even then I feel like Im bragging and being obtuse or being narcissistic. Objectively Ive had success Ive been to a reputable college and for grad school I went to an Ivy League school but I feel like its a fluke. I constantly feel like a nuisance and a burden. I regret and am critical with most of my reactions with other people and assume everyone is tired of me or thinks Im annoying even though no one says anything or gives me one statement like whats up with all the talking.I dont like to be the first one to call someone a friend because I want to make sure they feel like they are my friend. I dont want to impose myself on them and I assume they dont want to be my friend. Even some of my friends now I get into episodes where I assume they dont like me but because theyre nice they tolerate me. I dont like to reach out to them first because I dont want to bother them. I dont follow up with friendships because I dont want to bother anyone. Theres people that I loved to spend time with and liked them as a human but I dont want to bother them at all so I avoid. I dont really date. Ive had dating apps but I can only use them if I pay for the parts that lets me see who likes me first and then I go from there. Regarding jobsworking initially I would take the first job offer I got because they wanted me because I would assume Im not good enough for any other place. I tend to be the person since high school to primarily only speak until Im spoken to or is asked to speak otherwise I stay quiet. I only have a handful of friends that Ive known for at least a decade that I ask to hang out but otherwise I usually dont initiate conversations or social events. If I do it with high anxiety and expectation of rejection. Criticism is also detrimental to me. Ive gotten better at it in the past year or so but it still just debilitates me. I feel like a failure and want to run away when I get criticism. So basically because Ive been like this since high school currently 30 Im thinking I have AVPD. My job is social and interactive with people which makes it seem like I dont have it but my impostor syndrome is so high unless I get verbal confirmation from others that Im doing good. with everything else I assume Im a bad person and I need to isolate andor disappear with family and friends and coworkers. Does anyone else relate? I have a therapist and Im going to bring this up. TLDRI think I have AVPD because of my baseline fear of rejection criticism wanting to have close friends but feeling inadequate andor like a bad person and I dont want to initiate friendships or relationships unless they confirm they want to be my friend andor like me.EDIT I think Im looking for anyone who thinks this might be AvPD andor validation? Idk,Personality-disorder
50880,51071,is it avpd? for basically my whole life i have been scared to get close to anyone. getting close to people and trusting them with personal things about me terrifies me but i want to experience it so badly. i feel as if i come across basically like a cold bitch to most people because i struggle to give out compliments or say i love you to anyone especially family. it just feels embarrassing in a way.another thing is that i hate it when someone likes me too much because i know that i can't give them back what they expect from me and it makes me feel so guilty. i had a very average childhood with my parents divorce when i was 5 being the only significant thing i can think of. my dad and his new wife bring up to me all the time that i'm distant and cold and that i need to make more of an effort and i'm trying my best to but even just simple things like calling his wife by her name takes so much energy out of me to the point of wanting to breakdown as it's so overwhelming. i just like don't trust myself or my judgement at all and can never tell what level a relationship i have with someone is atand idk where any of this came from as i don't remember being any differentis this avpd or something else?,Personality-disorder
51250,51482,Avpd Adhd anxiety being an adult. Me again having another midlife crisis? I can't function in life. I have adhd and may have a bunch of other problems so I don't know if it's related to avpd or not. I forgot to take my thyroid hormone two days straight and I also didn't buy my antidepressants for some stupid reason. When I finally went to buy them they were out of stock. So yesterday I was super sad and vulnerable and also feeling physically drained like was going to pass out. Then came the anxiety and crying. Today thanks to my mom I bought my life numbing drugs after being scolded like a kid and I'm having another melt down. I don't know who I am anymore. Am I this mess of a person or is it the drugs? When I'm ok am I really ok? I feel so incompetent so stupid so weak. I can't take care of myself. My house is messy even though I try every single day to make it beautiful I have no job and zero courage or motivation to get one no independence. I feel so scared of everything of being alone in the end and dying alone. And knowing my life depends on me taking the thyroid hormones doesn't help. I need people so much but I'm terrified to reach out and be rejected. I'm afraid my husband will leave me even though he is super caring and loving. I'm afraid once people see the black hole in my chest they'll run away. I shouldn't need another human being like this since I'm in my 30s already. Don't even know where I'm going with this post. I just feel like life is incredibly hard for me but only in my head. I have it easy and I'm struggling to survive and maybe it'll always be like this because of avpd....?,Personality-disorder

51518,51787,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know but in the platonic sense too.i don't even think i'm physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera.don't get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age i feel like it's too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people.but i think that's okay. somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food.there's some days when loneliness hurts though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.You think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont. In fact you feel more alone than you did before you left But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. Bojack Horseman,Personality-disorder
50715,50893,Do therapists even understand AVPD? I generally like my therapist. I think he's the best one I've found so far. But today's session just proved that he doesn't understand. And I admit that my inability to open up is a barrier to make much progress. But I heard the same generic advice....go out. Meet people. Do something fun. And that's not BAD advice. Probably should do that. But the problem is every time I go out I feel anxious selfconscious and ashamed. I don't even think I have social anxiety. Shy but not on that level. I can handle BRIEF infrequent surface level conversations. Anything more than that is a nogo. So I seem more outgoing than I am. And it's like he focuses on my lack of relationships so that's what I bring up. I think it's because he's a solutionfocused therapist and he doesn't seem too concerned about the pastunderstanding one's self. Just do it pretty much. CBT. Opposite of feeling action. Which is all true. But honestly I isolate because I'm depressed. Which is why I don't maintain relationships or want to put myself out there. So I don't know what to do. I don't know what my problem is. I'm just over it. Older seasoned avpders if that's a thing any advice for me? Should I stick therapy out or just forget it? He's like the 3rd longterm ish therapist I've been with and I don't want to dump him out the blue like all the rest.,Personality-disorder
51357,51602,I got a raise I've worked as a baker at a cafe for a little under a year and here bakers are supposed to also answer the phone and take orders have some cashier training which I just... couldn't really do so we worked out a tentative agreement for me to only do opening baking which is only about 25 hours a week.Today my boss told me that I've been doing really good work and that he's over me not answering the phone because it's obvious I care about what I'm doing. Now I've got more hoursresponsibilites the same days off every week PTO and a 2.50 raise! I started here when I was still in high school so this kinda feels like I've done something to prove myself as a real employee even though I never really think I'm doing good at all. But it gives me so much hope that even if I'll never be 100 with communication there's still good qualities I have and people can appreciate them. The thing I'm happiest about is that they know I care. Because I really really do and I didn't think there was any way to express it.,Personality-disorder
50722,50901,I wish I could socialize normally and make friends No matter what social setting Im in Im always the odd one out. I feel like I physically cant talk. I only speak when someone initiates and even then the conversation just ends almost instantly cause of my bad social skills. I wanna be normal and be able to make small talk and actually have relationships with people. I feel so alone and I dont know how to change. Im 22 and wish I could have friends and go out like other people my age. Was considering going to the Disney college program but I know itll just be the same no friends and Ill just be the weirdo everyone avoids. Please I really want to change my life I need some advice. Did medicine or therapy help any of you? Did anyone get better on their own? A part of me just wants to be courageous and force myself to talk to people. I know Ill be unsuccessful but maybe Ill get better with time ,Personality-disorder
51481,51744,AvPD diagnosed recently Hey all I was diagnosed with AvPD quite recently and finally I guess after all those years spent in confusion what is wrong with me. I finally got an appointment at psychologist we were doing for the first few hours screening process turned out I do have AvPD and I met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with BPD. Also he mentioned that I do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. But after I read his diagnosis this evening he wrote that I have Other personality disorder. Which idk how I feel about that. Like I do not belong to anything even in this. And when I started to talk to him about feeling really depressed and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today he just said that we will talk about it next time in a two weeks. And I am so confused about this like no one really care especially with the suicidal thoughts. And feeling I do have no one to talk. Or maybe I dont want to? I dont know. But this is making me super super lonely and more depressed. No one really cares..,Personality-disorder
50869,51059,Ghosting a client and stressing myself out daily Hello. So I woke up stressed again and thought I should really open up here because maybe others are going through something similar. Long story short Ive had such a hard time with finding and keeping work and part of it is because I have difficulty communicating especially when things done go as planned. Ive gotten so behind on a project that I feel frozen. The days and weeks just keep passing by and I keep avoiding talking to the client about the true status and stress keeps growing. Im afraid to even check my emails most days. I know what I need to do and I know I need to talk to the client so that I can move forward and also so that I can get paid but I really feel frozen with shame and avoidance and stress. Frozen is the best word to describe it. I hate these feelings.,Personality-disorder

48717,48722,Can stress cause missing hunger cues? I know stress can cause a lack of appetite but can it cause hunger signals to disappear entirely?I have been dealing with an extremely stressful situation lately on a waiting list for therapy atm. The stress has been making me feel Ill mostly low energy soreachy headaches and stomach pain. Im used to losing my appetite when stressed or grieving but with this situation I havent even been feeling hungry. Like Ill go straight from fine to my stomach hurts and is growling from being empty with no warning. At the point when my stomach starts hurting I force myself to eat something but it is difficult since my appetite is gone so nothing sounds good and it seems counterintuitive to eat when I feel nauseous. When I am able to eat it is much less than I normally would. Is this a normal stress thing and how can I deal with this without making myself sicker or ending up with an ulcer?,Stress
48960,48989,Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is for example I have these goalsFind a good job OR start and grow a succesful companyFind the one who will marry me in the futureFind out which religion is the true one read the whole bibleSo my idea is I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burnout. If I choose goal 2 I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3 I will read the bible a few hours every day but I will not do any other productive things.What is the good side of this by my own thought?Whichever goal is the most important one OR has to be completed the fastest can get priority and full focus By only having one thing to work on you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time so you can avoid burnout and instead work at your own pace. careful do not get lazyWhat is the bad side of this by my own thought?Spending hours everyday on the same goal only can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea so if you have goals that require less time per day you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this 1 goal only idea.These days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time study have a job have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist and even worse sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory it is very real.I have a burnout. I have been stressed 247 for a really long time because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done I had to spend all my free time on dating apps I had to go to gym etc I had no free time left.So my plan is to only work on one goal at once and spend all free time as actual free time to relax or enjoy it.Question is this a good idea or do you see any flaws with it?,Stress

48681,48686,Do you ever feel like youre in a losing battle between your doctor and your job? Or is it just me? I have two bloodcirculatory autoimmune disorders that are not that difficult to regulate but can get annoying sometimes because I often have to go to more appointments than Id like. Also depending on the job I may have to ask for accommodations. The last manager that I asked for an accommodation basically insinuated that I was lying and even when I proved it with a doctors note she was still very rude about it and acted like I was asking for something ridiculous other than needing to get up every two hours and walk around for five minutes because of my poor circulation. I have been let go in the past due to taking time off for medical conditions but of course they dont say that its because of medical condition they just say Im taking too much time off. So I cant claim ADA discrimination. Ive been at my new job for a little over a year now and they are so flexible and have no issues with me taking time off but of course I built up this wall because of previous jobs and Im always terrified to ask for time off when I need to go to a doctors appointment. My doctor is like your health is more important than your job and you need to make this work so that you can do everything you need to do to handle your autoimmune diseases. Obviously my health is more important than a job but he doesnt think about the fact that companies dont give a shit about health and if I lose my job due to taking time off I wont be able to afford insurance or pay outofpocket for him. It stresses me the fuck out and I feel like each side is pulling me without considering the consequences.,Stress

What my stupid company didnt bank on was supply chain issues with getting key integral parts to operate equipment so they kept delaying our end of work date for the past 12 months. When I found out that I was to be laid off a year ago this July I stupidly told the lady I rented my basement from about the news but seeing how at the time my company didnt announce when our actual end date would be due to supply chain issues she took it upon herself and guessed that my end date would be around May of this year and I will have been moved out so she went ahead and rented the basement out to a family of three. This was a major jerk move on her part. Seeing how I am really strapped for cash and couldnt afford to get another apartment for me and my dog with not knowing when I would actually be moving out she offered for me to move into her sunroom this past May until my end date and she she would move her mattress into her living room to sleep in. My company finally announced that our end of work date would be at the end August this past May and I unfortunately have to stay on working and living where I am due to those reasons. Seeing how this past year has been touch and go with NOT knowing when my company would announce this end of work date and with not knowing when this opposed announcement would be happening I thought it would be stupid to move somewhere else and have to sign a lease for however long so seeing how I live month to month here I chose to stay. Since moving into her sunroom it has been a friken nightmare. She consistently picks on me and flat out accuses me of doing things that I havent done. I am not allowed to flush the toilet unless its brown she accused me of killing her precious plant I have to keep the sunroom door shut during the day so that the heat doesnt come through the whole housefriken stupid stuff like that. She has gotten a bit too overly attached to my dog as well and drops stubble hints about how happy my dog is living here my dog and I will be relocating to another province to attend school so I can upgrade my current skills at the end of August. Just this past Wednesday my friend got word that she has to go work out of town this week so she offered for me and my dog to go and stay at her place to get away from the madness here and also mind her cat. When I told the lady this she mentioned how this wouldnt be a good idea and how it would disrupt my dogs routine with living here and how it is probably super hot at my friends apartment meanwhile she has no air conditioning here. The first night there wasnt so good because my dog was in unfamiliar area and she was all nervous and panting a lot. My dog has done this many times before when camping or going away for a holidayso I got her some calming spray to see if that would help. My dog and I came back to the house last night because I have my car scheduled for servicing and a garage which is literally 5 minutes away from the house so instead of staying at my friends apartment we came back here to sleep last night for getting to the garage would be way easier in the morning. When we arrived back last night the lady in question was like ohhh she is so happy to be back of course she would she is in familiar surroundingshowever seeing how well be moving at the end of August and staying in hotels over night and other friends placesstaying at my friends apartment is a good trial run. When I mentioned that to the ladyshe munched up her face as if to say ohI dont like the sounds of this. So I am at the point with waiting for her to literally say to me why dont you just leave your dog with me and that is when I will snap. Thanks to all who read my vent,Stress
29432,29452,He brought me to hang out with the two of them a few times. I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship this is another thing I'm still thinking about. My best guess is that my touchy ness comes off as flirting and he thinks I'm trying to take him from her? I do casually say things like I love you a lot too which just worsens it from that perspective.

I tried to talk to my parents about switching programs or go to university with less expectations The University I'm going to is known to be brutal to their students. Sadly that didn't work which I understand from my parents side if I get through it then it will pay off. The next two years for me is just going to be quite scary as I'll be doing a Full Time course load in the Fall Spring and Summer for two years straight. Just ranting I guess and some sort of motivation would be nice honestly.School for me has always been a stressful topic and has never changed even in high school I'd say I've always been so anxious or stressed about the topic. Though what I can say is that once I do the two years at least I am out and finish my degree and I can move on from the idea of school.

48789,48800,im over thinking everything i'm a 18 F freshmen in college I have been going to this library on campus for the past few days there has been this recurring guy im assuming 1819 that I have seen every time we have never spoken but have made a lot of eye contact I have been there. there have been some time where the library was packed and I had to sit at the same table as him and vice versa today I was sitting alone at this table that me and him have sat at together a few times and he came over and sat at this table with one of his friends. Eventually one of my friends showed up and soon after his friend left this left me my friend and him at a table that seats 4 people soon after one of my other friends showed up so all the stats at the table where filled. we where all just working quietly for around an hour. after that hour he later left and my friends left soon after. I spent another hour there by myself finishing up some work I am a big glancer I look around a lot whenever I am doing something so this has caused me and this boy to make a lot of eye contact. when I was taking a break from my work I saw him coming back into the building me and him made eye contact and he quickly walked away this was a bit of a surprise because he usually sits down I assumed that he either wanted the table for himself or he had some friends coming and needed a bigger table. so I moved seats I got up and went to a single table. I went to go fill up my water bottle after I placed my stuff down at the new table when I was walking back to my new table I made eye contact with him again because he was walking the same direction. I sat down at my new table and put my AirPods in assuming that he moved to the table that sat 4 people out of the corner of my eye I saw him walk up to my table. I took my AirPods out and he asked me hey you didn't move seats because of me right? with ought even thinking I just quickly shook my head and said oh no! before I could say anything else he said ok I was just making sure have a nice day and he walked away. I ended up soon leaving after just beacuse there was no way I could focus after all of that but now im worried I have scared this boy off and ill never see him at the library anymore.

48815,48828,Stress when working It's hard to explain I'm guessing its some sort of stress but I can't figure out how to get over it. A little background. Before the beginning of Covid Lockdowns like right before I had a major breakdown and went into severe depression. My sister was about to go through a life saving organ transplant which went well I had someone break up with me I had 2 major career defining projects I was leading that weren't going well and I was suffering from a torn labrum which stopped me from doing a hobby I loved. All of this happening in the span of about a week.It took me a long time to get out of my depression. I took medication stopped worrying as much about having a great career learned meditation and practiced it daily found a new hobby and tried enjoying life more over the span of the pandemic. I decided to make it a point to get away from my previous job as it caused me a major amount of stress. They overworked me and the pay wasn't great for the amount of responsibilities put on my shoulders.It took me nearly 1.5 years to finally land a new job and leave that job behind. I have fantastic bosses at my new job they pay me well and make sure that I'm compensated for my overtime whenever that is necessary which isn't often. The only complaint I have about my job is it's a bit boring and not very challenging or at least it shouldn't be.Now here's my major problem. I'm falling behind on my work and not learning at the speed I use to when starting a new job. I'm having difficulties learning all the systems and parts even though most of my job is just surveying equipment and designing simple parts and cable assemblies.Every time I start on a new task or job I start experiencing a dull stress and what I think is brain fog. It feels like the top of my brain just hardens and I get a mild headache. Over the day it drains me but once I get off work I start quickly recovering.I use to thrive doing challenging work and continually learning new things in my field. Now I just feel tired all the time. I'm tired of feeling like this. I've asked for more challenging tasks from my boss and I get them but it doesn't help.I just want to feel unburdened again at work.,Stress

48529,48528,To those who give car rides UPDATE IN COMMENTS Im a college student from out of state. I left home because I didnt like the environment I was in and being out of state was one of the best options. I dont have a car and its mostly a public transportation type place so its not the biggest issue. I dont ask people for rides unless I really need them. If we go out Ill tell them we can take the bus. On rare occasions if I need it Ill ask for a ride. I was getting close to someone and only then did I ask them to take me to target twice once we went the other we didnt and the second time I really needed to go for a project. So you kinda get the jist of it. When I need to go to and from the airport I has rely on others this is one are I need help in because Ubers are so expensive also I only need it after and before the winter summer and one thanksgiving break. I generally dont care too much about its safety because I feel its generally safe but this one time its kind of an issue. I also would like to mention that I dont really have friends in school. Anyways I ended up contacting many MANY people. They all basically said no. The flight would come in at around 12 AM and none of them could pick me up. I honestly got angry. My thought process was that Im literally in a bad situation I need a ride and no one can either wake up or cut their plans short? It honestly just made me so frustrated. I get im not your best friend but a girl taking an Uber at 12AM1AM isnt okay for many. Im not the type to go out a lot so its uncomfortable for me. I get its late at night but it just made me feel like people are selfish. I hope I never treat others the way I feel when I ask others for a ride. Because it feels terrible and Im not saying these people are the exact reason why I feel this way. Im sure its an accumulation but it just feels so terrible. I hate having to beg and pry and ask. I hate asking for a ride so I do try my best to get there myself.

When I was a kid we had much less to choose from so playing the same videogame over and over wasn't a problem... these days we have tens of thousands to choose from and I own well over 1000 of them. This is my only major hobby by the way which is a problem in and of itself. I used to wake up and immediately starting playing something to keep away the feeling of dread in my life because I suffer from depression and anxiety. Games have been my only escape from that nightmare for many years. I'm finding now that I can't seem to find interest in them anymore. I have hundreds of games I've not even completed and I want to finish them but the motivation just isn't there. I will seriously stress myself out flipping through all of what I own trying to find one that catches my attention and nothing ever sticks out. I never had this issue 5 years ago but now I'll juat gwt frustrated panic and sit at home on my day off doing nothing because my one hobby seems useless to me now. I dont even know how to engage in other activities because I've been on the same pattern for so long. I really juat want to be able to focus and enjoy gaming again. This all sounds seriously dumb when I wrote it down I almost don't want to post this because it feels that stupid but it genuinely makes me miserable.

I'm a 22 female and my job is reporting and introducing new stores and foods on TV. It's creative and fun but because of the unstable income my mother doesn't support me.I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there. I don't let that get in the way with work though.Anyway. Today this random stranger during my break time came up to me and looked directly into my eyes and said You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.She kept holding my shoulders and gently rubbing them and I have no clue if this is hypnosis I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good peopleAnd little by little the weight in my shoulders started to get lighter. And it felt fuzzy. I had this feeling why does she know my family? Can she read me? Am I readable? Is my aura out? I'm about to panic! Then I just burst into tears and had to control myself to do the next reporting.It was such a confusing experience because she was smiley nice in her 50s lady. Can someone tell me if she was a hypnotist or if she can see my soul or some angels or if she was just an empath that knew I was extremely stressed and wanted to let me know I was stressed. Because later She was motioning to her friend her shoulders like letting her know my shoulders were super tight or scrunched up.I don't know... It was such a coincidence.

48622,48622,I feel like I'm becoming too sensitive.. or that I'm offended by everything. Wasnt surrounded by very nice people nice places or nice things. For the most part growing up I feel like I had some pretty thick skin... then as time went by and life took its toll on me the stress anxiety and depression happened to wear me down. I don't feel like I have a hard shell like I used to. Almost everything people tell me I feel like rubs off the wrong way whether they mean it or not. I can take a joke but when it comes to general comments or statements I possibly overthink and get upset over it. At the time I wanna give a smart remark but hold myself back often..

48878,48896,The relationship between stress and infertility Some couples get pregnant easily while some do not despite trying for a long time. There could be multiple factors contributing to difficulty conceiving but of all of them stress plays a significant role. Stress does not directly cause infertility however it does impact the chances of conception by delaying it. Infertility has become very common now and the factors contributing to it are multiple ranging from physical causes and dietary changes to even excessive use of gadgets. There is enough research to prove that stress can adversely affect a couples chances of conception naturally or through medical procedures like IVF. So what is the relationship between stress and infertility? The science behind stress and infertilityWhen we are stressed our brains release cortisol a stress hormone that interferes with the signals between the brain and the ovaries thus disrupting the ovarian cycle and the release of the ovarian eggs. In the case of men sperm production and motility are impacted. Apart from the bodys response stress contributes to behavior and mood changes too. There is a decrease in the desire and motivation to have sex. There is an increase in smoking or drinking alcohol in order to cope with stress which in turn causes trouble with conceiving. Understand the vicious cycleStress and conception are highly connected. Most often couples who are trying to conceive become dejected when it takes a longer time. Some find the medical procedures involved in the process to be taxing. For example most couples going through IVF procedures are often stressed out. This in turn affects the biology and behavior of the couple thereby creating a vicious cycle. Stress management is thus necessary in order to break free from this cycle which in turn would help a couple conceive.Managing stressSome amount of stress is normal. However if one is continuously anxious and hassled by circumstances around them it will deeply impact conception.

30127,30147,I was in a rabbit hole of youtube videos over the weekend starting off from music videos then vine compilations and then somehow fight videos. On one of the side videos I noticed a video involving XYZ high school where my boyfriend attended.

And there's no doubt that this was him.,Stress
48975,49006,Friends Is it normal to constantly worry about my actions around my friends?I M started worrying about whether my friends or at least my general ones were just about putting up with me. I feel as if I am unwanted around people I consider friends. Conversations seem to start with being lightly involved since I'm present at the start and seem to be directed at other people say I was with 2 others they would talk between themselves. I may be overreacting which is probably the case but it seems when playing football during breaks at school I seem in no way involved like my other friends are.People I like as friends seem to disregard me in most things for example if I had a group project of some description with groups of 6 I seem to be the 7th person constantly.I also feel that I do not want to let go of my friendships how rough it may be on me due to me having no other people to turn with.I don't want to be alone that seems like a bad life to lead but again it appears that sometimes for others sake not just mine me distancing myself from them would not be bad.This does tie into rstress in a way that I am not myself but the person others want me to be constantly aware of my actions hardly any of them I would do of my own accord. It is sometimes tiring.,Stress

48539,48538,Stress Relief in Making Things So last year I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it lack of space where I live but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so usually to keep warm more than anything and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is pour some in the grinder to make sure.Was it expensive? Well getting everything together was about 260. With all the payment apps out there it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes mochas I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process satisfaction in these product and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy but friends and family can as well.My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring there's plenty of resources. If you like writing maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food all kinds of classes out there. But all in all make something for you first.,Stress

But my mental problems are turning me into a vegetable in a couple of years I will not be able to leave my house or get out of bed it is nearly impossible now even when I do not feel suicidel.I have no friends or family.My plan is to use my allergies. it is going to be painful but not as painful as everyday life is.

18463,18483,I sold my house back in March. Its been a rough run since then. The plan was to capitalize on the increased market value with the housing market how it is. My wife and I were planning on building a house with the proceeds. It was supposed to be done in May. They built the wrong house on our land by accident made us pay more for less house. Its been months of staying with shady airbnb hosts family and finally an apartment we had to sign a lease on just hoping the house will be done around the time the lease expires. My car caught fire 2 months ago and the dealer is still working on reimbursing us. My grandfather is getting old and does not remember me anymore. My great uncle who I was very close to died. I had to put my dear sweet cat to sleep that I never thought id love so dearly god I miss her. My grandmother has cancer. I cannot bring myself to talk to my disabled brother because doing so just reminds me of how neglectful I have been of him since I was younger. I started a new job months ago that I am out of the honeymoon phase of and I am really starting to wonder where my career is going from here. I do not talk to anyone anymore. I see three people on a weekly basis for four months now two coworkers and my wife. I do not even get to play with my old gaming buddies anymore since our schedules do not work out and I cannot find any new ones due to my weird work schedule. I am so lonely. Fuck I am so lonely.I do not think id ever actually do anything to hurt myself. Id never want to put my wife and family into that situation but god I think about it all the time. I just do not know what to do anymore. Been a hell of a year,Suicidal

7409,7429,I am currently in a living situation that is far from ideal and becoming unbearable. I need to move out but I feel immense guilt and concern because of how much I am needed here. Ill start by explaining my relationship with my family. Older brother X My mom and I immigrated from Cuba when I was 4 years old. I am now 21. We had to leave X behind we are 11 years apart and he did not come to the US until I was 16. Because of the cost of communication and our extreme poverty throughout those years X and I did not get to know each other at all. When he came he felt like a stranger that I was expected to love because of our blood relation. From the ages of 1621 he has engaged with my body in sexual manners without my consent grabbing my ass slapping my ass getting on top of me removing my clothing forcefully entering the bathroom when I am showering and looking at me naked etc.. No one is aware of this except my therapist. I should mention that he is an alcoholic and some of these instances occurred when he was under the influence. About 2 years ago he moved out with his girlfriend but they recently broke up so he moved back home. I am now living with him again. Younger brother Y Y and I are also strangely enough 11 years apart but on the other end. He is such an impeccable human. He is my best friend. Watching him grow up has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. Unfortunately the responsibility is too much. His dad passed away when he was young so it was only him my mom and I until 2016 when X moved to the US and joined us. My mom had to work a lot and I was relied on to take care of my Y. This had an extreme effect on my education extracurricular social life and mental health. I did not sign up to become a parent. Apart from financial support Y relies on me for everything. My mom relies on me for everything. Mom This is of course the most complex relationship I have. However I will not go into as much detail. She treats me like a child does not allow me to see friends constantly making homophobic remarks does not know I am gay constantly offending my expression or lack thereof does not support any of my decisions forces me to shave armpits and legs because it is gross and is unladylike cannot talk to her because everything turns into an argument.... the list truly never ends. But she needs me to take care of Y translate every document upkeep the house etc. I understand her pain and suffering. She has been through so much. And I know she truly does need me. This is why I am still here. I am needed. I am afraid of what will happen to them without me. But I am tired! Of being used disrespected neglected uncomfortable abused... I am so exhausted. I need to focus on my life. I need to prioritize myself but I cannot. I am stuck. We are all currently living in a small 2 bedroom house. My mom is sleeping in the living room while Y and I share a room and X has his own. I am in college but because of the pandemic I am staying here. I probably will be taking the upcoming semester off because its too difficult to do school here. A few weeks ago I was suicidal and I almost did it but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not. I am in therapy for severe depression and learning how to socialize. I also experience derealization often. I do not know what I want to receive. I just needed to release. Thank you for listening. I was suicidal and I almost did it but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not.,Suicidal

I have been sitting here all night staring at the rope,Suicidal
24439,24459,21MA couple weeks ago now was my latest attempt to end my own life. For years my mental health was stabilizing getting better each and every year. Then this year with the pandemic relapsing depression my girlfriend breaking up with and a new stressful job has led me down a very dark rabbit hole that has gotten out of control. Then I finally tried taking my life again. I was found by my parents hanging from a tree unconscious and losing my last bit of oxygen. I was taken to the hospital literally just in time where I got tested and treated for my injuries and then held for my own safety for a week. My life is back to normal now but...I want to try again.Last time I did not have a note prepared now I do. I bought a new rope And now I stare at the rope for tens of minutes before something else distracts me.I want to die so badly... and I do not know what I can do anymore.I do not have enough money or insurance for counseling or medications so I do not know what direction I should go towards. Also none of my 'friends' are serious enough people to where I can to them about what I'mIt feels like such a pressure on my chest that only death can get rid of.I am so sick of the typical it is selfish or people will miss you arguments since it is obvious at this point I do not give a fuck about that. I know it is bad to think that but it is REALLY bad right now.I feel so lost guys... I might just actually try to end my life again... I failed my attempt but I want to try again.,Suicidal
13051,13071,I have been struggling a lot the past week and a half and reaching the point of exhaustion from battling my want to die. I have had depression since I was 17 23 now. And since graduating from college in March 2020 I have been pretty neutral about life not necessarily un happy but definitely not excited about things. I got into a great and healthy relationship in march that ended a couple weeks ago. Its hard to process because we talked about marriage and kids and started taking steps to me converting to islam. But he said last week the shame of being in a relationship haram was too much and ended things. He still says he loves me I am his best friend that hell never meet someone who cares this much for himwill be as accepting and willing to learn and adapt to his culture and faith. He still wants to keep our friendship and be best friends. I have been struggling majorly with trying not to end my life every day since. Not in a emotionalspur of the moment decision but more life I have tried for years to make myself want to live thought I finally was getting the future I had always wanted and now I do not think I have the energy to try it all again. I have gone as far to research carbon monoxide poisoning from car exhaust or jumping of a local parking garage if I cannot wait until I have a free house for option 1. Basically I am struggling a lot and am asking for more options. I went to a psychiatric facility for 3 days once and it caused more trauma and distrust of my family and the mental healthcare institution. Are there options for daily therapy where I can still maintain a source of freedom? I really do not want to do inpatient or intensive outpatient but more like a support group of some kind. Thank you everyone Options other than hospital or kms? Looking for help and support,Suicidal

Losing her has been rough on both me and my father.Today I had a particularly awful interaction with a customer at my job and it caused me to have an anxiety attack. My boss felt bad so he gave me the rest of the afternoon off. I arrived home 2 hours earlier than expected and walked in on my girlfriend having sex with my father.I completely lost it and verbally threatened to attack them. They called the police and now I have a citation to appear in court for making threats.I feel so betrayed by the only two people I have left in this world.I am so alone right now and I want to cut my throat and bleed out.

26683,26703,So i first posted here back when i was 19 and a few years and a pandemic later here I am 22 years old and tbh still struggling with a lot. I do not lash out anymore or self harm or really abuse alcohol or drugs or various other things to feel something like I used to but if i was an emotional wreck back then I am now an emotionless one. The sometimes overwhelming and always constant feelings of loneliness never left me but that is about all I feel nowadays and even though I used to do some fucked up shit I still felt something whether it be pain or sadness or a whole range of emotions. Now i just feel empty and when I decided to change my life and take me off a path which was inevitably leading to suicide I sure did not think this is where Id be today. My insecurities about being alone and having no one who cares whether it be family or friends have grown massively to the point where I have sorta just accepted that this is how its going to be. In a post I wrote back then I said i was afraid of eventually pushing everyone away now I am afraid they are just gunna leave. People who know me see me as being better because I am no longer the guy who would get black out drunk and end up hurting himself or the ones around him but tbh I have not sorted my issues out at all I am just better at hiding them even better than before. Its not that I want to die trust me I have been there and I know i never want to go back to that but I do not want to feel like this but the thing I have no idea what to do. Back at the start I had clear issues which I could deal with better e.g do not abuse alcohol at every opportunity but now I have more different issues which are just as painful and make me just as sad. I know I am just in my own head and its not real but honestly I do not even know anymore. I think I am pretty good at picking up on things and that coupled with my fucked up thoughts all in my head create scenarios and illusions but it gets harder and harder to tell what is real and what is not and so ultimately I guess I have been through so much pain and hurt that i just automatically have accepted I am alone and no one truly cares about me just to end that suffering and it just sucks a lot. Sometimes i wonder if life was better back when i was too fucked up and unstable to care about who loves me or whatever because I did not plan on living much longer or if I actually successfully killed myself then none of this would matter. But suicide is not an option and its not like i do not want to feel better and feel loved but i do not see any light at the end of this tunnel just empty lonely darkness. Lost Soul,Suicidal
15920,15940,I sometimes just want to commit suicide to show my friends that I am being serious and this is not a fucking joke.Its selfish but I am so fucking frustrated to such a point that I want to kill myself to prove a fucking point. I want them to hurt. I want them to regret. I want them to repent. I want them to feel like they could have done better because all I asked for was the very bare minimum and it turns out they did not even try. Its so fucking frustrating when people think you have shit sorted out and are happy when I am telling them to their face that I need help. I cried for help in explicit terms and yet somehow my life does not seem to be fucking worth even five minutes of their life.Idk if Ill go ahead with suicide but if I do this sure as hell is a reason I did it. Nobody helped when all it took was for them to be with me for atleast five minutes a day to talk about random shit. Fuck those who could have helped but knowingly made a choice not to. Please do not ask me to find better friends. I gave all I had into a couple of people I love. I genuinely do not have it in me to build a bond with anyone anymore. I am done.Ill probably kill myself this month or the next. Time is running out. Is feeling this way normal?,Suicidal
14013,14033,Sometimes when I am listening to music that I really like I imagine myself being the person who made the music... I think of how people that I like or important to impress around me would see me and think I was amazing. I think this is a very narccistic thing to do but I have done it for a long time now. I expect so much out of life and reality can never fit the expectation's in my mind. I want love like love in the movies I want to love and receive love. I used to think maybe I was too pathetic and sensitive for this world but the more I look at myself I realize that I am the problem. I am not a good person I am so insecure and pathetic that it is dangerous for other people around me. My fears and insecurities are forming me into a terrible person and I do not have the energy or motivation to fix any of it. My mentality is so messed up I sit here and think nothing I do matters since I can just kill myself. When people push me to get motivated and do something that thought crosses my mind I think of threatening my life if they try to push me. Of course I have never done that but how long will it be before I do? I sit here day after day reading these posts from all of you guys finding some sort of messed up comfort from others being in my position. Part of me thinks its okay to be suicidal because others out there are too. I could right a book on why I think I should just die. it is like I am waiting for someone else to tell me I can do it. That it is the right thing to do... and even after I post this its possible for my mentality to completely change. I will think no I am worth it no I can do this. But I do nothing to change everything is in my head. I do not want to do this the rest of my life if everything is in my head I will only be met with disappointment in pain on the outside. This includes my own actions and mistakes. I just do not think that I am cut out for this world. I do not know anything anymore,Suicidal

23826,23846,Normally thoughts about unaliving only last a day maybe two. I am on day 3 and no sign of slowing. I know this does not sound like much but I am slightly concerned now about whether I will ever actually stop hating myself. Apparently a guy at work sayd I was funnier than usual when I apologised for how I might have behaved a couple of days ago and I told him I would been feeling pretty rough. did not go into any detail just said I had not been doing great. I have things to do today some that I have been putting off for weeks some that are timesensitive. One needs to be done as soon as possible. I just cannot seem to make myself focus on any of it. My brain feels like a jumbled mess with some waves of self hatred. It will not stop,Suicidal

17323,17343,Every time I try to kill myself I plan it out get the weapons ready and plan a time and day. But before I can complete it I always fuck it up by subconsciously crying for help such as telling my friends and family I love them over and over again in a suspicious way or telling my friends I think life is meaningless how can I stop this How do I stop the subconscious cry for help,Suicidal
21186,21206,I do not feel myself alive for a long time no matter what i do. I have no desires for suture anymore and no desire to continue this worthless and painful travel forwards. Nothing to live for I have none of those reasons to live which you all read a lot in posts and on websites. My thoughts are about death my night dreams are often about death. I have no desire to go further with life to plan something to do something to dare... I am tired of it.I hope I will find strength to end my life this Summer. Then I will have peace and rest finally. I almsot feel that I should have killed myself long ago,Suicidal
8788,8808,I know this sounds extremely melodramatic and like I am just over reacting... but I have been feeling like this for a while. I want to not exist. The only thing holding me back are my parents and grandparents they will be so sad if I died. One of my best coping is sports. I do gymnastics weightlifting and volleyball. And I love them. Frankly the only thing bringing me happiness in my life. Its how I destress and release my anger towards myself. But I recently had an knee injury and its just been confirmed my mri I have a complete ACL torn. The whole process of surgery and rehab will be 912 months. I cannot do what I love during those times and by the time I can get back Ill probably be much much worse and have to pick it up from scratch. I have been away from sports for 2 weeks now and already my mental sanity has taken a huge fall from its already super fragile state. I am also known as the sporty person and I do not know how Ill survive being in crutches in school. I just do not know if its worth it. To go through the process without any coping mechanism. I want to kill myself now if save me the trouble the mental stress. I just want to die. because I do not think life is worth it. I am so angry with myself and I just want to... dieI have been making so much progress coming out of covid in gymnastics and weight training but now... it was all for nothing I guess. I feel like I am being over dramatic but this was the last straw... the only thing kept me going in life. The only they kept my mental sanity in check. Plus many of my friends are from gymnastics and volleyball and now we will just drift apart... and people will think it was my fault for injury... I do not think life is worth it... recent sports injury,Suicidal
17111,17131,I have a good life I was born rather smart and had a super easy time going through school. Others always had to work hard while I could easily slide through everything. I live in a middleclass household in a rich country I was never abused I have friends. But I am still just so incredibly sad all the time for no reason. The only thought that keeps me even going is how much harder others have it. there is literally people who lived in hell for their entire life so how would I deserve to end myself? Why tf am I so sad,Suicidal
7247,7267,I often feel the only way to make people take my depression and possible underlying causes seriously is to actually kill myself. Especially family who I feel are supportive in some ways but downplay my depression. They do not take it seriosuly when I say I cannot handle work and life. A certain family member is the worst stating before that I just get a little down sometimes that phrase still makes me want to punch a wallor that he notices others inc himself feeling depressed in winter or that he had trouble keeping a job when he was younger. He gives terrible advice that just makes me angry do not feel you cannot take a vacation. That does not solve the problem of the actual job! I am sick of being minimized.I feel and maybe I am wrong its just minimizing my condition. I mean hes supportive in other ways. But I am still angry and I feel killing myself is the only way to win the argument I feel having failed at anything in life the only I can have the final word or any control is to kill my self successfully. A failed attempt will only make me more of a failure. I mean I know there has to be a better way to deal with this I just do not know how. Confrontation will not help Ill just sound more desperate. Staying my true feelings about everything to everyone will not help Ill just embarrass and maybe isolate myself more. I can discuss with a counsellor but that often just feels like talking. Its not an solution its not even leading to one. People only take action especially irreversible violent action seriously. How to make people take your condition seriously without having to kill yourself ?,Suicidal

15629,15649,When we were still together.23rd of december 2019 my then boyfriend killed himself by hanging in an psyciatric ward. A week before this he had taken a lot of benzos and i had been at a night shift. So when i came home in the morning i went straight to bed. I noticed he had fallen asleep on the couch but i did not want to wake him up. 6h later i wake up and go to pee and whatever you do when you wake up. When i passed the trash next to the kitchen i noticed all these emtpy benzo boxes. I rushed to the couch and he was drooling and could barely keep his eyes open so i smacked his face not as in abusive but trying to wake him up and calling his name he was kind of awake but like a zombie. So i tried to get him to stand up and go to the bed to sleep it off i was going to call for an ambulance but a month before this he had taken a box of paracet and i called the ambulance and he got so mad at me but i did not care about him getting mad i was going to call but as soon as he got up on his feet he wanted to have sex. I tried to lay him down and told him we could not because i was tired etcetc not trying to put it on him and that he was a fucking zombie at the time. But he pushed me to the bed and held me down i almost could not believe it cus a minute ago he could barely stand and now he was pushing me on the bed basicslly trying to do it against my will.He could not get an erection because of all the benzo and i was relived. But he started crying saying he was not a man cus he could not get his dick up so i started comforting him? Telling him we could watch a movie or anything else to get him distracted so i could call the ambulance i know i should have done that when i saw the boxes in the trash cannot do much about it now But his manhood was ruined so he needed to go out and take some amphetamine. And when i tried to block the bedroom door he took his hand around my troat and squeesed and pulled me away and threw me on the floor. He then looked for his wallet and phone so me being filled with adrenaline got up and blocked the door going to the hallway. He then toon a knife and pressed it against my throat and said I have stabbed my brother imagine what i could do to you and i just remeber telling him fine alright. I will move away from the door now and i did and he walked off. I looked out the window until i could not see him anymore and when i could not it was as if my whole body just went numb. I remember falling to the ground because i could not feel me kneeslegsanything waist down and cried while calling my best friend who is on the other side of the country. She had to guide me on who to contact cus shw knew i had made two new friends in the city. So i called them both 1st had visitors so i just hung up called my bff again and she told me to call the other person my now boyfriend and my ex's best friend and he had to guide me through the phone on what to do step by step. He told me to get a bag how many of different clothes and to get out of there and he would meet me at the 1st guy i called apartment. I stayed there for a week i did not dare to answer my then bf calls texts or even tell anyone where i was cus i was scared of telling any one else what had happened. So i turned off my phone. A week later my friend got a call from the police cus they knew i was there. And they told me it was critical and i had to get to the hospital.He died that day and i was planning to follow him to the other side. Both me and his best friend my now boyfriend.. idk found each other in grief? Lifted each other up we understood each other and what we went trough so we fell in love and all of a sudden we both wanted to live for each other. It happened fast not going to lie. 2 months later we were in a relationship.Now my ex's family is blaming me for his death even tho i had already 'saved' him 5 times from suicide in 10months before i met him he had tried to take his life 30 times or more. Idk why i let his family make me feel like shit but it fucking sucks and it fucking hurts knowing that these people knew what he had done how many times he had tried before and now i have to suffer from it. I am still with his best friend and he honestly saved my life. I know i should be happy with just that but i cry everytime I am alone and i talkcry to empty rooms and empty chairs basically shouting at my ex's ghost. Its everything from telling him I am sorry to yelling how much i hate him for what he put me throug.Idk what i needed from this post maybe just to share it cus his familu does not believe me. They believe i cheated cus i got together with his bff 2 months after his death.If someone made it this far please tell me how to move away from this I am so tired of feeling like it really was my fault My ex killed himself,Suicidal
19126,19146,I do not know what to do. As most of you know staying at a psych ward is extremely expensive. I do not want to go to geisinger as they do not give a shit about you and treated me like trash when I was in a ward last. But I am extremely suicidal and I cannot handle it anymore. I have been suffering for years and no matter where I go or what I do I cannot function. My mom is telling me I need to go to the emergency room and I can tell them to take me somewhere besides geisinger. she is working and too busy to take me. On the other hand my dad is worried about money and he is set on the fact that psyche wards are prison as he has been at one....I just....I do not know what to do. Are there any places that can be fully covered by insurance or anything at all that I can do? I do not feel safe being alone and I have no other options left. Please someone just help me.I am struggling severely with Depression Hallucinations Anxiety social anxiety and panic disorder...and i cannot work at all due to these issues and I am having trouble being self sufficient. Its embarrassing and obviously you need money to live....I have a therapist and a psychologist but they really are not helping like...at all. Meds for years have never worked. Countless therapy and psychologist appointments. Nothing. I live in Pennsylvania and I have Blue Cross blue shield insurance. If anyone had any success getting fully covered or found a place that really helped them please feel free to comment. Please help me,Suicidal

16529,16549,My life is unsalvageable. I have always been the ugly weirdo. Nobody has ever really valued me. I am either treated with contempt or ignored. I have never and will never experience the parts of life that make it worth living. I have thought about it a lot over the years and I am certain that killing myself would actually be the smartest thing I could do at this point. The only thing that lies ahead of me now is a slow decay getting uglier less capable mentally and physically and even less valuable to others and society at large. There is legit no downside to me being dead. I would not be missing out on a damn thing because you cannot miss out if you do not exist but as long as I am alive I will be needlessly suffering and missing out. The only problem is I am afraid to kill myself. I am afraid I will fail and end up maiming myself but being kept alive by idiots who think they are doing something good. I am also fucking angry that my life has been nothing but a waste! you would think I would get to have one beautiful experience to make all the fucking misery worth it but nah. To conclude life is bullshit and I cannot wait to be taken the fuck out of it. Suicide would genuinely be the smartest option for me at this point,Suicidal
8327,8347,it does not seem like there is a point to being happy or living at all when things just go back to the sad and lonely defaultno emotions or feelings at all seems a lot better than even feeling happy because i know the happiness will end. its fleetingits comforting knowing that death means i do not need to feel any more emotions or feelings. and that absence of feeling will always be there once i finally do it why is life just a cycle of fleeting happiness then crying and loneliness,Suicidal

11865,11885,I am at my wits end. I grew up in a broken home parents who physically fought and abused drugs and alcohol. I was abandoned by my parents as a teenager and had to look after myself and meet my physical needs from the age of 13 I had no one to give me love and emotional support for that I turned to unhealthy habits. I grew up hanging out with a bad crowd and we were taken advantage of by an adult we should have trusted. I have made terrible decisions about people I let into my life because I was not shown what a healthy relationship was I have witnessed my best friend drown I have lost countless friends and family members before I even turned 20. Yet somehow I climbed out of these dark holes I am nearly thirty and still learning how to take care of myself adult things that no one showed me. I studied at someone of the top universities in my field have experience careerwise so am able to get a job to feed myself and put a roof over my head. I have travelled extensively and currently live abroad my friends often express their envy of my life. But the thing is I am miserable I am tired of it all I want the memories to leave I want the pain to stop. I have been to therapy but the memories do not go they are still there and I do not want them anymore. I figure I have two options to end it all and forget or pack my backs live a life free from any worry these options feel like two sides of the same coin for me. Because if I end it all I might as well ignore the allconsuming anxiety that takes over my life. I am so over it. I just wish I had a better start in life instead of continually being dragged down by my blackenheart. Life has been hard and I want to forget it,Suicidal

I mean if any attempt at fixing this mess is met with constant failure.. What can I do???? So I just exist to fail and suffer? that is it? I do not want to kill myself but what are the alternatives? Doing nothing and suffering or doing something and failing and suffering. I mean I tried so much and so hard to change things but it always fails!!! So what the fuck I am supposed to do now? Try again and fail again? I am tired of this. I am just so fucking tired of this fucking bullshit. This is so fucking dumb. what is the point seriously? Why do I even exist?

12944,12964,Nowadays my friends it is hard to find the warrior spirit anymore. People have forgotten. It is indeed too much to ask for a noble because to die for. We immerse ourselves in pleasures and delights that do not give us the long awaited glory. We have been enslaved broken bent. I do not want to die an old frail man into this absurd circus that the world has become. Me and a few left still have the old spirit. But to die at war nowadays is not what it once was. We die for politicians that do not care for us. For the rich. If it was for me I would put them all to the sword. I want to die. But first I need to achieve glory. But what is glory nowadays? What do we worship? What do we do when confronted by this question? Sex? Worthless temporary pleasure. Drinking and taking drugs? Temporary again. What unites are an action? What is the utmost answer to these pathetic clowns that they throw at us? This day and age I cannot die for my country as I do not believe in it nowadays even if I do believe in our spirit. I will have to end it all in some years before I reach full maturity. I will die. I will die indeed. I crave for death so much. But still. There are things to do still in this world. In order to achieve enough to be able to die. Glorious death in this day and age.,Suicidal

Feeling like Ill be trapped in my current living situation forever. I just keep trying to improve and falling flat on my ass lolBefore you say some shit like its all my fault and do not blame other people for my problems I fucking know okay I know its my fault I just wanted to rant about how much living in my fucking brain and body suck to me and how hard it is to feel like there is anything worth going on for Beyond tired of my life,Suicidal
14971,14991,Lately I have come to the realization that only the other people in my life are keeping me alive. I do not want to make my family sad I do not want my friends to talk about me like the elephant in the room I do not want my pets to be alone. But my will to live is completely gone at this point. I walk down the street without looking hoping a car will just finish me and pray for an accidental death. Something that will not label me as a suicide but I am not so lucky. Nothing specifically happened I am just tired of feeling like this. It feels like I have been drowning for the last 15 years and am just now realizing that I drowned a long time ago. But I worry what will happen when I die. My sister has struggled with depression and suicidality for years and I have been her support. I worry that she will take her own life if I do. My mother has always been on the more delicate side and has admitted to me that she never fully recovered from my sisters past suicide attempts. I am not sure she will recover if I die. The list goes on. I have become an important support network for many and its left me with no one to talk to. Its like I am being held hostage by the people around me and I feel so stuck. I wish I could just go away and be forgotten about. I think I have reached my end,Suicidal

26863,26883,I really want to die. Everything is pointless. I honestly do not see the point in living. Like logically speaking I am not enjoying my time here so why should I stay? Its frustrating this has been a terrible week for me really. I have been isolating myself more than usual. I am always in my room only leave to pee and grab food. I did not even do that this week. I starved myself for 4 days. I starve myself often bc I do not feel I deserve to eat and just want to waste away. I wish I could kill myself like this but it takes forever. Anyways that led me to thinking about these tylenol pills in my bedroom window. I have 14 and you are not supposed to take more than 10. I could easily take these right now and no one would notice. Nobodys knocked on my door in two days and when they do it is not to check up on me just ask me to grab groceries or something. I guess the point of me posting is this should I do it? Just put my headphones in find a nice album and overdose to death? Overdosing on Tylenol?,Suicidal
12540,12560,I met my girlfriend only a little over a week ago at a week long camp. I am 17M and she is 16F and she lives 2 hours away. we have only been dating for a few days but we have had a lot of long talks and decided this will be worth it. For the past couple days she is been talking about how horrible her life is and this morning she told me she is trying really hard not to kill herself. I know that she is a gorgeous and intelligent and amazing person and she does not see that but I do not know how to help her. She said all her life she is wanted was a boyfriend that she can love and be with and I know that I am not enough being 2 hours away. I have been complementing her and trying to remind her of all the good things in her life but there is only so much I can do when I am not right next to her. Her parents are strict and they are starting to take her phone and I cannot help but feel like its all my fault. I know that her life would be better right now and her problems would go away if she had never met me and I really want to be with her and I am here for her on her worst days and her best but I just want to make sure she is there for her best. I know that the only thing that would hurt her more than her being with me is if I left. I really really like her but its killing me to see her like this and know that I am not a enough of a reason for her to want to live. I am going to keep trying to help her see the best in herself and the world but I do not know how else to help. I do not know how to help my girlfriend,Suicidal
23391,23411,HiI am a 28 year old she will of a man from the UK suffering with severe depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment now I am what I call stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day I have been stuck alive too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything believe anything want anything feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair I know this is happening I just cannot stop it meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a fulltime alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself I am openminded but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore prepandemic I was doing my dream job still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available being mistreated at each company of course I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our preexisting issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted I do not need money I just want fulfillment I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem! Maybe I am??? Am I Dead?,Suicidal
20385,20405,its hard knowing I am the only one. everybody i see everything i interact with is just so I am unsure. not not real per se just... generated. i feel so lonely. surrounded by mirror images that speak and move and communicate with one another so intricately while i am burdened by an impossible solitude.this post will not stay. I am not letting 'people' i know offline see this. i do not want them to think this is the reason that i was crazy all along. but why do i care? why do i spend so much time and energy preserving the happiness of these mockeries? perhaps i should give up on it.I am too young to die yet i desire an escape all the same. just wish i was not so scared of bugs. reality,Suicidal

The rope the noose the end. Work work work. Relentless pressure. Happiness a memory true joy a myth The mountain to recovery forever insurmountable. Hollow promises of help leaving you broken till there is no kind of help that will save you. The rope the noose the end. The rope the noose the end. The time is here. The rope the noose the end.

12773,12793,I work alone overnight and I decided to not have my headphones in for my nightly dose of escapism this time and to just let my thoughts wander. In the past 30 mins I thought about all the things that make me miserable my self bodyimage the fact that my bf and I have nothing in common the fact that my parents only want me around to use me for favors being unemployed after having been fired from my career job how easy it is for me to fall into a toxic binge drinking spree and my sick dog as well as the existential dread that comes with acknowledging how quick a dog's life is And I also thought about all the things that make me happy My body when I treat it right and exercise the fact that I have a bf and someone who loves me the fact that both of my parents are still around and I can visit them the freedom I have from not being stuck to some shit career position I actually hated how much fun I have when I party with my friends and how happy my dogs make me when I see their faces first thing in the morningAnd it made me realize that everything in my that makes me momentarily happy or miserably depressed are two sides of the same fucking coin and I am so sick of this game. it is a game I will never win. Nor do I care to at this point. If it was not for the fact that I damn well know I will be traumatizing those who care about me I would get drunk blast my favorite 90s alternative metal song and drive off a bridge.

19035,19055,I just do not get it. Why is it supposed to be prevented ? Sometimes I see it as a fantastic solution. Only because it will hurt other people its supposed to be prevented ? IDK then why are not these people who would get hurt let the person get to this stage ? If this sounds selfish then telling a person that its going to be better online is a joke too. Sorry to say its a fucking joke. I think when a person's thinking about suicide its already too late. Its already over. We let that person get to that stage of thinking that and on top of that we tell them fake stuff like oh its going to be better FUCKING HOW ? how do you know its going to be better. let us evaluate the pros of suicide below Ends your pain. Lessens burden of people who are supposed to stick with you. Who gives a fuck anyway. Nobody is down for you the way you would think they are. Somehow you are supposed to tough it out. Its meaningless.Cons Someone would cry for a couple days. Amazon would lose a customer.As a society we should be discussing goodpainless ways to commit suicide. We should be legalising death by medication. But no instead we choose to serve capitalism to save a life. Fucking why ? Why does suicide need to be prevented ?,Suicidal

I am done there is nothing I want to do and there is so much pain and all I can think to make me happy is to die and no one will ever understand that this is not a cry for help it is just me reaching my end before society tells us we are supposed to.

9668,9688,This is what they call a scapegoat personality. My father was one too. He was murdered and his whole estate was claimed by the government as proceeds of crime innaccurate he was a multiple legitimate business ownerworkaholic in the 2000s. It was by corrupt police that did not want him bringing information forward about them at his appeal. His confiscated assets were in the millions and years later I was told he was tortured to death in the desert two States overright before his appeal date. He died before being able to show his innocenceexpose the corrupt cops trying to extort him and regain his work and assets. He essentially worked his whole life from 4am until sometimes 12am so all daynight and then someat two different busy and lucrative legit businesses and provided employment to others not just for nothing but to be spat back at in the face by all of them. As well as miss out on his own and his kids lives.I have been physically emotionally and psychologically abused by my other parent as a child and every partner I have ever had it never happened until they had me in a place where I could not go back or escape or when there were not witnesses. I tried to buy a house with my current partner just for him to use me as a stepping stone use being the keyword and everyone else has shut me out. I have not been in contact with my old friends or remaining family AT ALL for the past two years. My siblings are messed up by our parents but are Unhealthily codependent on our mom and scapegoat me in an unnecessarily psycho way as a display of standing up for mom or you could say rage denying that she was abusive af as long as it was not being directed at them... Cool.My partner since I was 21uses me to run around for his drug habit and would force me to do the deals while abusing me out of jealousy for the people I had to speak to to get him his drugs but he will not sort it out himself or help me. And he also then threatens to turn me in to the cops as blackmail for doing his drug deals when he feels like sneering down at me or is being abusive. he is also scary af and unpredictable or should I say predictably abusive when he does not get his drugs. He takes my house keys off me and kicks me out I am part owners of the house not even sure if that is legal i told people this and no one cares he just says I am a drug dealer and they think he has a legit reason lol and I have no one and no where to go. I just did a job trial and an educational course for the last two weeks which was government funded same government that took my dads whole life away the teachers were hella old and out of touch but ready to jump down your throat as if we are all feminist militant vegans ready to complain about anything and so this course went 14 days we did fuck all real learning and played games like hangman and they gave us ALL the answers to the assessments. all of them. It was a waste of time and a joke and probably a total of 15 minutes practical experience on a forklift which was the main reason most of us signed up to the course. They cut the course short and have not even booked an instructorassessor so fuck knows if we are even getting qualified after that bs. My job trial on the last day the boss made some weird comment about my CV saying everyone lies on here I think that is what I heard? Nothing on my resume is a lie and even if it was there is no way they could or should know that they just did not trust me and had something weird in their head about me from the start. Not sure if they know my last name as same industry my dad was cleaning up in 15 years ago and they love shitting all over someone they were once jealous of. He was dyslexic and left school at 14 but just charging every day.I got ghosted by them but idc that much if I did. I almost prefer that to someone scapegoating me for something I have not done to make money again. Forgot to mention I was really anxious bc I was told I could not take the day off the Forklift course the day of my job trial and I nearly cried multiple times sitting in class while they played hangman no joke and a legit crackhead on meth got to come back from the last class of students to take up our teachers attention the whole day while she sat at his desk and he essentially did her assessments for her. She was not trying man she probably did not even come to class during her course and she got special treatment to come back and pass. At one point teacher made an example of me in front of the class for giggling politely at the person next to me joke about might as well go home instead of play hangman... As if I needed to be taught a lesson in front of the class and this methhead chick while he ignored our class all day to help her cheat. I really want to complain to my employment agency who set me up with this course as we left at least two hours early each day and I am pretty sure they were funding this. If I did not waste my time going the last day I might have been better prepared and successful with my job trial if I had not been stuck there having anxiety and playing hangman while we watched the teacher pass a bad attitude chick on meth the whole day. I find when you are a scapegoat personality what you do does not actually matter. They will bend over backwards to block and cheapshot you while they help people who do not challenge them their position or their intellect in any way. The identified patient,Suicidal
23966,23986,I do not want to be alive anymore. I do not want to be in this world anymore. I had what can only be described as a mental breakdown during the first few months of the lockdown and I had to leave my housemates and return to my parents' house where I have been living ever since. My friends have now all but deserted me I tried to tell my closest friend how severe my depression is at the moment but she just replied with I will get back to you about this when I am less busy. I am not surprised my friends have had enough to be honest. I have never been able to keep a friend for longer than a few years in my entire life they all leave in the end. I am also studying for my PhD but I have not been able to do any research for that since November. NOVEMBER. I have an important deadline of December this year and there is no way I will be able to pull myself together to produce work of my normal standard. So I have failed that too. I am just really fucking done. The antidepressants and the therapy have not touched it. I am still trapped in the prison of my own dark brain. Alas as the post suggests the only reason I am still here is because I am scared of death and what might or might not come after it. that is it. If I can conquer that then perhaps I will be able to finally free myself of this endless cycle of torture. I just want peace. My current reasons for living I am scared of death,Suicidal
19753,19773,Honestly at this point life feels like a burden. I do not see a reason to live anymore. I am ugly and short. Yeah that is my problem. And nothing in the world frustrates me and advices like Groom yourself go to gym skincare be funny be confident be yourself change yourself. You think I have not done any of those yet? Plus browsing subreddits like amiugly or amihot have depressed me even more because the supposedly ugly people there are so beautiful. I cannot cope and quite frankly I do not want to live a life where I am underprivileged.Today was my birthday too and I spent it all alone. Every time I see beautiful and nice looking people I envy them to no extent. I cannot go out. I literally broke down while walking in front of people when I saw people laughing and holding hands.People often say enjoy your life eat good food. I cannot man I am sorry I have tried it and it are not working. Like anytime I see someone happy I get jealous. Plus people do not understand what it means to be truly ugly. Please give me a fucking reason to live.To be honest I do not even want to be in a relationship now I do not want hugs emotional support or intercourse. I just do not want to live.If you will put wings on me and throw me from a mountain I would become a stealth aircraft. I am tired of my life.,Suicidal

22469,22489,For the past 23 years I spent my time diving deep into text about the universe spirituality being positive etc. I have officially lost my mind. It gets too deep. I do not know what is real anymore and the point for anything and I have become numb. Numb to a point where I feel like I am always a Asshole or idk. I generally care for anyone but everything is so hard to do now a days. I cannot seem to make my family proud. I am lazy I do not feel like cleaning up. Its too hard to keep eating I lack desire to eat or move or do anything. I am a 19 year old female living in NJ. I do not like parties etc. I do not want to go to school. I hate the state of the world and I tried to be that better person for it but it just does not work. Its becoming a drag. I love my boyfriend but I feel like I am becoming a nuisance to him. My insecurities are getting him annoyed I can tell and I do not know how to like myself anymore. I feel like an alien I do not even relate to how I look. I feel bipolar I instantly regret the things I saydo I feel like I have 20 different people inside me. I tell myself I want to do what is right the better thing but then I just do not. I was not like this before as I started to dive into occult amp the universe I lost my sense of selfreality etc. nobody around me seems to have it figured out either. It seems as though there is literally no point of existing. I have already left my body before amp I feel like I know what is on the other side. I am tired of making decisions like what to eat or what career to pick or how to pay bills or which doctor can fix my damaged toe. Etc.its just so much I have problems with. I have not one friend I have acquaintances who are fake . Please convince me to live I feel like I have a valid reason to kill myself,Suicidal
7957,7977,I am a minor with a mom who is fatphobic. I am being constantly told every couple of fucking hours how my thighs are too big always told that i look like i gave birth to 9 children. She constantly compares our arms and saying mine was bigger than hers. That i have too many stretch marks. She always tells me that when I am an adult I would thank her for all that she is saying and i would regret my body so much. She just told me i was gaining a flabby big lower belly and i should immediately exercise. My dad is a bit better but i think that is only because we do not talk much only a couple of times a week and 50 of our conversation is just him reminding me of how fat i am and how I would die of obesity. My sister tells me to 'just lose weight' as if i do not want to already. she is been skinny her whole life even when she eats even more than I do. It just feels like she is mocking me.I want to work on myself and i really do want to change. But i just want to lose weight when i am HAPPY when i can love myself for who i am where i do not need to wait for midnight to cry and vent mental breakdowns every night just so they cannot hear me. When I do not get anxiety every time i try to dress up because i feel like a whale trying to fit in barbie clothes.I am not even obese. I am just 10kg over the normal weight range for my age. And I feel like I can lose this weight when i try to. But I am just not in the right mindset right now. I cannot try and force myself to exercise without my self loathing getting even more intense when i see myself. I hope that people who says 'losing weight is easy if you just put your mind to it' sees this. I KNOW I am fat. I know i need to lose weight. I know myself and my body more than you do. I deal with more than just my weight. It comes with extreme self loathing anxiety and even depression. The mental burden we deal with cannot be easily cured by losing weight. So I do not need the constant reminder of how ugly and unhealthy my body looks because it just adds on to my existing selfhate. Family is the main reason i want to kms,Suicidal
21102,21122,i broke up with my girlfriend of almost eight months today. our anniversary would have been in two days and this time last year is the month that we met so we we have pretty much known each other for a whole year. i feel the worst fucking sack of shit alive. i cannot believe i actually did this. i always told her i would not leave her and i truly did not think i ever would i guess that is just what our relationship came to. we went days without talking so i assumed it was going to end in a breakup anyways so i started mentally preparing myself for it. then she said she wanted to fix things and that she would never give up on us. and i feel fucking horrible because i was all she had. she has no one irl that is there for her. her friends and family treat her like actual shit and I have never heard of anything so horrible. and all i had to do was be there and be her girlfriend but i failed. i deserve to die. I am ok with the breakup but the hardest part of this whole thing is she is suicidal. i know she will commit at some point whether i know or not and that is the most impossible feeling to live with. i do not know how I am going to carry on especially the next couple days i might as well just find a way to get rid of myself after this what the fuck have i done,Suicidal
7942,7962,I know exactly the day I am going to do it. There are several reasons why I have chosen this date. First my best friend of 12 years is getting married and I will be his best man in November. Second I want to see my family for Christmas one last time. I am going to drive myself somewhere relatively far and shoot myself in the head while in my car. I carry the suicide note I have already written in my wallet. I break down and cry every day. I think about dying almost every minute of the day. I do not sleep well I will not eat for days at a time. I have lost all motivation and hope for the future. I am 24 years old and I have no desire to continue to live. I am only afraid that I will end my life before this date. I have spoken with suicide hotline several times this month. Only to keep myself alive until the end of December. I think about my plan everyday and its the only kind of mental relief I feel. I hope to die leaving my loved ones with good memories of me. Its hard to fake being okay. I am only staying alive for them. Unfortunately they are not enough to keep me going. I am certain I will end my life. I am going to end my life in December.,Suicidal
24093,24113,I do not want to die honestly I am close to enjoying my life. But I cannot handle being the bad guy.I was fucked up and mentally unwell for years he wanted to stay but now he resents me and is abusive to me. I do my best to be impeccable with my word. To be kind validating supportive etc. He tells me I owe him a place to live while he tells me he does not owe me telling me what he is planning to do when he takes the car that day. I we live with my family. I am shamed by him about my toxic attachment with my narcissist grandma we live with.He calls me her pet and shames me for having a support system basically because when he leaves here he will have nothing and while my relationships with family are strained I have them.I was awful for years and if I do not do everything he wants now I will be cast as so evil and if I make him homeless before he has the money I will be damned basically to be considered awful and evil by him forever. Why do I care about what he thinks? Idk.But I am so depressed desperate and I cannot stand sleeping in the bed with him in a sexless trash abusive relationship any longer. Pretending to my family that things are fine because I will be the evil one if i use my family's help to make him leave. He will be homeless. he is getting settlement money in a few months but until then I try my best and am consistently told it is not enough. My relationship is truly ruined I do not even care anymore but he lives in my house and will not leave until he gets money in 3 months and we sleep in the bed together,Suicidal

10464,10484,This has been the worst fucking year of my life. Fucking 34 years on this planet and nothing takes the fucking cake like this. No friends to vent to anxiety rushing through my head ocd replaying the same fucking convos repeatedly. I cannot deal with all of this heartache. I lose my two year relationship. My family splits apart. Me and my girls rebuild. Meets another girl she breaks our heart. And yoyos it back and forth for months as we wait first one comes back and we give her a chance. She leaves us again. Second girl comes back and continues toying with being committed. I lose my shit and had enough of the games and leaves. Meet another woman she seems great but taken. Refuses to leave her dead end relationship for us and prefers to cheat. that is not for us. Meet another woman like her alot but we agree it would not work. Person we dated before wants to hang out nothing serious yay.... Met an amazing woman but she is not sure if she wants to be with us. Second girl comes back again. And says sorry. Then tonight confesses the guy friend I warned her about and she was foul for taking his number in the first place when she never took others which itself is a red flag well they while she is been gone for this month have been dating and making out etc. But yet confesses her love and wants to be with us. Says it is not a big deal but refuses to lose him. Yet says it is just fun while she is on her journey until she is ready to settle. I am not ok with that. Fuck that shit.My mother is possibly dying too.My girls are sick and struggling to support me emotionally. They are pretty much numb to all of this. They hide their feelings well. But I can tell their hurt also. Our son is sick.I am back to self harm.I am getting addicted to weed again as I self medicate daily to try and keep functioning.I am bursting at the seams and want to fucking die. I promised myself I would not get back to a suicidal place but yup I am here. Daddy's home. I swear I am going to fucking do it. I am so much over all of this pain and heartache. All of this grief and strife. I am done with it. I want to fucking jump in the river and drown. I cannot keep going another day like this. No friends to talk to no family to talk to and the girls cannot emotionally be there as they are not those types of individuals to know how to adequately be there for someone with my level of depression. Yay..I swear this is going to finally be it. I swear to fucking god imma do it.,Suicidal

20029,20049,I had a close friend who completely lost themselves and in the process completely shattered me. Every day they are turning more and more into a habitual liar and it feels like the part of my life I shared with them was completely falsified. it is because of this person that I began questioning just about every life decision I have made. I am in a very good position in life. I have a stable career. I have close supportive friends who truthfully are not aware that I have not been well I do not want to burden or concern anyone close to me with my problems. I have pets that love me unconditionally. Despite all of that I feel so alone. I feel like I am not working toward anything anymore. I wish I had a sign or a goal that could keep me going but I am not sure what those could even be at this point.Just so we are clear I have not selfharmed recently. The thought has been on my mind more and more every day though. Every day since around the start of April I have been spiraling more and more. Right now I just need some words of encouragement. I have not been well for a while. I have not had any major urges to selfharm since the end of 2018 but it is hitting me hard again.,Suicidal
8968,8988,I have rewritten this like 10 times because it feels like i cannot ever get the words right but i think i just need to post somethingI have lost the friendship i had with my best friend and i do not think it is ever really coming back. i have another friend who is helped me a lot through the last days while I have felt horrible but i can tell she is at the limit of her energy and i do not want to overwhelm her with more of my issues.i feel so lost and overwhelmed so anxious constantly. i have not been able to fall asleep for days the only time i get rest is when i pass out from exhaustion. I have been cutting myself every night to cope but the only way i can see myself truly getting peace of mind is to hang myself and it is getting really hard not to give in to the urge anxious for days and it is not getting better I am getting desperate,Suicidal

27015,27035,I am lonely. I know my current group of friends do not like being around me. Yet I am too socially inept and scared of finding a new group of people.

That has happened too many times for me to seek more people that I 100 will be gone in just a few months. it is painful. Title,Suicidal
17334,17354,i guess I am just failing at everything. i never wanted to tell anyone in the first place but i feel so awful and alone and the panic attacks keep coming anytime i let my mind wander too freely. i just thought maybe it would feel better to tell someone but they were too busy or did not understand my attempt at a serious conversation. i do not blame that person i know they are not heartless and would care if i could ever just find the words.

I attempted to tell my friend I attempted,Suicidal
8191,8211,It feels like everyone is always expecting me to have all of my problems listed out in a convenient list. I often struggle with getting my thoughts in order and as a result my sentences may sound incoherent. This makes it so much more difficult for me to reach out. Sometimes I do not want to reach out at all. My brain feels so scrambled all the time.I genuinely do not want to be alive anymore. Each passing day I get closer and closer to ending it all. I can never articulate my thoughts properly,Suicidal
9285,9305,I do not know where to askI've been struggling with suicide thoughts lately I get professional help so I am okay Yesterday when I was cleaning my apartment I found an note where I wrote about my suicide thoughts and an suicide letter to it as well. Somehow I got scared when I read it. I know it was my thoughts I wrote and I was in a very dark place when I wrote that. But it scared me somehow. I threw the note away and the letter. But I wonder is weird that I got scared when I read the note? Is this strange?,Suicidal
22120,22140,I know they have to report if you have a plan or thoughts about suicide but I just want to be honest and talk about them with someone who can help me. Yes suicide is awful but I want to talk to someone who can help me process the thoughts and find some kind of solution for these thoughts. But instead I do not open up all the way because I am afraid they will lock me up for a weekaway from my baby boyand charge me hundreds of dollars out the ass. I already went to the ER for a anxiety attack mental breakdown last monthand they treated me like I was a fucking inmate. They gave no shits and made it be known that they did not care. When ever I tried to say thank you to a nurse or talk to one of themthey would roll their eyes and ignore me. Just completely ignore anything I said or acknowledge me. So I do not want to go back to that place ever againbut I want to scream from the roof tops about how I want to jump from the same roof topbut fear having to be put awaybecause of these thoughts that they say are normalbut when I express these thoughtssome how they become not normal. I do not get it. I want to sit downlook my therapist in the eyesand tell them I want to jump in traffic without them reporting me and having me involuntarily hospitalized.,Suicidal

No one believes a word I say and I do not blame them. I am a liar because I am to afraid to be hated or not accepted.I wish for death to take me every hour an opportunity to sacrifice myself for good.

23834,23854,Everyone in my life always leaves me I never hold onto friendships and I am usually left to deal with everyone alone. At one point I got use to it and ok being alone but I had a relationship fail and It was mainly to do with her ex being closer to her and trying to get back with her then I was. I go to school and hang out with people but none of them know me and I do not have any actual friends. I talk to 1 person on a daily basis but I am too scared to admit that them because I do not want to be judged. The only time I have peace is when I am distracted but I have started thinking again about a bit more of permanent solution. I got out of suicidal thoughts and depression once but I am not sure I have it in me to do it again. I just want to give up and fade away. No one cares about me and I will not even be surprised if no one replies to this. I just do not see a point to life anymore,Suicidal

23263,23283,Being 'loved' or 'cared for' is just a giant sham. All that means is that people are going to manipulate you hurt you disappoint you trash you fuck you over and I cannot do it anymore. I do not want any friends not a boyfriend I just want to be totally alone. Everyone that claims to 'love me' just manipulates me and wants me to be their doormat to walk all over. An interaction with someone has a 5050 shot at making me feel totally either suicidal socially anxious or severely depressed. Rarely do I walk away from a social experience saying wow that was fun wow that made me feel great about myself! wow I feel so loved and appreciated. Ironically if I just set some boundaries and stand up for myself for once I am sure they will all just leave me on their own anyways. I do not want any kind of relationship anymore.,Suicidal

I am just tired. yesterday was really bad bc i started thinking about how there is no point in doing anything when I am just going to continue to be sad. i do not see the point in doing hobbies or watching things to cheer me up when I am just going to go right back to being depressed after its done.i have therapy i have meds I have been doing things that people have told me would help but nothings working. i think I am just one of those people where life is not for me.

I am not even sure if that is what these things are.i find no interest in the game I have recently been playing. like all of a sudden an off switch went in my brain and made me lose my love for it. all i want to do is sleep but i feel too restless to do so. death terrifies me. i pretend it does not but as soon as i think about the method to killing myself i tear up. shit sucks. what stings most is that i know i have it good my teacher even poked fun at me for it lol. i just hate what i feel a lot of the time.i wonder if I will ever get the balls to chug down a bunch of my mothers blood pressure tablets she mentioned once that if i took them I would have a heart attack.I have decided going by train is too scary. the way i decided that is by my friend shaming me about the fact i wanted a more gruesome method.I only ever wanted something more clean cut and gruesome because i heard once that while women try to kill themselves more than men men have a higher death rate because men usually choose shooting themselves in the head rather than an overdose.I am in my bedroom right now listening to the birds.

I probably will not even make it past my late 20s if i do not kill myself with alchohol and meds.

I have never had a girlfriend and will probably never find love which is pretty much all anyone needs. I am a virgin. I am ugly. I am broke. I have never even been called attractive by a woman and its starting to weigh really heavily on me that Ill probably never find a love. I am unloveable and unwanted and if this is all life has to offer me I am better off dead so people do not have to put up with me being sad and a waste of space all the time.

Anyhow I love you all and I hope you all find a way to affirm your life. I seriously amp legitimately empathize with you all on the most fundamental level.

23430,23450,My life has been rather difficult for the past 23 months now. I try to have joy when I can but as soon as I stop doing whatever or it does not go well enough or I cannot stop thinking about negative stuff my day gets ruined. Again and again.. I thought I was over it... I kind of was.. Last year life was great honestly.. But it was all escapism.. All I did was nutrition study language study food making exercise and sleep.. But then of course I got so many constant comments about my appearance how I was ugly that I looked like a guy and pointed and laughed at I just stopped going outside stop making varied delicious foods though still did the others for a bit.. But even that is gone this year.. Whenever I try to become stronger better version of myself more resilient kind fun.... I get met with so much constant push back it is getting exhausting.. and nobody understands.. I do not share much with my friends these days because it is just the same and so exhausting especially to be remembered myself about all of the negatives when I just am trying to be in the now and do what little I can to improve on myself..At this point however I am getting worried I guess.. I already attempted before.. One serious attempt and multiple smaller one which at most just gave me some temporary pain but had 1 chance of killing me really.... Why I am worried is that I actually feel it.. The temptation thoughts feelings about suicide becoming as strong as back when I had my serious attempt and I do not know how long I can go on without trying again.. Sadly there is no help for me.. I need money to fix myself... At least some minor surgeries to fix my flaws so I can look average at least and not harassed fearing leaving the door every time move out to a safe place instead of where I currently am which is also unsafe have money for more than basic needs unless I save up for 6 months at a time to splurge a bit on more fun stuff like clothes I need or maybe a new game and such.. Just living on food meds basic life necessities gets exhausting.I thankfully started seeing a psychologist last week so at least I got that finally after asking for years but it is like once a month kind of thing atm because it is a free offer and I cannot afford to pay for one myself.. I also am seeing if I am stronger than before to see if I can hold a job or study again since last I tried it went extremely bad and I broke down completely.. And that is with streaming.. It has a pressure like a job for me but it has been difficult.. though while it is extremely difficult to me it has also brought the most joy to me in a long while... I feel so conflicted. Especially since I am also here feeling the pressure and just not being able to handle it as much anymore.. It was the last thing I felt I could try. See if I could actually accomplish anything yet... I feel my friends and some followers just pitied me or were curious for a bit and now what.. I am too broken to become anything ever.. So why bother going on.. Especially since my entire life except for last year only year in my life where I actually felt happy has been overall terrible hard sad and filled with escapism.. If I did not have streamer subs and a friend coming over soon I dunno I feel I might have been gone already by now or tried to be.. Sigh... Thank you for reading.. Feeling like an ugly failure and that I am no good at life..,Suicidal
7162,7182,I posted on here before but it is just getting harder and harder. I definitely do not impact anyone's life in any way. I do not have any close friends. If I was ever in trouble I would not have anyone to call. I feel so worthless and gross and disgusting. I feel like everyone hates me and wishes they never met me.If I could leave this world and everyone could forget I ever existed I would. I wish everyone could forget me.,Suicidal
9901,9921,I cannot stop thinking about suicide. Everyday I wake up with more pain and emotional torture than the day before. I bought a gun the other day just to see if I would have the stones to pull the trigger. I just graduated college and I cannot find a fucking job. I majored in a boring same old subject that I figured would get me a job but do not really enjoy. I wanted to write movies and songs about life but I have no path to get there. I think that it is time for me to go. My family is the only thing that gives me pause. I cried as I pet my dog today but he was happy as could be. Sometimes I wish I was just a braindead idiot who could happiness in just simply existing. I figure I should write letters to my friends to let them know why and that they are better without me. I do not matter in the grand scheme of things so why stay here for people to bitch about politics all the time and argue over ridiculous stuff. I cannot find love and doubt I ever will no woman can love a man that hates himself and hates living. I have come to accept this. Nothing matters. I never did and never will. I cannot get out of this train of thought and I might succumb to it soon,Suicidal
7088,7108,HelloI have contact with an user on instagram that at some point explained that is planning to commit suicide. The person already tried it and is planning to do it again.I am not a professional and I do not think I can help as much as possible. Unfortunately the person does not have privacy and cannot call the suicide hotline I recommended would have consequences if so. I though an organisation or professional could help her through instagram and help. Do somebody have any Idea what can I do or who could I reach?Thanks Help through instagram,Suicidal

11431,11451,I feel strong hatred towards my body. The sensory issues of it are too much to handle. Some clothes help me temporarily cope but they just worsen the issues when I take them off. There is no permanent solution and I do not think I can learn to live with it. Its been almost six years and this body simply is not for me. I cannot change anything and I am aware this is as good as it gets for this thing but I cannot do this for the rest of my life. If it only gets worse from here on I do not know if I want to live to see it. Apologies for the ambiguity. I do not know how to spend the rest of my life in this body,Suicidal

My mom just says the N word to insult someone,Suicidal
19599,19619,What is a prison. A place where you are detained against your own will. What is life. A place that you end up by mystery and unable to leave. Leaving entails death by suicide. Fear of the unknown keeps you here in this prison. Life is not a gift is a fn curse. Every day is disappointing filled with evil. You have to constantly watch your back. Sound familiar?I am certainly hating life and wish this works would end. It will not. Never end on it is own. it is a prison and I am a prisoner. Wish I was dead How is life a gift? More like a prison.,Suicidal

I know its close to average but I cannot stand being the shortest anymore.I thought I got a hold of my depression and suicidal thoughts by working out and losing 57 lbs graduating college with a job lined up eating properly practicing mindfulness but none of it helps when I see them every day and cannot help thinking about my inferior genes. Why was it me that had to be the shortest? Why was it me that had to be the most dark skinned? Why was it me who got the most health issues? This is a cruel fucking world...

9716,9736,I suffer from both extreme anxiety and depression. Well this is one of those nights where I am having suicidal thoughts.ampx200BI am aware various hotlines exist to help. The problem is my extreme anxiety will not let me make use of any of them. I am so scared at the thought of talking to people over the phone. I am scared and anxious to even reach out to anyone for help. I am just going to get ignored? Maybe not but it is how I always feel. The horror stories that I have read about hotlines not picking up make it worse.ampx200BI constantly feel like I am a waste of space. I am 23 and cannot even do things for myself like make appointments because I have to talk to someone over the phone. Sometimes I feel like there is no path for me in life and that I should just end it. Anxiety suicidal thoughts is not a great combo.,Suicidal

He started to poke my belly fat proceeded to tell me I was still chubby. He pointed out my nose is crooked and that I should consider surgery. Why cannot I just be normal.I started to feel better about myself after losing weight. I did. And everything I felt insecure about came back just like that. I went on a walk last night. And I realised that it does not matter. Thick or thin. Make up no make up. Working hard hardly working. Poor rich. I am worthless. It does not matter what I do. What I look like.

24220,24240,An 18 year old man I have always felt different from others I never thought it would end this way I always considered that empathy was what allowed the existence of societies like the foundations of a building but every time I see less empathy in this world and I refuse to stay here to watch hundreds of thousands of years destroy itself in a moment this is even worse than it sounds as the only thing that got me out of the depression I was in before was my current therapist the only other homo sapiens that I could really refer to as human gave me a goal in life to be a great doctor and to be able to help people with my condition autism and perhaps with this to rekindle the flames of empathy and I accepted it and believed it and lived happily for several months until the actions of my parents and the world around me made me realize something for when I have influence in the world to save some empathy there will be no more nothing to save so besides constantly see the world be more and more decadent until its destruction I also discovered my goal in life only so that months later it proves impossible to me can you help me stop thinking like this?

And i really am left alone in this dark room in this empty house in this desert. In this coldness. Wish i was just a little luckier. Just a little. Is it too much to ask for. In this blank world in this retarded unkindness. It is hard to breath. But i think i have enough anger and hatred that would convince me to kms just to see those who annoyed me suffer. I imagine how others will feel after seeing their failiure. I think i understand how someone felt. Someone that killed themselve to just show others that they have failed. Yeah bye,Suicidal
25704,25724,I have this constant fear of danger. Wherever i am there is this feeling both looming over me and inside me if that makes sense. I have learned to live with the fear and at times I am grateful for it. Sometimes tho like if I am left alone for a while it can be so overwhelming i cannot sleep. Suicidal thoughts sometimes feel the same to me. There are times where i wake up and I am half conscious and the thing that is running through my brain in those times is my family crying over my suicide. Lately tho its been getting easier to listen to their cries. i have no clue how to breathe,Suicidal
19990,20010,I first noticed my desire to commit suicide in 3rd grade because my teachers has been severely bullying me name calling hair pulling shoving humiliation etc and nobody wanted to help me. Everybody knew and nobody wanted to help me. My parents said I was being dramatic and did not believe me so I just stopped telling them. Other staff members were complicit in it or joined in on the fun and all i could ever think was that I deserved to be sad because I was or and I deserved to die. Then it just continued like that for the rest of my life. Anytime I was sad it was because I deserved it. But the worst part is I never want to be alone. Everytime I get this way I reach out and almost BEG for help. From my parents teachers friends family anyone who is supposed to help me and the worst part is they do not listen. It feels like nobody cares because of how often this has been happening. I have been dealing with horrible depressive episodes disgusting methods of selfharm and days where I do not sleep or eat because I just want to kill myself since the 3rd fucking grade. I have been this was for almost the majority of my life now and nobody wants to help me because of how long its been. I am scared of myself. I am scared of how alone I am. I am scared of how long its been and how every single episode only gets worse. there is never a time where I feel like this episode was better than the last because it just feels like I am sinking deeper and getting closer and closer to the bottom. I am at a point now where every single problem feels like the end of the world. Even now my boyfriends been distant lately and every moment he is ignoring me just feels like its pushing me closer and closer to the edge. I have dropped food and spiraled downwards gotten a 99 instead of a 100 been in a room that is a little too loud been inable to order my favorite food etc the smallest shit and my mind forces me into this state. I have had it worse but it feels like my mind is just looking for any excuse for me to end it all. Nobody cares about this. My friends change the subject or demand I be better so we can hang out my parents think I am faking it for attention for almost a decade now my relatives do not give a shit about me either way. I cannot bring myself to tell my boyfriend about how bad it is. he is been so supportive of me in the past when I lightly touched on the subject but I cannot bring myself to be vulnerable with him if I am just scared he is going to leave and not care about me anymore or if I am scared I will just be a burden on him. I want to be better so badly. More than anything I want to just be okay and not feel so alone. I am terrified right now because if it keeps getting worse like this I do not know how much longer I will go on. I have dreams and goals. I want to go to college get married have children have a successful career in writing even normal everyday things like eating my favorite snack but its so hard to keep going like this. I just want to be happy. I want to feel loved like I was when I was younger. I do not want to feel alone anymore I just want to be okay. Its only getting worse.,Suicidal

16024,16044,I am luckier than most which is why I feel selfish. My home life fucking sucks but its not the worst and I have people who I know would be upset if I left. My little sister just slid a note under my door. Were not close but it fucking broke my heart. I was being screamed at by my parents again about how stupid and useless I am and she had to sit there and listen to the whole thing. The note says I love you and I am sorry I did not do something. Its her birthday on Wednesday. I want to leave so fucking badly but I do not want to ruin her special day. she is only turning 11 and I do not want to fuck her up for the rest of her life bc I was too selfish to stick around. I was going to kill myself on her last birthday but did not end up trying for the same reason. I know my friends would miss me as well and my boyfriend. I do not want to make anyone upset but I cannot keep doing this. I have no escape. I know I am going to kill myself eventually I have known since I was my sisters age that I am going to but I have just been too much of a pussy to actually do something about it and end my own suffering. I just do not see the point anymore. Life is a fucking meaningless cycle of pain and misery and I am so resentful to my parents for bringing me here and treating me like this only to force me into a life I never asked for or wanted. I am so so tired... I know people would miss me but I am just so tired.,Suicidal

It just seems so... easy? So inviting? I think about it all the time like after the hard part which depending on how you do it will be quick enough and after that it is just eternal rest. It sounds so nice. Screw my family getting sad or something I will not even be there to grieve about the sadness I caused them because I am 6 feet under. Honestly at this point I am so tired of keeping up with everything. I am tired of forcing myself to manage my emotions all the time. I forgot what it is like to not have to remind myself to keep a positive attitude. I forgot what it is like to actually .. have a purpose? To have something to look forward to in life?Really I am just going through the motions now and I am sick. I am so so sick and tired.

I have a cat who I love I have a few friends not many but the ones I have are good I have a sister who I can talk to but I still just cannot seem to maintain anything even remotely resembling happiness or order. For as long as I can remember I have been so up and down in terms of my mental health and it feels like mostly downs. I always get myself into this state where I am behind with work I am behind with things I need to do in my personal life I am neglecting my personal hygiene I let my colleagues and my boyfriend down I do not text my friends and family back I let them down by forgetting big events like birthdays. I am really struggling to understand what my purpose on this planet even is and what I can do to get to a place where I can feel like I am useful or like I am not just a burden. I have been so anxious lately that I have absolutely ruined the skin on my face and arms by relentlessly picking at it. I just want to switch off my brain and stop existing for a fixed period of time until I can come back and deal with my life and get my shit together. I wish there was a pause button but it feels like life is moving 10x faster than my brain and body are able to catch up with and I do not know how to function. What is wrong with me?,Suicidal

8612,8632,They do not understand I am depressed that I have been experiencing low moods because I had a traumatic experience. I promised myself I am going to be honest with my feelings and everything that I do but all I get is misunderstanding that I am crazy. I do not want to go to s psychiatrist not because I do not want to get healed but because my parents will think I am crazy and they will use that against me in my near future. I do not want to walk around and be known for having mental health issues and a degree again not because I do not to have one but because mental health is very stigmatized and looked down upon where I am.The thing here is that I want to go to a psychiatrist secretly in the near future but my mother keeps pestering me what is wrong talk to me etc. etc. I honestly believed her which is a dumb move to be honest so I opened up to her because you know I want to ease her mind and at the same time I want to let her see what I see. The former option was checked on her checklist but not the latter option. She saw what I see but she did not understand but instead she used it to increase her pride or ego told people without my consent I honestly believed and it should be that if there is anything private you should be honored that you out of all people are the one they tell it to so you do not say it and also take pride on it that way friendship is formed tell to my father whom I hate for reasons I am not telling and tell to everyone who is not at all understanding.

I guess I just want to die I am not wanted I am not needed and worst of all I am not loved. No matter what I do I lose. I cannot handle all of this anymore I want to die. I truly feel that the world would be a better place without me in it. My kids and him deserve better than I could ever hope to be. I am such a fucking failure I want to die. To get up every day knowing that no one on this earth wants you around or alive is fucking soul crushing. I have been cutting lately because of how I feel people do not love me or care about me so why should I maintain self harm sobriety? No one cares if I cut myself. No one. Not even him. At this point I do not know what is stopping me from taking my own life... God I want to fucking die. I want to die,Suicidal

25052,25072,I believe that if you end suffering for yourself assuming you succeed you will start it for your parents. If your parents have helped you or supported you in any way throughout life do not do that to them while they are still alive.you would be creating a world of pain for people who truly do not deserve it. Personally its what is holding me back. For about 25 years.yeah.How many of you feel this way? Those of you with living parents are they what is keeping you from ending it?,Suicidal

23254,23274,My friend has been struggling with some suicidal thoughts. Her family has been putting so much pressure on her and her other friends are being absolute assholes. she is this really happy and nice girl. Would always help everyone. But she is really struggling with her studies and her family only puts pressure on her until she has these thoughts. She the other day had a small fight with her dad while studying and she came to me and her other friend for comfort. She kept on saying how she wants to kms and that she could not take it anymore and her friend just went Oh well you will go to hell so do not do that maybe??? Should I have said something back then? Was the other friend in the wrong? Suicidal Friend,Suicidal

I do not believe in souls or heaven so they were never a person but fucking what luck that fetus had to die before entering this shitty world. I wish it had been the other way around.

13053,13073,I am 48 with a 5 year old daughter. I have a good job and a house but I have a wife who no longer has any interest in me. She went through post partum depression after our daughter was born and I did not know how to handle it. She was critical mean and so defensive about talking about it. I tried to give her space which eventually led to cheating me. We are trying to work it out with therapy but she does not seem to be sorry for anything and blames me and her history of abuse not from me.I feel we are headed for divorce. She has said before she will take me for everythingshe can despite the fact that I primarily care for our daughter do all the cooking and cleaning and pay all the bills what she makes is her money. She contributes very little to the household except for making sure the TV gets watched all day. I have sacrificed 5 years in a loveless marriage and I am tired. I have no friends anymore because I cannot commit to anything trying to keep the household together.If she takes my daughter I have nothing left. I just do not want to go on after that and try to rebuild my life. I know it is selfish but I feel hopeless. I have no desire being an every other weekend dad. I just want someway to die so that I can leave everything to my daughter. I have tried to figure out how to stage it as an accident so my daughter can get my life insurance but it seems impossible. do not Want To Start Over,Suicidal

24179,24199,I am not even very sad my life is fairly easy etc. I was worse a few months ago but its slowly improved. Yet I want to kill myself more than ever. I am clinging onto absolutely nothing by even being here if anything I am a burden. Find a meaning then... yeah right. I have got many hobbies and stuff but they are not worth it ...and I am slowly getting worse at them. I enjoy them a little but its a distraction from the nothingness combined with me telling myself I should be doing something I never get genuine happiness out of these things. I want to cry from frustration but as I said I am not even very sad I cannot. I wish I was normal and meant something to someone and was not the fucking failure I am right now complaining on reddit.

26149,26169,I guess I should preface this by saying that talking does not work. I am too damned stubborn in my baseless negative thoughts and I do not want to burden my mom by telling her about anything so she can get me to a therapist. With that out of the way I guess Ill just list all my mistakes that have led me here.1. I do well in school but not well enough to go to a good college. No good college no good job shame for the rest of my life while my older sister flourishes.2. I fear I am going to end up like my deadbeat dad. Id rather die than leech off of others like he does.3. I am just not a good person. I am a downer I do not have anything useful to offer anyone and I am entirely replaceable.4. my grandma just died 2 days ago and my grandpa probably is not too far behind. that is probably the only thing that is slightly out of my control though I did not spend as much time as I should have with them.But I suppose I cannot complain. Many more people have suffered much worse and still loved life. I am just a useless coward. I am giving up. A hydrocodone overdose is looking really tempting right now. Ill just tell my stupid little story and try to properly plan my death on my own time.,Suicidal
9316,9336,Despite being 100 pounds overweight Id always held out hope I could eventually straighten that out. Plenty of folks have done it before it is something that seems achievable.Even though I have been stuck one class away from a degree I have always believed I could eventually get it. it is just one class. Just because I have failed it twice before does not mean it would be forever.But socially I am just stuck.I have no hobbies. I have no interests. I have nothing with which I can start conversations with others much less sustain them.And what hurts is that I just cannot make friends. I always feel like I am helping others but then I am told it is just annoying. Not necessarily UNhelpful. Just annoying. I know others struggle with this and I know my friends are not just being assholes or anything but I can never seem to find that line. I want to be helpful since it is my only potential asset towards a human relationship but I do not think Ill ever be able to do it in a way that is meaningful to anyone.that is just todays episode though.I just do not feel like Ill ever understand social nuance. I am probably on the spectrum somewhere but not enough so in order to be diagnosed. I just hate it. I hate being so trapped mentally.I want to go away so that Ill never again be a burden to the people I care about. Well one last time but whatever. I do not feel like I can ever overcome my social ineptitude.,Suicidal
15780,15800,A few minutes ago I realized that my friendship with someone that I once thought of as the best friend I ever had was over. I unadded her on everything. Its my fault the friendship ended I got into one of these moods and pushed her away. I thought she was better off without me. I am an ass I know. My summer job just ended. I felt good at it and now I am back to how I felt before. Empty tired. No matter what I always end up back here. Thinking about the bottle of sleeping pills I have hidden in my room if I get to low.

10489,10509,I was always a good person. I never did anything wrong. Always was the nerd in class good grades and all. My family had money great life future was bright. Well I could not find a job after I graduated even with all my good grades and all the courses I did in my life. I am a lawyer compliance analyst in Brazil. With specialization and all. But the country is in shit. that is not the only problem though. it is been more than 5 years that I graduated. I was not able to find anything. And... 5 years ago my world my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Now she is in really bad shape. My father is nuts angry about everything he sees and my sister is crazy literally diagnosed with a lot of mental problems and have a lot of of problems with drugs. I do not even drink alcohol. Never did. I have a great girlfriend that I love a lot. But I do not see a future for me. Not here. Not this way. And I cannot make myself change this situation. it is dawn hard and there is not much I could do. So I decided to kill myself after my mother dies and that will be it. I think it will be better for everyone. I do not want my other sister spending her hard earned money keeping me alive or to live in this empty house with my dad screaming at everything. Why is it so hard to find a job? I worked in my curriculum in my entire life for nothing because I do not have contacts. No one wants to hire a guy without experience with my age 27. And seriously I do not want to live a life in this country they pay you 1100 reais per month for a 10 hours per day job or more it is never 8 hours. And you cannot buy shit. A new car is 45000 reais. 600 reais for month just to eat basic things. 5000 reais a PS5. Dude this is not a life. it is slavery. You literally work sleep and work again. Eating badly not having time to do shit. Why would someone spend a life like that? that is no life. But what else could I do? I thought about going to Canada start again there but do what? I do not know! Well... Sorry about telling you all this. it is just a hard situation that I do not see a happy ending. I decided to kill myself and I need someone to change my mind.,Suicidal

17361,17381,I do not think I could stand anymore pain in this life but I feel too guilty to kill myself. However I do not see the good in me a human being who just becomes more and more numb and callous to survive. I cannot even love people properly anymore and feel rather indifferent to most things. I often find myself thinking I knew I should have ended it back then whenever I try and get better and its always so pointless. No matter what I do to avoid being selfish or manipulative or hurtful I always end up messing up in a different way. I am so tired but I am trapped in this cage anyway. The point,Suicidal
13218,13238,Hi there I sincerely do not know how to start or why I am even posting this I do not want to encourage anyone or to seek attention. But I guess I need to share it. As I said in the tittle I planned a date to kill myself. After my 24 birthday in 1 month and a half from now if my situation does not change drastically which I do not think it will I am going to do it. I already have all the necessary materials and planned it perfectly to be 100 lethal I do not want to end up paralyzed or to suffer. As for the reasons I am doing it... I will not explain them all because I feel absolutely pathetic and ashamed they are rationally speaking trivial for fuck shake my psychiatrist even diagnosed me with ptsd for something people do it everyday everywhere without a lot of drama. I feel like I am just the garbage of the society and I cannot improve that. I do not know since when exactly but I have been fighting against myself sabotaging everything I try to do and I am just too tired to keep fighting. I just stopped taking my antidepressants because I just do not want to feel apathetic I want to feel as I truly feel miserable. it is not some temporary problem. I have been sabotaging myself for too many years. The only reason I had to keep living now is fading and they are my parents which think I am just doing all wrong because I am lazy and they just decided my to kick me out of their house. When I hint them what I want to do they just think I am seeking attention. I truly think they want the best for me it is just that they are pushing me to the edge even more... I have always been a very rational person and that is why this stresses me out even more I cannot explain why these seemingly trivial things can lead me to this decision and why I kept sabotaging myself for years. It may sound cliche but I do not want to die it may be my survival instinct kicking in I even still enjoy some things in life but the pain its just unbearable sometimes its stronger than any physical pain I have experienced before. I truly do not want to do it because I feel extremely selfish and I fear that my mom would do it after me... I just hope that she can cope with the pain... After writting this I feel even worse I am a piece of shit and there is no right way to fix it. I just do not want to hurt anyone except me.Its not my first attempt there has been 2 before both of them I ended up in the hospital but the second time 15 years old I ended up locked in the mental health unit. I just spent 1 day there It was so terryfing that I avoided taking the medicine they gave me and escaped yeah I know that sounds... Extrange you may or may not believe it... But I did it they called me from the hospital but I guess they did not want to involve in legal procedures. In summary I do not truly talk to my psychiatrist about my real feelings about my suicidal thoughts for fear that I would end up there again. I do not want to listen empty phrases like all its going to be fine or this is just temporary I just do not want to keep suffering and I do not want to hurt anybody in the process. I am weak... I do not know what else to say if you read it all sorry for making you lose time of your life doing it. Planned a date to do it,Suicidal
7753,7773,Hey guys I am new here so I really do not know what I should talk about. I am 19 years old and I am suicidal. Every night I try to kill myself but end up failing badly that which frustrates me. Yesterday was the day that it finally dawned upon me that I wanted to end it all. I have never had anyone to get me through this except for myself and my bipolar disorder. Not even my family try or reach out to me so I am hoping to get good advice here on Reddit. Well mainly because it is my Dad causing these suicidal tendencies. I cannot even do the things I love anymore. I cannot even enjoy one of my games properly because of these thoughts of feeling utterly useless. I hope this reaches out the people that can help me. Because I truly am suffering. 19 years Old Suicidal,Suicidal
7336,7356,I have made the decision that I am not going to be sucked into the capitalistic hierarchical classist corpratociratic machine that entraps the world by whatever means necessary there is little joy to be gained from life and anyone with half a braincell can tell you it its only going to get worse from here and that any sort of major societal revolution is never going to come and any hopes of a world where humanity is free from itself have been dead for generations. Footnote I just realized I sound so much like a Marxist lol I have made a decision,Suicidal
23562,23582,I do not want to exist on this earth anymore but am too afraid to kill myself for a few reasons1 I do not want it to be a failed suicide which it most likely would be. I do not think I need to elaborate on this for obvious reasons.2 It will probably kill my parents and grandmother as my sister passed away a couple years ago already.3 I do not want to leave my dog with someone else do not judge me.I know people will say that I am afraid to commit suicide because I actually want to live but that is not true. I just do not want to actually kill myself. I would much rather a freak accident occur that takes my life where it is the other person's fault but they were in the wrong I.e. I could never jump in front of a traintruck because I would never want to traumatize the person driving or anything like that but a drunk driver would deserve it. Does this make sense to anyone? I feel so strange all the time having these thoughts. do not want to live but too afraid to kill myself.,Suicidal
10853,10873,Just do not really have the energy tonight to write my note film the video dress nicely and send personalized goodbyes to my friends .Like I have got the whole shabang written down step by step even picked out a bridge just need to find the motivation time and resources to check things off the list up until the grand finale.

26003,26023,I am still here bc some people want me to be here. But they will not do shit to help. Just expect me to be alive and suddenly be well. They took away my copying mechanisms and left and when I feel like I am falling into the dark pit they just ignore me until I am fine again. Bc nobody wants to fucking deal with me they just want me to be around bc I do not fucking know why. Bc its morally wrong to not care? Idfk I have been attending therapy for half a year and nothing fucking changed. Its even worse. Everyday is an emotional roller coaster of negative emotions and just cannot take it anymore. I am tired I am so exhausted. This night is so exhausting I just want to kill myself so bad and stop this sinking feeling. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. I live for others not for myself and I fucking hate it,Suicidal
26104,26124,it is been pretty obvious for a year or so about where I am headed. I never chose to discipline myself I never chose to succeed academically in high school where I am currently at as a junior since I have never really put in any significant effort into my courses and ultimately I have come to terms with failing in life and living in absolute shambles like taking up some deadend job like McDonald's or Applebee's for the rest of my life with a wage that barely supports myself. I have also happened to act like a massive dick to my parents and my older sister both of which have endlessly nagged and lectured me whilst pushing me into opportunities such as tutoring for improving my grades and some math contests at a university I live close to. I do not think they will regret seeing me go after countless shouting matches fistfights and instances of broken furniture all of which are a product of my uncontrollable fits of rage stemming from my recklessness hatred and ignorance towards them. I truly think that while they still try to made amends for myself by lecturing me and giving me chances to improve my prospects for my future they really should not care about this little piece of 16 yearold privileged shit anymore because I just will not listen. Everything I have done in my life whether it be positive if there is any I could genuinely think of or negative there is plenty that I could think of here is the result of my own actions where I have continuously failed to realize the consequences of my own actions. that is all I have to say. I am thinking of just laying on my bed until I starve or die of thirst in a few weeks or so. Or maybe slumbering into a deep sleep and never bothering to wake up again. I have not put much thought in that department since I have also never really thought of where I might be in 2030 years. P.S. I could have added Nobody needs to care about me to this post. You can interpret this post as if it also had this meaning. Might as well call it quits. Nobody needs to care about me or feel pity for me.,Suicidal
21136,21156,A month ago I got dumped by a girl whom I thought was the one. I cannot convince myself things are going to get better. This is the final nail in my coffin after a history of heartbreak and depression. I never have any control over why my relationships end. They just end and I am never prepared for it. This weekend I started having my first panic attacks in a long time and they are worse than ever before. They last so long now. I know I am happiest when I am in a relationship and that definitely is not healthy. But it seems like my default mood when I am alone is depressed. For the past decade I have gone in and out of feeling amazing and feeling the worst pain I know. I cannot do it anymore. I cannot see myself with a family in the future. I have too many trust issues and I do not know if I will be willing to open up again if I ever meet someone new.Are my emotions even valid? I just cannot get her out of my head this time and I want to end it all. Today I walked past a parking lot and stopped because I considered going to the top and throwing myself off. I am swelling with emotion and it is getting harder to hold it in.,Suicidal
21913,21933,People always say that things will get better and that good things will happen if you just keep on living. I think they are lying for about the last 2 or 3 year my mental health has declined every day. I really want to believe that things will get better but I just cannot. Just be honest and say that life goes downhill after you turn 23.Another thing I find irritating is how people respond to a person killing themselves it is always what could we have done to prevent this? I do not know have that talk about suicide before someone kills themselves. it is like going to a burning house 10 hours after the fire stopped just to pour one bucket of water on it and thinking that it is going to help.If you are reading this line I want to thank you for listening to a 17yearold guy rant about not wanting to live. When does the pain end?,Suicidal
23305,23325,she is still gone I know she is never coming back but I will always wist for her. Life is not worth it without her. Everyone keeps telling me I need to move on and help myself. But I cannot. I have fucking tried and everyone does not listen. Nobody knows what the fuck they are talking about. I am alone and she is never going to comeback. Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself? it is perfectly reasonable. People like me are just fundamentally wrong and cannot be helped. I am a dependent person. I need her and she needs to be alone. So that means I need to die because it is better than living in pain. I do not know what to do. And everybody keeps telling me to do things I cannot do. So I am fucked. it is been over a month and it is worse,Suicidal
7682,7702,But would you want to face the possibility of finding yourself in a world like this one and go through hell again? Face your demons here friends. To live is to suffer but do not worry death never misses. When its your time its your time. It might seem long but its not millions of years have passed and trillions of plants animals and humans have already died. Hell 20 years ago for me seemed like yesterday. Do whatever feels right for you seriously fuck what society or anyone else thinks. Do whatever you want except taking the life out of yourself. Death itself will take care of that for you it always does with 101 accuracy. You might think you are already dead inside but are not well all? Its either that or were numb from pleasure. Let yourself be a goddamn mess because damn madness is beautiful and we all know we need a littlea lot more crazy in this world. You do not want to be here in this hell,Suicidal

It did not matter how many Xanax I took right now I still cannot sleep and I have to stay aware of how horrible a person I am and how better Id be if I was dead. I cannot self harm because I promised my family I would not. I am stuck. I just do not want to be here I do not know what I want. But I know I deserve death.,Suicidal

25703,25723,So they tell you to talk to someone about it and when you do they just flip their shit and act like you are saying it to manipulate them or for attention. How are you supposed to get help if you are just going to be judged labelled as toxic and abandoned by everyone just so some narcissist can play victim and tell everyone how hard it is to have a relationship withnot deal with a suicidal person. it is like they love being an expert tourist guide on the subject until it is actually real and then it is shaming time. If anyone reading this ever has to talk to a suicidal person do not try to prematurely shame them for being selfish if they are still here. Having suicidal thoughts means you are toxic,Suicidal
20020,20040,I am not strong enough. I am not strong enough for this life. My entire existance has been reduced to coping with my mental problems. When I think about how many years I have left in this life....how much more pain I have left to experience....i know I will never find joy. I will never find a reason why it is worth it to go on.How can I say never? do not our feelings always change with time? I wish I could say so but I know better. I have seen the people who never get better. Who end up alone and miserable into their 40s and 50s their lives wasted. And I have seen it for myself in a vision. It never ends. I am trapped again. I cannot move in with him. I cannot spend day after day wishing I was someone else somewhere else anywhere else. I cannot stand having yet another conversation about breaking up abput how he is done nothing wrong and it is just my head. he will never see that I will never ever believe anybody could love me. That I will always envision him with other women happier and no longer obliged to deal with my shit. When we met I was a different person. I do not know what I am now. I do not know what to do. I have thought about running away and the only reason why I do not is because I have too much expensive equiptment at my house I would have to abandon. But even if I did run away....where would I go? And I have to take mtself with me. I will just have the same problems over and over. There is not any escape. I am not strong enough. The only advice I ever get is life is what you make it and I hate hate hate hearing that. Because they are right. I am a loser. I was born a loser and I will live a loser and I will die a loser and I know it is true because I have seen it. Death is the best thing to hope for. it is the eternal sollution. Why there is no way out,Suicidal

Just for me to talk to so I can feel maybe a little bit better even if it is only for a few minutes I have so much I want to do in my life but I am so tired of everything. I hate leaving the house it just feels like everyone is judging me when I walk by. I do not even care if anyone sees this or not I just wanted to write my thoughts. Thanks if you did read it anyway bye. I hate it,Suicidal
16413,16433,I cannot imagine how anyone could want to be in a relationship with me. I am an ugly 23 year old virgin who is never had a job has no friends or social skills and to make it even worse I am a trans woman. How could anyone love me when I cannot even love myself?,Suicidal
16065,16085,Is it weird that music stops me from ending it all? it is the only thing that still keeps me here. Even though in the end it is really pointless. I have been a singer songwriter for 8 years and it is the only thing keeping me alive besides my dad. Even so I am not happy. I was but my world came crashing down this year hard as fuck. My mother died and my girlfriend of 4 years left me within the span of one week. LOL life is a sick joke. I still have not decided whether or not I am going to stay here or not it depends on multiple things. To be honest I am just tired. I wonder if there is a God looking down upon me? I wonder if he hears my prayers? I only have so little left to hold onto. Music keeps me from ending it all,Suicidal
8177,8197,I put this together while sobbing so hard I almost made myself vomit last night. I had a pounding headache had to hold my breath so my parents would not hear me crying.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. The lain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. It reads.Dear KI wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that would not make you happy. So I have to let you be happy. That is what I want because I love you so much. I wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you. When I was young I learned the word for always in French toujours. It always sounded like a beautiful graceful yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy sentimental but genuine and strong. you will always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. you will always be in my heart. I promise. I love you so much. I have written a few different suicide notes to I am going to send people when I do it. This is the one that is going to the girl I am in love with.,Suicidal

20691,20711,My wife who I love so unconditionally snapped I think because of COVID and left and has refused to talk at all and has practically ghosted and blocked me and our entire relationship in a couple of days. I have so much emotional baggage and love for this person now I am all alone and do not want to continue this existence anymore. Heavily thinking of ending it all,Suicidal
17679,17699,I tried expressing my feelings today its my birthday and some things my family did made me feel irrelevant and i feel like i just ruined it for everyone and should have just kept my mouth shut. I cannot ever do anything right. If i keep the thoughts in they eat at me and if i express them it turns on me. I am tired of not being able to ever just breathe. Why do i feel like such a burden?,Suicidal
17422,17442,My parents really want me to go to college but mentally I am not ready yet. My entire high school experience was hell. I tried to kms every year I have been in the mental hospital 3 times. I barely graduated because I was always in the hospital and missed months of school because I was not able to find enough strength to do anything. I do not want to go away to a foreign environment and still struggle with depression and anxiety. Just in this case it will be intensified. Even now I have suicidal thoughts to want to kms literally every single day. There is not a day when I am happy. I do not know what to do anymore every time I think of college I want to jump off a cliff its extreme ik but honestly I do not know what to do. I do not want to be a adult and I did not ask to be here. Its so frustratingI hate it so much. I hate feeling pressured,Suicidal
24925,24945,I am think I have had it pretty good actually. Nothing seriously terrible has happened to me so far except for maybe one. I have seriously fucked up several times this year unknowingly before it was too late. I cannot get over it even though I have been told I have come a long way from being that version of me that was constantly fucking up. And everyone around me is suffering so much and they have real problems to deal with. I get really stuck on that for some reason I feel like its pathetic that I am so absorbed by misery every single day and not a more happy and successful version of myself. I cannot look at myself in the mirror and say yes this is a real valuable person I like. I cannot seem to see myself other than this hollow spoiled she will of a being whether I am or not. At this point my physical health is starting to slip a bit I have been drinking more but not eating or sleeping very well. I am not sure where to go. I just do not want to be here I want to be gone. I am sorry if this is incoherent I am a little out of it at the moment. Its getting to be too much I have been contemplating ending it.,Suicidal

21428,21448,I am drunk again. I have only been drinking for a week. I used to run and I currently do crossfit but this pandemic has me fucked on top of my regular fucked life. All I think of is killing myself. I got my vaccination yesterday and all I kept thinking is why am I doing this? I will probably be dead soon anyway. I have literally nothing to live for. My family is shit. I got kicked out of the doctorate program I was doing because I freaking freaked out during the pandemic. I tried to get into that program for 3 years and then in just a day it was all over. I have tried for so long to overcome my abusive past and I have just never been able to overcome it. I cannot make friends I guess because once I started to trust people someone I considered a friend raped me...so here I am. An American in Spain just existing. I am in therapy but it is not enough. I am too damaged. I am really fucked up. I think I am a nice person. I am sensitive to others I want to help others but here I am drunk again because I cannot deal with myself. I do not know what I am trying to do here by typing here but I guess I am asking for help. I feel myself teetering on the edge of sanity. I am 40 years old this year. it is a big year and everyone important in my life ignored it. I am slowly making suicide acceptable. Help I guess?,Suicidal
16240,16260,I cannot tag it NSFW for some stupid reason. This is all have. I hope this is okay. I want to cut myself so bad. I want to stab my eye. I want cut my arms up. I want to cut off my penis. I want to feel pain. I feel like I am falling back into how I felt a few months ago. I want other things more than I want to die but death is so much easier. I would not fail to kill myself if I tried. I can easily kill myself. Its tempting. Nobody can stop me. I want to fucking burn. NSFW I feel bad,Suicidal
22363,22383,I have zero interest in wanting to live. Nothing appeals to me in life and all I can really see is me killing myself in the future. I am taking it as a matter of fact because I cannot see what else there is for me.I do not want to fall in love I do not want to get a job I do not want to have a family I do not want to hang out with anyone. I do not get any pleasure from anything except sitting on my ass all day and even then I am bored all the time.I do not know if I am even explaining myself correctly. I wish I was never born so I could save my parents the pain of losing their only kid.I know I am going to off myself one day. I said to myself I will do it this year for sure for the past 4 years. Time is going faster and faster and sooner than later I am going to finish year 12 and I will be floating around the real world without a clue and with no direction. I told myself I have to do it before school ends but as the day grows nearer it is getting overwhelming. I am probably not going to even do it because it is such a life changing decision. Life changing for sure! I will not even have a life after I make the decision. I do not want to experience life,Suicidal

I left work early a few days ago and I have been in my room ever since. I have not eaten or drank anything but a few goldfish crackers and the water that was on my Bedside table. I have no drive to do anything at all. I take sleeping pills the second I wake up so that I can just sleep. I cannot stop thinking about how much i fucking hate everything about myself. I do not even know why I am writing this right now. I just hate everything about my life. I do not think I will ever be able to find someone who I can be with and if I cannot experience life with someone I love then I do not want to experience it at all. I feel like I am at the end. I do not even want try and meet anyone anymore. I just want to lay in my bed and sleep until I do not wake up. I thought about checking myself into a hospital but after reading about how badly suicidal patients are often treated in the you.S I will no longer be doing that.

19060,19080,I have already made a post in the past but accidently deleted it So I am a 15 year old about to break up from school for the summer so I should be happy right? Wrong. My entire life I have felt like the world just hates me. My dad died of a cocaine overdose when I was 4. My mums alcohol dependent. My family struggles to afford food and rent. I am worried to be outside with my 13 year old sister because I do not want to look like a pedo. The reason why I think this is because I am mixedrace my dad was white British and my mums black Jamaican and me and my sister look very different from each other I am quite pale and white but my sisters black and I often get people staring at us when were out in public. I also have the very disturbing worry that in the future my sister might get sexually assaultedraped. I get bullied at school for being an awkward mess and people go out of their way to make me look even more stupid than I already do. I self harm myself by getting any sharp object I can get hold of and lightly cut my arm. I do not want to kill myself I just do not want to exist. Thank you for your time Pls help,Suicidal

12881,12901,Made a post here 10 months ago now kind of crazy about feeling suicidal or whatever. I ended up staying at a ward for a bit and for like 7 months I was doing pretty good managed to make it through high school and had a lot of personal achievements. But not only has it all amounted to nothing but I am in an even worse position than beforeAt least before if I had killed myself it would not have mattered because there was not much at stake. But now there is a few people in my life that I know would be devastated and my family would suffer a lot financially. I just want to die I have finally learned that it never gets better and this is going to be the rest of my life until I finally kill myself and honestly I just want to get it over withI do not want to spend thousands of dollars to simply attempt to get better just to fall back down again. it is all so fucking pointless maybe some people are not destined to live fulfilling lives It literally never ends,Suicidal

8732,8752,I will try to keep my story short but I am also venting.My partner has suffered from depression for most of her life. She has endured child sexual abuse and never healed and every time she got hurt throughout her life it just deepend that wound and reinforced the idea in her mind that people are abusive and out to hurt each other.Because of certain events her depression has gotten worse throughout our relationship. At first it was anxiety attacks or perhaps she hid the other stuff from me then. Now I can see she is worse than ever after a relative died. She feels she is a burden to everyone and mostly she feels there is no hope that she has been suffering like this for decades and that there is no hope for her to ever get better and live a normal life.Her average day is being constantly on edge and scared of everything. I can see in her eyes she is just exhausted. Some days she just lies in bed stiff as a board just looking at the ceiling and crying repeating I do not want this anymore over and over softly.Recently talks of ending it have become somewhat frequent. I cannot force her to go to a health clinic and I am in that situation where if I call them to pick her up she will not trust me again or experience it as another betrayal. In the end they will release her within a week or two and it all starts again but then I will not be near to support her and that might be more dangerous.The other side of the coin is that I am also just a human. I am overworked I get tired I get annoyed sometimes. it is a lot to carry for me and I realize I am just not everything a person with severe depression could need. I am not always soft and understanding I am not always right there to hold her hand. I feel for her and this situation is in my head all day every day but selfish as it is I am also at that age where people generally go through a lot of big milestones and I have plans and goals for the future and they are all on hold. Even though her safety is more important right now I do feel frustrated because it feels like my life is so uncertain and stagnant.I just do not know what to do or how to deal with this situation.I do not know if I am even a good thing for her. Sure I comfort her when she has anxiety attacks and I do what I can to be supportive. But the very fact that we have a relationship is also putting pressure on her. She feels like she is not a good partner like she is withholding sex from me. Like she is taking away my chance at a good future. Even though I try to tell her that is not the case she still feels like that. The sex is a nonissue. She is not a bad partner because she is going through depression I can live with all that. Underneath she is an amazing person that I love to spend time with. But she is right about the other thing I suppose. What if her depression never ends? What if truly she cannot ever overcome it and live a somewhat normal life. Am I a horrible person for not being able to see that in my future? I have had that feeling for months now. I do not tell her any of this because that is not something she should carry now. I am kind of just waiting it out and trying to have a good relationship and hoping that she does get better at least to some degree so that those feelings end up irrelevant.I have so many emotions and most of them conflict some way or another. I do not know what to do anymore. How to care for someone on the edge?,Suicidal
23593,23613,I told her that id only be with her still if i could cheat and fuck someone else 1 time as well but she said no please do not and that will she will let me have a threesome with her and another girl right now at the moment she is in the psyche ward for trying to kill herself and idk what i should do I have been having suicidal thoughts since monday and have been contemplating taking my life either today or tomorrow i feel so hurt and betrayed by the only person who is been there for me she told me its because i made mistakes too by not listening enough but i did listen i tried my hardest to I am 19 and this girl is 17 our birthdays are 3 days apart december 28th and dec 31st idk if if its a immaturity thing or not but all i kno this girl helped me with so much and vice versa and i feel like i cannot be here without her i just want to know is it possible to fix our relationship?

26978,26998,I was doing alright when I woke up. I had lunch with my family and we watched a movie that was dealing with some pretty heavy stuff chronic debilitating illness and lots of hospital scenes. I am a crier when it comes to emotional movies but today it just struck a chord in me and all of that despair sadness and hopelessness came rushing to the surface. I am just having such a hard time lately and I just keep getting so overwhelmed.I do not know how to just keep doing this for the rest of my life. I have been depressed and suicidal for almost as long as I can remember. I am 21 now almost 22. Sometimes med combostherapy have helped a little. but due to misc. life stuff I have always ended up not keeping up with it like I should have. Even then it still felt like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound. I have been hospitalized a few times too. It always seems like I just end up getting bad again. My family told me that I need to get help and that they love me and will do anything to help me. But for some reason that just made me feel 10x worse. I feel like nobody is really realizing the gravity of my feelings. I feel like I should not say my emotions are important or that they matter because they do not. But they exist unfortunately and are incredibly strong and hard to deal with.I just want to die. I just want to stop. I do not want to do anything at all. I just want to be alone and waste away and stop bothering everyone. Really struggling today.,Suicidal
16486,16506,it is absolutely ruined my mental state and my entire year of 2021 so far. I got scared after the crash and did not stick to the whole hold mentality realized I should have sold when they removed the ability to buy but I am a fucking idiot. Then I watched it go back up afterwards and ever since I have been trying to replicate it because it was the most money I had ever seen. I work an overnight job and every morning I agonize over the premarket of other stocks I have purchased and for the most part only see red I have now lost 11k. it is killing me mentally and physically. There is so much shame and regret that I cannot take it. It absolutely would have changed my life. I would have been able to afford to move out finish my nursing degree and actually feel like an independent adult for once. Instead I am stuck working a job a hate living in my childhood home with no friends or girlfriend. I have not been able to focus on or enjoy anything ever since. it is all about how much money I do not have that I could have if I was not so stupid. Everyday I think about dying because it feels like it was my last shot. I always fuck everything up. It all does not seem real. I still cannot handle giving up the opportunity to make 50k off GameStop back in January.,Suicidal
10022,10042,The title....Even if there is no afterlife I still feel that my energy will be in the same place everyone is energy goes when we die The thought of an afterlife where I will be with all of those gone before me entices me to want to die,Suicidal
8368,8388,I am tired. So fcking tired. You can swamp yourself with all the work you can distract yourself as much as you want. But you crash eventually. Especially during the few minutes of idle time at night or before you sleep or when you grab a couple of drinks it all comes crashing down again. And you realize you do not really want to wake up at all again. Too much pain So tired,Suicidal
24353,24373,Once I post here I feel terrible. After a while I just have to do it because I cannot get it off my mind. It makes me feel like an attention seeker. that is why most of the time I write just a vent post. While I want someone to see I do not want them as well. it is odd. I do not want to be an attention seeker so I delete it after a while. I am probably going to delete this after a while. I wanted to post this because I saw a post a couple week days? ago and one of the comments mentioned people deleting their posts after a while so I wanted to see if you can relate before I feel the urge to delete it again. I sometimes think as if I should not post here and feel guilty when someone responds because they could be responding to someone who is actually struggling and needs help but they are wasting their time on me and feel the necessity to apologize. The friends that I have are online and I am kind of scared that they would think I am an attention seeker or something similar. Maybe they would hate me if they saw it so that kind of plays into the role of me deleting it. I am unsure of most things and often think I am faking it so I want to beat myself to a pulp. that is about it. If you stuck around then thank you for reading. Hey just a question. People that delete their posts after a while. Is your thought process the same as mine?,Suicidal

I really hope that nobody resents me after I do this but that is out of my control. Even right before I die I cannot stand the thought of people hating me. The thought literally makes me sick. I would say I am not really feeling anything at the moment but that would be a partial lie. On the inside I have no emotional reaction that I can feel which I usually can. But a song that means a lot to me just came on and I started to cry. Its called Might you and its in my Spotify likes aguyss well as my Anime playlist. Can you play this song at my funeral? Its from My Hero Academia so not many people there if anyone shows up will understand the context but its a good song even without knowing the series. Its 1109 pm right now. I do not know how long this note will take me. I guess I should say sorry to everyone but there are surprisingly few people that I talk to. Really its only my family and people at work. that is kind of sad. Mom and dad I am sorry that I could not be the daughter you dreamed I was going to be. Frankly I am not your daughter at all since I am was? nonbinary neither a man nor a woman. Please do not refer to me as your daughter at my funeral. I do not care if that will confuse any relatives. I love you guys. I am sorry I was such a jerk. I am really sorry that I would pick on you and fight with you and overall annoy you every single day. To make up for it you can have all of my stuffed animals as well as all of my snowglobes. I love you. I am sorry I did not work harder to be closer to you. I am sorry I was a little asshole when we were growing up which is why you hated me probably up until you went to Italy for that period of time. You were a great older sibling and I wanted to be just like you for a long time. you are the reason I got into art even though I have not really drawn anything in forever. do not be afraid to be yourself even when it seems like everything will go wrong if you do. I love you. you cannot read this. I do not even know if you can read honestly and you probably will not understand what is going on at all. Autism sucks huh? I would not really know because I do not have it. Anyways you can have my lightsabers and my Spiderman popout painting thing. And my iPad if you want. But you have to share it with . I love you. All my coworkers I am sorry if I made everything about myself. I am also sorry if I made any of you uncomfortable or if I overshared a lot. I did not really know how to cope with things obviously since I am dead now and talking about it helped me process things in a way. You are all really nice well most of you. Some of you really frustrated me and I hope you go on to find good jobs and live good lives. I considered a few of you really good friends though I doubt you thought the same of me. Cinnamon Laura and Ella I am even making a paragraph for you even though you are animals and cannot read. I loved all three of you very much and I loved spending time with you. This much is obvious but Cinnamon was my favorite. That does not mean I loved the other two any less. I hope you three receive plenty of love now that I am gone as well as belly rubs and scratches in your favorite places. I do not know what else to write. I was a really selfish person. Honestly I was also kind of an asshole. I do not know why its hard to explain but I just was. I know my parents will be angry when I say this but life was not great for me. Yeah I lived in a good home though it was really passive aggressive a lot of the time and I never felt like my emotions and opinions were respected but life is not good when you cannot feel much and when you do feel it is not good. I just cannot keep living life where I am suffering in silence was I silent about it though? I do not know. I am not that selfaware. My emotions did not really work right I have nearly acted on a LOT of intrusive thoughts and I often made things about myself when they had nothing to do with me. I guess that came from me feeling left out of things when I lived in Oregon. Speaking of Oregon MAN that place sucked. Seriously do not ever go there whoever is reading this. My opinion may be biased as I was sexually and mentallyemotionally abused from the beginning of 7th grade to halfway through 9th grade by this group of people who I considered to be friends even though they never were. 010 do not recommend it to anyone. Can you make my funeral if you hold one open casket? Also I want to wear a suit. I cannot really do anything if you put me in a dress but still do not put me in one. Also can you have nonbinary flag and pansexual flag colors in some places? Maybe put a couple pins on my suit? That would be cool. Also you can really have any food you want. Its not like Ill be eating it Is it okay to joke about that? Its dark humor and idk how many people will appreciate that. Anyone is allowed to come but make sure to invite my coworkers. Oh and do not hire a priest. I know you did not want to admit this but I do not believe in God. Sorry if you think that hurts my soul and that Ill go to hell but I do not believe in that. Who are we to say what is real and what is not when we cannot see it? Oh and I want to have all my manga. You can donate the rest of my books unless someone I know wants one as well as my clothes. can have my anime figures as well. If you want to keep it that long can have Sheldon my car. I do not have much of it but can you donate the money that I do have to The Trevor Project a charity to help mentally ill LGBTQ teens. It is now 1133 pm. I do not know when exactly Ill do it but it will be before anyone wakes up. I was supposed to meet with at 1 tomorrow but obviously that is not going to happen. Damn this was two and a half pages. Not including this sentence it was a total of 1144 words. that is more than my last essay for school was. I am such a coward are not I? Only an idiot would commit suicide. Yet here I am being a complete dumbass. Who knows maybe Ill be reincarnated and be even worse off. Or Ill be reincarnated as an elephant or a cat. ...I cannot do this. What the hell am I doing? My Suicide Note,Suicidal
20907,20927,I know other people here are struggling and I just want to say to everybody struggling I hope you all get better. Everybody going through some thing but I am cut to the chase with my storyIm a 24 year male who is thinking about suicide everyday. I had enough of life. I missed out on all the fun people had my age. I feel so fucking horrible and feel like shit as a result. I constantly ruminate about my horrible miserable past such asgetting choked out by a nfl player my freshman year of high school. What a bully he was. He plays for the Detroit lions by the way. Not going to say his namenot going to prom being a virginmy evil brother saying statements such as ill give you a gun why do not you kill yourself and abusing me physically and verbally.dropping out of high schoolbeing betrayed by friends and school officials in high schoolI have no friends and I am fucking fighting for dear life. I feel like I am in a fucking war. Sorry for the language but I plan to go back to college and see a therapist there. I am so fucking angry and depressed. The only reason why I refuse to kill myself is because I am Muslim and I just do not want to end up in hell. Come to think of it my life is a living hell I hope you all wish me well. Help? I hate my life and I just want to die,Suicidal
10217,10237,I am so fucking tired. Is there any point?,Suicidal
9046,9066,I hate posting my personal stuff but I just cannot talk to anyone and this is anonymous.I know people say they care and that they are here for me. And I doubt that I know they are here for me. But I can tell when someone knows they would not if they did not feel like they had to. Everyone leaves and I know its my fault. I become too attached and become obsessive. And I can feel the last of my friends leaving. I do not want new friends I do not want someone to tell me they care I do not want any of that. I just want to be alright. I want it all to stop hurting.I know I could have it worse. And I am not looking for attention or for someone to come be my savior. I just need to get it out there. To know someone knows that I am not okay. That I am tired. Things are not that bad in my life which is why I do not feel comfortable complaining. But I am tired of being quiet and lying about how I am doing. I just want it all to stop. I had my first therapy appointment and I lied about a lot. I told her I do not want to off myself but I think about it. Truth is I do. I would give anything to have a guilt free death. One where no one would blame themselves or others. It just happened. I struggle to keep fighting everyday. Every night I lay in bed trying to keep myself away from the medicine cabinet. I am tired of trying and just do not see the point anymore. Things are really hard but they are not,Suicidal
22956,22976,No matter how hard I hit myself cannot cut anymore it will not go away. My head is killing me. I wish I was not cared about so I could die I really do wish that. Why will not the pain stop,Suicidal
15408,15428,Whenever I ask people why I should not kill myself the first answer I always receive is Because someone loves you. They will be sad when you are goneWell what about me? What about my sadness? you are telling me that I am only supposed to stay alive for the benefit of someone else while I continue to stay here and suffer? When someone tells me why I should not do it,Suicidal
24517,24537,Everything says to call someone you trust. I have 1 friend who is busy at work my mom does not help and everytime my boyfriend tries to help we just end up arguing. Seriously i texted him saying how I was doing and that I was frustrated because i do not have a safety plan. He said its okay lay it on me and I said no because you always get frustrated not being able to help or you get sad. He said no its okay talk to me. So I did and I told him why I feel like it does not make sense for me to keep living and how much I hate this world. He takes it personally and gets sad because i do not even want to be here with him. I told him this is exactly why I said I do not want to do this. Hes upset now and says its all his fault because he said it was okay for me to vent to him. I just stopped responding because as much as it makes me feel like a see you next tuesday I do not have the capacity to comfort him rn. I do not even have the capacity to bring myself down to just being okay to be a person I certainly cannot talk him into a better place. So that leaves me with no one. And I really mean no one like I have a single family member on this side of the country and the rest are in other coasts or in another country. I feel pathetic and like I must be a bad person to have no one to be able to lean on. More so i feel like the fact that I am not able to make an effective safety plan is more of a sign that I just should not be here. Safety plan does not work,Suicidal
11004,11024,I am having dark thoughts I am in such a bad situation i cannot believe this is happening.Can anyone talk to me? I am really anxious I really need help,Suicidal
23331,23351,Shitty thing to say i know right? But i just do not care about that part anymore because I would be dead anyways so i mean... To be honest hurting people that care about me by killing myself has become such an afterthought i just do not care how bad my suicide would hurt them,Suicidal
17944,17964,Men do not have intrinsic value. We have to create our value. that is just the reality of life and I have failed in creating my value. I missed out on my best years. I was born poor and grew up ugly. I am almost 23 and not long until 30 I have not had a single friend no money failing uni no future at all. If I am going to suffer loneliness and everything else for another 50 ish years then why not cut it short? As a man I only have value if I provide something I cannot provide anything therefore I am worthless and will hang myself.,Suicidal
8513,8533,Hi my name is Nick and I just turned 18 on July 23rd I just started college and I do not know what to do with my life. I am crying as I am writing this I cannot believe I am this low in my life. I am know as the happy guy wherever I go. I go to therapist sessions but I cannot get everything out. I just put a facade over everything I cannot take it I refuse to believe I am depressed because I do not want people to think I am faking it or for them to take it as a joke. I have one friend that actually cares about me I do not even know for sure but I like to think so. I do not know what to do with my life. I hate being here and I hate everyone I just want to be dead but I want to be alive. I hate this because I know I do not have the balls to kill myself but I so badly want to do it. I want to watch all the shows that I want to watch and be with my friend. But I cannot take it I try talking to people but it does not work I do not know what to do. I am so desperate for something to happen I do not know what. How do I get this please help I cannot take it,Suicidal
15076,15096,I do not know what to do anymore. I have reached out to so many resources and I have even admitted myself to try to get the help I need. Being there made me worse they were not offering any therapy just meds. I felt crazier being locked up. And now that I am out with these resources that do not actually help I am scared. I know I will not make it by myself but none of the resources I have gotten have been able to genuinely help me. It feels like I am just here to feed into the mental health money hole. I do not feel like anyone takes me seriously..I keep fighting back the desire to kill myself but it always comes back. And when it does its when I have no hope for any help. I am really scared that I am going to finally do it one day.. Stuck,Suicidal
20320,20340,So I am aware that mostly these posts do not get much attention and I am not going to cry for help or whatever else. Would this kill be however 20 500g tablets of paracetamol 10g along with I guess a few Swigs of bourbon I have kind of considering suicide again,Suicidal

26050,26070,I do not know what to do to fix it. I try to make everyone happy and stay out of the way but I always find a way to fuck things up. I just do not know what to fucking do anymore. I do not know what to do. I am just too selfish,Suicidal

7641,7661,this got deleted from the selfharm section so I am reposting hereselfharm has been a struggle for me for a while now.the other night i had a very bad episode intense panic I have been struggling with depression and severe anxiety for a while now. so i grabbed my blade went to the bathroom and wanted to end it all. i went very very deep on my arms vertically. my dad saw my arms and grabbed the blade away from me my mom tried to help amp i was taken to the hospital where i got stitches.these past 2 days a number of people in my life have found out about the incident 2 nights ago. let me tell you not one of them has reached out to ask if i was okay or tell me they were glad i was still here. they are just so ..... nonchalant about it.its basically confirming the fears I have had for years now that if i actually went through with my urges amp committed suicide no one would care. i mean their behavior is pretty much proving it. my own siblings and parents have not said a word about it. just stay safe vanessa. that is it.i fucking wish it worked. TW just survived a suicide attempt and it feels like no one cares.,Suicidal
20815,20835,I love my little sister to death. She means the world to me and all I want is for her to be happy. She does not know how much she means to me. she is 15 and I refuse to ever burden her with such problems. I would have been long gone if I did not love and care about her so much. I do not want her to live with the pain of losing me. Though I still cannot stop the thoughts or hurting myself. I am teetering on the verge of relapsing on self harming. Things are going to shit and all my brain knows is how to hurt myself. But when I spend time with my little sister things feel so much better. I hope and pray she never has to deal with such thoughts I do. She deserves a happy life and to get away from all the negative things our family puts us through. I want to off myself but my little sister is the only thing that keeps me going,Suicidal
26034,26054,Anyone else felt like death is around the corner? Been feeling this all my life like I am going to die soon. Can remember I used to think about death from a very young age before I even really knew about death If that makes sense. I have been stuck somewhere in the middle of desperately wanting to die and wanting to live. I do not want to go out by killing myself but I want it to happen by accident like a car crash. Also prayed to God a lot that I can switch places with someone that has cancer. Just a lil vent I know some of you all feel me. Stay up. Death Around The Corner,Suicidal
25409,25429,I have only looked at this sub for 15 minutes and it already looks very saddening.

No human deserves to go through uninherited and undeserving pain I can only hope but I also give my well wishes safe health whether that be mentally or physically and I hope you guys have a better day wherever you may be. Read Plz,Suicidal
8948,8968,Does anyone else want to go because they feel life is pointless? I do not care about the simple things life has to offer. I have seen how everything can be perfect than crumble down. I do not care about being strong or fighting adversity I just want to be at peace. I live for myself and Id be happiest not being stressed. I may miss out on finding a great love but at least I save myself from experiencing heartache. I just feel life is a sham by design and I do not enjoy playing the game. I am tired of it! Its not worth it,Suicidal

11153,11173,Just wondering as I read online that a lot of helium providers now make it so their helium does not suffocate. If there was anywhere that sold either entire exit bags or exit bag approved helium or whatever I am sure you get what I mean. I know its probably illegal to sell exit bags however a shop that just happens to sell the equipment for them surely is not? Anywhere that sells exit bag materials UK?,Suicidal
11196,11216,I understand that mood swings come and go and nobody should hastily choose death. Life has alot to offer and bad things are a part of life but this has been a life in black and white for at least 14 years. Even if I recovered. I cannot forget what happened Everything feels fake. I cannot take it no more and all IS exhausted. Nothing wrong with my life right now. I have achieved what I wanted. I could work this job for 40 years. it is not my body. I can easily ride distances up to 200km in a day. Sometimes you cannot fix people. There is something wrong in my head. I do not want to continue I hate every second I have to exist. I do not want to. Why cannot I choose to stop existing? Why is it illegal for me to die. I do not want to be found dead in my apartment. I do not want to because anybody harm. I do not want to continue. If I could somehow manage to because irreversible chain of events to force me. I do not know I am tired. Maybe fire. I want to die dignified,Suicidal
8849,8869,my parents are manipulative and abusive pieces of shit. I am not a human with feelings to them. anytime I am not masking myself.. by acting polite and taking their bullshit with a smile across my face I am being disrespectful. and all hell raises when I am not being perfectly kind and helpful. people yell and throw things my parents cannot control themselves. i have very severe depression severe anxiety ADHD and DID. that contributes to not being so happy around others. my family does not know me. they do not want to know me. i just want to be someone to them i want to be understood. I am just talked down on I am forced to do everything i do not want to. my dad told me to kill myself. my mom does not care whether i live or die. its not like I am some nuisance you would see on the worlds strictest parents or whatever.. i do anything i can to stay away from my family. i barely talk. i overanalyze what i say and do before and after i.. say or do anything. I am not just careless with what i say i do not go out of my way to upset people. every day I am finding a reason to love and care for my family but they do not love me. i do not know what i possibly could have done to be treated like this. did i not put the dishes up when i was told to? did i not clean up the living room before you got home? is that why you want me to kill myself? earlier today i told my mom that i think about writing her a letter every day at this point that i do not want to be here. i asked her what she would do if i died. all she did was point out how disrespectful i am. how i do not pay bills how I am inconsiderate. she does not care if i die. my whole search history is looking up lethal doses for whatever medication i have access to. i want to slit my throat at this point nothing i have will because a quick death. but cutting my throat would be painful. i do not have a car cannot take myself to a tall building. the stove will not put out enough carbon monoxide to kill me. i want someone to kill me. i mean I am only 15 pretty young to have to feel like this. well I am getting a car soon ill be able to get out. but i do not have my license I am stuck here for now. and that is too much. this is all pointless. i had therapy going it was helping. until my mom decided she wanted weed and cut off my sessions. no one cares. no one fucking cares. my parents treat me like shit i just want to die.,Suicidal

We exchanged words as we head back in the locker room and I knew in my mind I had to fight this arrogant bully because I remember being bullied in 6th grade and I told myself that you got to stand for yourself or he is going to continue to pick on you and bully you.

17861,17881,about a month ago they kicked me out. i was venting some frustration alone in my own room without involving them and i yelled and stuff. and i guess they did not know how to handle it so they kicked me out. they were also going on about how they want to live with a housemate who is friendlier and more interactive and I am too unsociable I guess and they tried to convince me to move out for my own good. eventually i gave in because it got pretty clear that they did not want me around anymore. I am staying with my parents now and will go to my college dorms in fall. But I really cannot stop thinking about it. I am still not even clear on why they made me leave they said a lot of conflicting stuff. I have always been bad at relating to other people but this really hammered home the fact that I am never going to fit in anywhere. I am never going to be comfortable no matter who I am with or where I go. not to mention how hard it is to get and keep a job when you are this bad at socializing. i cannot even do a proper interview. I am not cut out for this world and I do not want to be part of it anymore. Honestly I just want to be alone my housemates kicked me out,Suicidal

This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.ampx200BMay 2019 Depressed I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1xday. ampx200BSeptember 2019 I go off of Zoloft again.

I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1xday. ampx200BMarch 2021 I go off of Wellbutrin. ampx200BWellbutrin 100mg1x per day continues for monthlong streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June. ampx200B End of June 2021 I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastiaZoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth and how my jaw did not click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral. ampx200BJuly 2 2021 I take my father's competition ruger out of the case next to his bed I am at my parent's house here. I hold it. I look at it. I wonder... I do not cry or whatever. I try to fight. I try to think about what I can do differently but nothing really happens. I put the gun back in its case and I decide to light a bowl and get high. I pass out at the top of my parent's stairs until 2pm in the afternoon. I had off of work and the rest of the family is at our vacation house so I was home alone. ampx200BJuly 3 2021 I decide to book a tee time and drop a 72 on 18holes from the tips here at our home course with a 33 3 on the back nine. Golf is a big passion of mine and I have my own horror stories of trying to play in collegethroughout highschool that I will not get into. I have played golf my entire life. July 4 2021 today I wake up depressed again. Not high this time but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything from how my dick is fucked up to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything. I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I am unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really do not know how to operate a ruger and the magazines are out though there are bullets in the magazines. I frighten myself again and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say I am really having a tough time here man. I do not know what to do. 1024am July 4 2021 I hit post here on Reddit then grab my keys and head into town for my habitual coffee. 26 yo male Getting very close scared myself for the first time and unsure of if it is only a matter of time before I go through with it,Suicidal

I have been to doctors and I know it will be possibly years until I get a diagnosis and half the time they assume I have an STI or have been sexually abused. I cannot have sex with my boyfriend and even the thought of seeing him makes me tense into painful spasms I am not sure why. This is not a battle I want to fight. My best friend had epilepsy and I did not bother to understand how painful it was for her this is my punishment.

17559,17579,I am writing this while drinking a bottle of wine while crying and as the title says i think I have instantly hit rock bottom i thought i could not get any lower when you try to come out about my depression here i am. I am planning on killing myself soon but i just felt i needed to put this.I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts the notion of wanting to not have been born feels natural. I think it started when i was 4 and getting beat and locked up in a storeroom at home and getting bullied in school.One of my first memories was of my older sister getting dragged to the storeroom to be locked up while I stood there crying thinking back this might have been the first time i disassociated from reality i still remember how it felt like i had no control over my body just watching the movie play out. I try to pretend like those two years do not bother me but it does. I can still clearly see flashes of those 2 years and i hate it.There were about 3 points in my life where i resolved to kill myself When i was 5 where a kid who was bullying me bit me on the face for using the toilet before he did and i was blamed by the school for starting the fight i remember that was the first time i seriously thought of ending it nobody would believe me because his friend said i started it. This was the first time you locked me in my room and looked out the window of my apartment and thought long about jumping. Eventually i pussied out and i blanked out for a long time after that i cannot even remember what happened after that it felt like memory only resumed after i saw my abuser get punished at 6 years old.The second time i resolved to unexist was when i was put into a school far away from my home i knew no one there and as a person who is bad at talking i naturally got bullied my already shitty health got worst i had terrible stomach pains particularly in the morning i was afraid to leave my home. My books were glued table vandalized i felt the whole class was against me. Then one day when a guy was pouring water on my table I snapped i think i had my first anxiety attack i pulled his arm hard thinking of smashing his face in but then I instantly started crying i felt intense fear my heart was beating out of whack I felt like everyone was laughing at me i could not breathe my stomach churning and my mind went blank. My teacher talked to me after class but at that point I have fully disassociated I do not think i heard anything i just went ok for everything. I started skipping more classes feeling like my room was the only safe place i fell asleep almost every night crying about how big a disappointment i was to my parents how useless i am i have no talenfs i was only a burden on everyone the only thing i deserved was to die. i was planning to do so but once again i pussied out my useless urge to live won out because a man on youtube saved my life he was a comedian from sourcefed at that time his name was Steve Zaragoza when i was 13 he was pretty much what was keeping me alive with sourcefed table talks and what he said i think pretty much saved my life he said the stopped getting bullied because he became the funny kid. So i became the funny kid i started craving attention everyone liked me i was the goofy fucker one of the class clowns but that was only temporary.The urge to end it lessened and i soon started going to the gym.I was getting better. I was at 105Kg about 200lbs back then and through out 2 years i lost about 30Kg about 65lbs. I thought that at that point i would feel happier and more confident i would become OK but it did not the thoughts at the back of my head still remained. i went off the diet and i gained back all the weight by the time 6 monthes passed every though i ate normally this shit just made me give up hope losing weight.The third time in the past i tried to end it was when i was in 2018 at about 17 and 18 years old i went into the school i wanted the school and course my parents wanted i thought i was happy my sense of self worth was at its peak and i thought i had made my whole family proud being the topp 10 but of course again i was wrong i could not handle the pressure of my course i coundn't wrap my head around the subjects taught and from that pressure i decidedd to run away i skipped my classes my exams dropped ou planned to work for a while go on holiday and then end it after the holiday settleing some loose ends. I Planned to die did not decide the method this time but it was what i felt was rock bottom. I never tried to tell anyone besides as disgusing it as a joke to friends never said anything to to family or to any doctors i just kept it to myself because i thought no one deserves to be burdened by my shit and i was embarrassed and scaredBut i think the reason i did not kill myself was my niece i watched over her often as my sister was working and her father was a piece of fucking shit. I felt like i was her father i felt like i had to be there for her i did not want her to have a shitty shildhood i wanted her to grown up healthy and sane.Turns out i was ok with working i enjoyed my time talking to customers the pay was enough for me and i felt like my life was amounting to something i felt sort ok and then covid came knocking and the lock down began. The lockdown brough my family closer i soon had a nephew too and felt responsible for him soon after. I wanted to be there for them. I want them to be fuckin normal people unlike me me. I wad happy for a whiel.Now brings us to current times lockdown is over i was conscripted into the military like every other man in our ountry. I went through my 1 month basic trainig thinking i would get a job that would let me go home everyday like a 9 to 5 but i did not i had to stay in a military camp from sunday night to friday i cannot see my familt the thoughts were getting more and more frequent and i after just a few weeks of staying here the feeling of it feels stronger and stronger but i could not just leave my friend to handle everything so i endured for a while.Yesterday at the military doctors office i just blurted out my anxious feelings and some outher shit that i could not put into words properly and he asks me to come back later but with my superiors and 2 other random guys in the office i choked while they accused me of lying and lectured me about growing up and just deal with it while i was too nervous i could not form a sentence through the doctor saying why i did not highlight the issue to previous doctors it did not make sense for me to say it now. I fully disassociated. I did not cry i just agreed with what they said like it was the truth i had once again truly decidded to kill myself after 3 years.The first time i try to tell anyone about my issue did not belive me and instead put me through a interrogation discredited and berated me the entire time. I have hit even lower than what i thought was possible.There is no hope there is no meaning i should not exist. My life has ni value. My wine is done and my drugs are in me hopefully this is my last day. Also sorry about the errors and long post. Good afternoon good evening and goodnight. Instantly pushed to rock bottom,Suicidal

I do not want to reveal too much but I think I ruined a relationship with someone who I see as a mother figure and a friend of mine is making a big deal out of the situation in my opinion. Another friend has also been affected by this and they mean alot to me.I do not know how to handle this situation right now especially with my friend who is hurting alot.

I want to cuddle and not get anxious if I am breathing loudly. BREATHING LOUDLY?!?! I want to love and to be fully loved and accepted in return. I know I am hard to love and I am so sorry that I am the way I am. But it is a part of me and I cannot change that. I thought I found somebody they said they understood and that they would help me through it and not leave and they did. And in the most terrible way. And I am just sorry. I am so sorry that I am unlovable and stupid but...I am a stupid girl who still believes that maybe...just maybe...someone or something is out there... I just want to be loved,Suicidal

14533,14553,um well so far my life has been pretty shit to say the least I grew up emotionally abused but a black household does not see it that way which sucks in all honesty I mean I have been thinking about suicide for 4 years and I cannot keep going on like this. I cannot talk to anyone in my family because of my crippling social anxiety I have tried to get better with all this depressing sad shit and it has not worked one bit I have done up to everything suggested and things I have thought of myself and none of it has worked I have only felt good for a few days then I went back spiraling into my emotions for along time I have hated the way life was and the way people behaved and acted towards each other and me. Sometimes I wake up with thoughts of hurting people or hurting myself daily and I would not even be able to speak to a family member about getting a therapist or psychiatrist because they do not believe in that one bit and I do not know what to do because I sometimes feel no emotional attachment towards my family I am not even 18 yet and my birthdays next month I in reality did not want to make it there because all I wanted was a family that I felt love from and to be loved yes anticlimatic i know but I have had very bad self doubt and it just gets worse I have hated my appearance and I have hated the way I have looked for years I have always felt ugly tried many things to feel better about my appearance but nothing works in all honesty lol I know I am spewing random shit but this is the best I can do I wanted to be happy for along time and I am still trying but I have given up hope after today. There was a girl that I cared about very much skip the blah blah shit we broke up and she told me she had feelings for my best friend after reassuring me that she did not like him he liked her they are now together and I am just stuck here in a horrible position I have wanted to kill myself for along time I just cannot find a way successfully Either today or the next few days I am going to end everything,Suicidal

Nothing gives me joy everything tastes like bland nothingness and the only emotions I feel are boiling rage or total depression.I also have tinnitus and sleep apnea. Which means I can barely fall asleep due to the extreme anxiety and the constant sound of EEEEEEE in my ears. And when I do fall asleep I am woken up every 1030 minutes because my body stops fucking breathing. My therapist and everyone I speak to just say stay positive and be patient and small steps! Like any of that fucking helps.My past is abuse my present is pain and misery and my future holds nothing for me. What the fuck am I meant to be living for at this point? Unbearable 247,Suicidal

9965,9985,This is it. This is adulthood. I cannot fucking believe i was forced into this mess because two morons suffered from a lack of critical thinking. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?I never suffered a day in the void. Nothing fucking bothered me but now i got to go to work. Fuck off. Why dad? Why could not you just keep in your pants. A literal seconds spares me decades of suffering. But no pulling out required empathy. Asshole.This is it. This is adulthood. There is no magical man in the sky. There is no afterlife. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no reward for my suffering. There is no magical rainbow. My soulmate does not exist. Nobody is coming to save me. Nobody gives a shit. There is no meaning. There is no purpose. The universe was a mistake.It was all a mistake. The universe was a mistake. I would erase everything if i had the infinity gauntlet i would. Without a doubt or hesitation. It would spare trillion upon trillion of sentinel beings. Ending everything would be an act of pure empathy. No amount of happiness can out way our suffering and inevitable death. How could any god create this place? is he dumb? Does he not care? Is he dead as well? Fuck him or her or it whatever the fuck it is. How could it?I cannot see the bright side of life. There is no bright side without ignorance. My ignorance is long gone. I challenged lifes values and looked into the void and now i wish to have no part of life troubles. I wish i could erase myself. i want to free from the shackles of life.So much suffering for no reason. Over a million suicides per year. Cancer. Heart disease. Stroke. Diabetes. The list goes on forever and for what? Nothing. To end up in the dirt slowly eaten by bacteria and maggots. What a cruel joke.I wish i killed myself at 15. I truly do. Would have spared myself. I should have finished resident evil 4 for the last time ate two chocolate donuts jacked off and blew my brains out. I should have. Nothing was worth it. Like cioran said you always kill yourself too late. He was right.I do not want to grow upi do not want to be a productive member of this life cult. I do not want to be a socalled adult. I refuse all of this. I want out. Let me die. I refuse all the responsibilities that were FORCED upon me. I do not want a job. I do not want to pay taxes. I do not want any of this shit. Leave me alone or let me die.This is it. it is only going to get worse. is not it? I wish someone loved me. Maybe i would not think this way. I refuse to be an adult. i refuse all of this shit. I am not just another number in the machine. How dare my parents impose life upon me? Who gave them the right?Fuck humanity. Fuck life the universe was a mistake.

22293,22313,i have not contemplated suicide in 8 days. i was in a horrible place just one month ago was admitted to the psych ward and now I am somewhat happy. my depression social anxiety and ocd are finally under control. i can literally just socialize without sweating from fear or my brain fogging up to the point where i can barely speak. its insanewhen i see my friends I am talkative again I am the guy they grew up with instead of the depressed quiet shithead who showed up and never spoke. i find myself genuinely enjoying things again. one month ago fun or happiness was a feeling i had not felt in years. my selfesteem has improved too. one month ago i was completely convinced that i was a worthless horrible person who deserved to burn in hell. i was convinced i was useless and capable of nothing. now i think I am an ordinary human being. i matter as much as everyone else does. I am not inferior to my friends or family. I am a regular guy I am me and I am not a bad person. i feel like I have unlocked the world. there is so much out there for me to do so many people to meet and talk toits not all perfect. I am still extremely lazy. ill have bad days. i continue to have ptsd flashbacks and i still struggle with addiction. but every emotion i feel feels like it occurs naturally. one month ago this was the last thing i wanted to hear but things really do get better. i hope that everyone reading this gains at least a sliver of hope for the future.

15344,15364,I have always had bad acne. I have tried pretty much every treatmentsolution you can think of including accutane and although my face is pretty clear for the most part my body acne just does not go away. ever. I have tried dozens of different products tips and been to multiple dermatologists and nothing takes it away. it makes me furious to see girls that can wear revealing clothes comfortably and naturally while I cannot because nobody wants to see acne. Its not attractive to anyone. I cannot be intimate bc I am too insecure about it. And it never goes away. What reason do I have to live? my acne is making me want to die,Suicidal

22677,22697,Sometimes I like the fact that I am useless and a depressed little shit. It calms me down knowing that I do not have to try super hard because either way Ill probably fail. Sometimes I wish other people would dislike me more. That way they will not have to expect great things from me and be disappointed in the long run. Sometimes I like feeling worthless in this big wide world. No one will annoy me they will just let me be. Not worth it to engage with me. I find comfort in being useless.,Suicidal
12514,12534,I am grateful that I have friends and family that want to understand me but I cannot put what troubles me mentally into words. How do I explain static and nothingness?

Why cannot I let people get close?,Suicidal
9715,9735,I think I finally hit that point where I am at ease with dying. I have a plan 99 sure it will work after doing extensive research. God if my dad saw my search history yikes. I am going to pay off the bill I owe to my grandparents get rid of some of my stuff so my dad do not have to and then Ill just do it. My dad his gf are never home I am a adult so it do not matter. But I know when I am ready they will be gone for the weekend and I can do it. They probably will not find my body for a while because they only come in my room every couple of months I am always at work or sleeping so it does not really matter. Either way I am at the point where I know I am ready. Having it planned out has me a peace which is weird but I guess that is how you know its your time. 19F,Suicidal
23672,23692,I am so fucking tired of this my life sucks i got held back again so I am a freshmen when i should be a junior because i never do my work i have no irl friends no actual hobbies ill play videogames n stuff but what 16 year old boy does not play videogames i have some online friends i even was edating someone and they were the only one of the people online i feel i could actually talk too i wanted to help her i wanted to be their for her her guardian angel as corny as that sounds because she has severe depression i was the last person she talked to after she tried killing herself by taking pills when we were close friends i always liked her romantically tho and she tried to kill herself after we broke up once she asked me if id be said if she killed herself. And she is also anorexic she only eats 500 calories a day. I found out when we were dating that the reason she tried to kill herself was because she thought noone would ever love her flaws and all i thought of how i told her i thought her cuts were beautiful never encouraged it and how she must be happy now. And then she broke up with me over some stupid shit on my end and now i have no one and apparently she is already with someone i feel she might have been lying to me. It does not help that I have been upset over her since march before we even dated. Honestly idek if i should be posting in this subreddit its not like I am about to kill myself right now or anything but i want to die I am just afraid of suffering so guns would probably be the only way id kms wonder how long ago i would have done it if i had a gun I want to die,Suicidal

15921,15941,I am 19f a second year undergraduate. I am struggling to finish the pending work for my courses and know I will not be able to.quit an important internship so I could focus on completing pending work I was not able to do bc of the anxiety I had this term. my professors are very understanding. I struggle with anxiety and depression. I am grateful for having supportive family friends and professors but I cannot stop thinking about how people must now realise that I am very unreliable and will not have a future. When it comes to others it is easy for me to feel like self worth is not defined by academic success or productivity necessarily. yet it is pretty hard to apply this shit to myself. I am too scared to even face these profs and ask for what I can do and the next steps I can take.My peers have worked their butts off in this miserable pandemic some of them having terrible home conditions facing the loss of their loved ones from covid. yet how are they so strong and able? why am I so bad at keeping up? I am trying to focus on things I am good at. I know I help my friends when they are sad and I care about them. I am good at helping my mom when she needs to vent or needs advice on how to deal with some problems. I know I will not have the guts to do what it takes to end things for myself but I cannot help but wish that things just happened to magically end for me.I am sorry for ranting idk what to do rn I do not have the strength to speak to others feeling unreliable,Suicidal

I do not know what to do anymore I tried so hard to make friends in high schools and university. Talked to as many people as I could invited people to hang out and yet I am still unable to make any friends. I am never invited to any parties nor am I added in any group chats. I do not have a friend group. what is wrong with me why am I such a failure? My parents invested so much money and time into my studies and yet I am failing at uni. I am unable to find a good internship and job unlike the people around me. I am an idiotic failure. I do not know what to do with my life at this point. I wished everything would just turn into nothingness. I am tired of trying and struggling. I want to end it. I am so tired of everything,Suicidal
17624,17644,there is just so much to say..I was one of those people who would try to help all those here and on various other suicidal subreddits. I would tell them to hang in there and try to count their blessings when did I change? When did I get so filled up with sadness and loneliness?My heart it is this huge hole it keeps growing bigger and bigger heavier and heavier. I am always on the edge like the tears would fall out any moment. I do not have any friends irl my parents do not allow me on socials so being here is actually me desperately trying to find friends. Some of them are begging me to find therapy and they keep asking people advice for a depressed friend. it is a label now I am depressed. And I hate that I hate how I cannot be happy even though I am so good at pretending to be. I feel like I am annoying people being a burden to them making their lives miserable. My parents think I am destroying them by being rebellious not eating and stuff they say I want to die like it is my fault if I do want to. I know they love me but they have stopped appreciating me completely. I tried to tell them I am lonely like 4 times and they taunted me saying that why do I need anyone in my life. Why? Because I cannot control my thoughts they haunt me traumatise me.I recently 4 months ago had my first break up and it has left me in shattered pieces. I loved him so much. he is now dating and I am having these sharp pains in my chest I am nauseous all day my entire body aches my hormones are all over the place. I have even started to get nightmares where he would kill me stab me over and over again and hug me telling me it will be alright.I cannot bear the pain anymore. I tried to use online therapy since my parents will not allow actual professional help and I chickened out. I am just so scared if they will find out and god knows what will happen then. I am not even sure if I should post this...I feel like I am whining for no reason at all I do not want to die I am so scared I am scared of everything,Suicidal
24561,24581,we are online friends so i cannot know for certain but either they died or passed out from what they were trying and I have been trying to distract myself via videos and stuff but it is still lingering on in my head i do not want to lose them and the worse part is that i have not even fully processed this yet and I am still crying i just hope they are alive I am doing my own method rn but it will take over a week to kill me and that is only if i do it correctly i think one of my friends just killed themself,Suicidal

24939,24959,TW Seual Asult slf harmim not sure how long this will be but I just need to get some things off my mind for the time being. so hopefully this helps? my journey with depression started in 5th grade. I was practically bullied everyday never physically but the words just stuck with me. 6th grade came around and my depression just slowly started getting worse. this is when my long journey of self harm started i will not go into detail but i got to the point that id do anything just to feel something other than sadness. this is when my friends slowly started to stop talking because they noticed the shift of energy. we were kids we were not supposed to feel this way and nobody else wanted to be around someone that was like me. because of this i turned a majority of my time and focus to social media i stated creating anonymous accounts just so i could have somewhere to express what i was feeling. i some how got sucked into a rabbit hole that lead me to kik. if any of you know that app had been busted numerous times because of the child groomers that were on the app. this is when i had my first experience of being manipulated by an adult. again i will not go into detail but this happened for months. skipping to 8th grade I am still self harming at this point. a friend ended up seeing the marks which caused me to just change methods. Eventually i did quit because i just knew it was time for me to give it up. From my freshman year to my sophomore year my depression stayed steady. I was still experiencing suicidal thoughts but i knew i was not at risk of going through with it. I wanted to die but i just could not get myself to go through with it? i guess its a fear of not knowing what will happen after? My junior year of high school was the start of a downward spiral i would have never predicted to happen. I ended up losing my dad we thankfully had a good relationship. i was 16 so it absolutely destroyed me when he passed especially with how sudden it was. I ended up binge eating constantly because it was my way of trying to cope. in total i believe i lost about 4 relatives that year. a few months go by and i start talking to this guy we end up hanging out and this is when i was sexually assaulted aka this is how i lost my virginity. the reason i feel so guilty is because i continued to talk to him after and we met up twice after. i truly just wanted him to want me the movies made it seem like losing your virginity was this magical thing. i just feel like people would say that i was not sexually assaulted because I continued to see him? but i swear i said no multiple times i tried to push him off of me i can vividly remember what his weight felt like i felt as if bricks had been stacked on my chest to the point i could barely breathe. to this day i can still remember what it felt like it nearly sends me into a panic attack everytime.after this i knew nothing would ever be normal again. i remember going home showering immediately and i just scrubbed at my skin for what felt like hours. you are probably wondering why did not you report it?. i was scared my mom thought i had been hanging with a friend not a guy 4 years older than me. in the moment i thought id be the one in trouble. this still haunts me to this day i always wonder if there was more i could have done. i would try to think of any excuse for what happened. anyways i had told 3 close friends about what had happened and my guy friend said it sounds to me like something you just regret and that you are trying to make an excuse. which again caused me to feel even worse. after this i just kind of used my body as a way to seek validation? i was constantly having sex in the attempt to make someone want to be with me. and that brings us to now obviously there is tons of other things but this message is just getting too long. I picked up a few addictions along the way but I am working on it. its been rough and i wish i had the time to tell every detail but maybe one day. I have made it to 19 I have been thinking of starting therapy and possibly getting a diagnosis. its been rough and to this day everyday feels like a battle. but i refuse to give up there is too many countries i want to visit. you do not have to read I just need to rant,Suicidal

22981,23001,Just the feeling of having no family and no friends. Long before I started actively feeling suicidal and pushing people away it became abundantly clear that nobody was actually looking out for my best interests that nobody wanted me around that if I did anything to help myself be myself or try to get out of this hole that existential physical and social depression put me in it would be met with punishment. So I started pushing people away. Anyone who stuck by did so for amusement. it is never been funny to me so I do not see much of a way out besides certain death. I tried speaking my truth but it has never been worth it. Nobody wants me to be alive. I guess I stopped being useful a long time ago. The thought of being useful now makes me feel even depressed disgusted. There is no way out. The light stopped shining a long time ago. I get told to give up everywhere I go by everything that happens to me and the expressions of people all around me. If my existence is such a nuisance I might as well kill myself. I tried telling this to friends and it was just a joke to them. Where I live I am told I do not exist or should not. I feel dead already. I have not been spoken with in such a long time. I am about to give up. What really does it,Suicidal
14501,14521,Look I do not really use reddit much this is my first time actually making a post so forgive me if I somehow mess it up and I am insanely shy even pressing the post button takes me lots of build up.. Anyways ever since I was young I always had thoughts of suicide but through my entire life I have just tried ignoring them.My mom her being a single mom due to a divorce from my father abusing drugs and being abusive to all of us which I would rather not delve into did not have much spare time to spend with me and my sister. However my sister would frequently spend loads of time with my dad he even called her his real son. They had a very strong connection despite everything. My sister was insanely smart throughout highschool and college always top of her class played all kinds of sports knew exactly what she wanted out of life since she was like 6. I will skip all her merits and get to the point. She was always the center of attention and everyone I mean everyone wanted me to be just like her because if she could do it surely I could to right? In school I was known as her brother no one knew who I was and neither did I.I did spend some time with my dad as a kid whether it was him taking me to vandalize mailboxes go hunting which I hated or just do anything you can imagine luckily I rejected most of what he considered fun and strived to be better. When I was 4 and my sister was 7 he took us into the woods left us then drove off telling us to find a way home. And no he did not hide around and watch us to make sure we were safe he left us all alone and went out with some random chick to further his many affairs only for us to make it home hours later after someone driving on a dirt road found us. I am giving this as an example of what he did daily I could dive into the story of him pulling out two of my teeth way before they were ready because he once spilled a thing of popcorn and wanted to take his anger out on someone.My mom on the other hand was a great mother she did everything she could for us and I owe her everything.I was never a trouble maker despite my childhood experiences I strangely loved following rules and was always a nice person genuinely. Also I should clarify I live in the middle of nowhere and my passions have always been with technology which is not very available out here. Also another thing i lied like a lot a lot a lot without ever feeling bad I have always had those edgy teenage thoughts about really messed up stuff being just a joke.READ STARTING HERE IF THIS IS TOO LONGI'm leaving out a lot as I just realized how long this is basically I felt like I never figured out who I was or what I wanted like everything I told myself I wanted was just what everyone else wanted me to do. I always had extreme anxiety I have never cared about relationships have 0 sexual desire and most importantly I feel like I am always in my head talking to myself constantly and even sometimes speaking out loud without noticing all my symptoms were and still are ignored I did experience sadness most everyday but tried my best to hide it. Even in school I wanted to do better because I knew I could but never allowed myself to try. IMPORTANT PART. Weirdest of all everyone around me sometimes feels.. automated? Like their entire lives and emotions are running like a machine. I have always thought that maybe I am supposed to be like that and I was just missing something mentally like I was defective and became self aware. My depression if you can call it that feels more like an error code and feeling this way I suppose is what makes me feel suicidal like I am flawed not good enough and should not exist.I want things out of life I want to move out I want to learn about software development I want to get a job again yet I always feel insanely weak like moving my body is a challenge. Simple tasks like washing dishes became a days worth of tasks. Plus I can never catch onto social norms things just fly over my head. With simple things being so difficult it makes big goals seem impossible I have no motivation. I feel like I am lazy even though I do not want to be.Being this way makes me feel incredibly selfish at least I have always been told that. Suicide was considered the most selfish possible thing by my mom and all I want to do is make her proud of meI tried joining the airforce scored a 92 on my asvab without even studying but at MEPS I had a mental breakdown and felt I would go through with suicide If I kept lying to myself and I knew that was a no go in the military so I backed out at the last moment which only made me feel like an even bigger failure.I do not know if I should see a doctor. Maybe I am overreacting and just dramatic I wish I could keep talking and say everything but it is just too much to say. Every second I think of ending it and its incredibly hard to focus on improving myself when that is always blaring in my brain.TLDR less than average childhood always alone through life feel weak at all times. Mind is constantly blaring for me to kms not like voices just talking to myself Everyone feels like a robot. I want to get better but at the same time I am not sure if its worth the effort or if I can even get better. I am almost convinced it would just be easier to end it all now and save myself from more suffering as I know my life is not even that bad meaning it could get worse. My depression feels more like a calculation just like everything in my life and the most logical answer I could find is to end it since its easier than fixing it. I am sorry this is so long. I have just held a lot in for a long time and this is my first time ever trying to talk about it if anyone took time to read this I greatly appreciate it I am confused and feel selfish,Suicidal
10402,10422,I just started a job in customer service. Working from home fortunately. I have been unemployed most of this year and I have been a financial burden on my boyfriend. This sweet man even offered to get a second job so I would not have to work. But I could not do that to him. I want to be better. it is just so hard. My training ended last week and today I am going into calls. To add to the stress and anxiety my training was not very good. I have no idea what I am doing. I have panic attacks and cry every day and going into calls is going to make it worse. I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts but today is one of the worst days. I cannot sleep. I can only think about how much I want to die. I keep thinking if I just end it now I do not have to deal with work. It would be so much easier. The only thing that is been keeping me grounded this year is my dog and she only does so much to keep me levelheaded. I want to quit. I do not want to go in. I really think this job will kill me. I cannot even afford therapy. And I will not get insurance until my 60 day mark. What should I do? I quit my last job also customer service because it was wearing on my mental health and I could not handle it anymore. I just want to be happy. But one second I am totally fine. I have come to terms with this and I have convinced myself it will be okay. The next I am a bawling mess and having a panic attack and wanting to end it all. People always say it gets better but that is such a load of bull. My life has consistently been shit. I do not need to love my job. I just do not want to hate it this much. I do not want it to destroy me. I cannot get the help I desperately need and I am not alright. Has anyone else been in this situation? Did anything help? What did you do? Because I am more alone and lost than I have ever felt in my life and I am trying to find any excuse to hit the exit button. But maybe it is just better that way. New job in customer service and I have SAD. Great.,Suicidal

But will it fix this black space where there should be loving people. And before you judge and think I am not a good person to be friends with I am. I have been an amazing person to my friends but there is just something about me that repels people. I cannot help it. No matter how much I buy people or fix their mental health or get them on the right supplements and in the right investments.. I get dumped like I am nothing. NOTHING. Why would I want to hurt them all? I want them to hurt. I want them to know how much damage they inflicted on me. I want them to change.

18825,18845,I feel sick I feel like I want to vomit. I hate the goblin I have to live as everyday. I despise my small dick and the fact that I did nothing to deserve it. I do not want to keep living as this laughing stock and I will not do so.ampx200BI am posting this on my alt for obvious reasons I never ended up using it for anything anyways. For the past few hours I have just been feeding myself as much suicide fuel as I can to try to get myself so down that I will not pussy out and yet here I am writing a post on Reddit about it humans are strong. I read a bunch of screenshots of women sharing their disgust at small penises women cheating on their boyfriends because their dick was too small and then women feeling satisfaction seeing that small dicked fucker be sad and depressed. I think I have had enough I want to puke. Partly because I am so sad that it is making me nauseous but also because of how disgusting I feel in my body.ampx200BObviously there are other huge issues in my life than my dick size but this was the straw that broke the camel's back I am over trying to get better. I have all the stereotypical problems of every nolife dude ever. To anyone with an above average penis I hope this post was satisfiying to you that you got to feel good and validated for doing absolutely nothing and that seeing a person who is objectively below you give up like they should was empowering. Survival of the fittest baby darwinism and all that shit I am not one of the fittest and I will not try to be anymore.ampx200BI am not looking for advice this is more of a suicide note than anything. The least I can do for society is serve as study proof for why people commit suicide. I will not say what my method is since someone could use it as an idea and that would be indirectly teachingencouraging suicide and I do not want this post to be removed. I want this to stay up as my sort of final fuck you to everyone even if only a couple people see this I will be happy. Good luck in life people. Fuck my small dick fuck the whole world and everybody in it. I will die bitter and hateful and everyone will be happy.,Suicidal

14082,14102,I am so sick of being alive.Its been 10 years now that my depression has been making me suicidal to the point where I am so obsessed with death and fantasising about me dying. I have had therapy when I was younger but was discharged at 17 because I was too old and left still in the same state I was in when I first got help. My first suicide attempt was at 9 years old. That was 10 years ago and I am still the same. I truthfully believe nothing will get better so I have gave up. I do not WANT to try anymore. I do not WANT to live a life where I am crippled with severe body dysmorphia and other problems. I am too afraid to leave the house I cover my face in public in fear Ill scare people. I hate myself. Death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life. I do not want to breathe anymore. I do not want to be on this earth. I have tried for years to get better and I have not gotten anywhere. I have my first therapy appointment in august I am not sure if I am going to go I do not see the point tbh. I do not want help,Suicidal
14333,14353,I am not trying to be dramatic or anything but I honestly just hate life and want to die very badly. Living is constant mental pain and i hate it. I have also come to realization that life is pointless and it has no meaning even if life did have meaning I still would not enjoy it. In my case suicide is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem because my problem is that I hate life and that is never going to change so suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem for me. Suicide is the only thing that will fix my problem and give me peace. I honestly do not want to live anymore. 16M,Suicidal

But I feel like my actions prove my point.I threatened suicide in a fight with my mother I get blackout drunk and kiss random guys even though I have a boyfriend who loves me the shame I carry makes it so hard to not to kill myself.How can I make this up to my mother and how do I go on in life without feeling like a toxic burden to everyone close to me?

7123,7143,I recently found this subreddit and a lot of these posts are so relatable. there is so much things I can talk about.My friends distanced away from me due to my constant talks about it.I feel despair when I want to but I cannot. I cannot because I am unsure about the method. I want the method to be painless.I cannot since Id hurt my family. I want to end my life this winter but a friend starts bashing me. Calling me to stop playing the victim and associates my suicide as an act of displaying ego. This happened last night and in a few hours I wanted to end my life and call 911. I chose not to call them since idk if mine was serious enough. I just really wanted to end my life but I did not have any tools to do so. I did not call since I work everyday and I do not want to lose this job. Its so hard to get hired nowadays. I hate not able to sleep at night. My friends are not equipped to listen or comfort me. I do not have access to therapy. I plan to go to therapy once I start school again. College student btw. I hate feeling alone and worthless.

23299,23319,Well SuicideWatch been thinking a lot of doing suicide but when i think things are shit they just get a little bit better and that is fine i think. they have never let me do anything since I was 8 no friends no hanging out with friends that stuff. My friends had to move somewhere else and then i was all alone for 5 entire years on high school i made a couple of friends most of them leaved them because different reasons money they died etc. I got into a fight and i almost lost my eye. I live in a box since I am never allowed to leave out of house just to go to the market or when i go with my grandma etc but after that nothing. On Preparatory Higher than high school at least on Mxico i made a bunch of female friends just for the 1st semester and then all alone again. My parent's marriage is tearing apart they shut between themselves a lot lately like for a month or so they have been so toxic. Tomorrow my grandma is going to have a party and i bet they will get mad at each other. I want to escape i do not really want to commit suicide not even if i do not even feel pleasure from jerking off etc i do not feel any pleasure from it i never feel happy just when i play with some friends online that i constantly get yelled at because i spend a lot more time on the computer lately. I would really love to leave my country so i can start a new life i have even tried getting a sugar mommy so i get out of the country yet it have not happened. But this suicidal thoughts started since i was 11 when my little sister was born my father loves her a lot she even gets more attention from my dad making my mom angry and viceversa. I do not really know what to do i do not feel pleasure anymore in almost anything no joy in anything i just feel sadness anger sometimes i feel horny but that is it i have dated online a lot of girls yes but in the end that maked me feel even worse i never had a true friend or a real girlfriend nor anything. I would use some kind of advice thank you. Another suicidal thought,Suicidal
19878,19898,I am a single 36 M I have been having suicidal thoughts since I was about 14. I feel the end is coming soon. I work a good job and have my own apartment and car I also travel regularly. I also have no friends I also have no motivation to make friends or meet women. I recently started paying for my cremationno viewing or memorial and the funeral home is disposing of my ashes. I also moved from a shitty apartment to e decent one I quit drinking I have sought out professional help but anything the therapists have said goes in through one ear and out the other. I am so sick of you are not alone and there is help i know that but I do not want the help. I am just waiting to pay off my cremation. As of right now I am just going through the motions and making it look like I am putting in the effort but the reality is my mind is already made up. My final purchase will be the .12 gauge I am using on myself only reason I do not buy it now is because if be too tempted to use it. Well planned suicide.,Suicidal

15121,15141,there is no colour in my life. nothing I enjoy. Why the FUCK AM I LIKE THIS. I am ripping apart like a shitty toy. I fucked my arm up again cut it until there was nowhere else left to cut then cut a bit more. Everyone says hope is like a unicorn hard to find. Wrong It does not fucking exist. Anything someone says is hope is like putting a party hat on a horse and saying it is the aforementioned unicorn. If I get one good fucking reason why I should live some real hope I will not kill myself. But I might as well do it now because it does not fucking exist. Asking for a reason to keep going just gives me a hundred other reasons why I should just end it tonight. I have already marked the artery that I will cut so I am sure I will not miss. I am so devoid of hope I do not even know what it means. Everything's gone grey,Suicidal

12513,12533,It feels like nobody takes me seriously as human being with emotions. To be fair i have tendency to hide most of them. Having communication problems does not help when you are used to being misunderstood or misheard you start to give up. So finally reached the point where suicide does not sounds so bad. Having to much acquaintances from you local suicide hotline prevent me from calling it. And even more i really would hate myself more if i ask someone i know for help bothering them seems like waste of their time especially on such lowlife as myself. Currently looking for best method to end it all so my organs atleast could be harvested afterwards. Sorry for being incoherent but this is the best i can do right now. I feel like human trash,Suicidal

I envy pretty women with perfect hour glass figures and I honestly thought of harming them and even had thoughts of killing them as well. Its super toxic I know but its a way I cope with my hatred towards myself since I am running out of spaces on my body to cut to help with the stress and mind fuckery I am putting myself through. My self worth is defined by my apperance I could not give a less of a crap what anyone thinks about my spirit or personality.

I cannot bear the idea of having to face up to things again. I have just had enough of trying to make it through every day and for what? People have been telling me for years that it will get better that the depression will not last yet here I am still spending every single day hoping to die.

25040,25060,So for the past 3 years I have been selfharm free I have never had the urge to cut or anything not even do anything dangerous to myself. But recently 4 months ago i developed depersonalization disorder it is horrible since then I have started selfharming again just because nothing feels real i have no friends and just no one cares about me anymore. Ever since i turned 17 everyone has just left me to be an adult pretty much now i just do not feel ready. I have not even had a hug in 5 years let alone hang out with someone. If I am being quite honest here. I am thinking about taking my own life.My mental health has decreased massively especially with all the restrictions and constant reminders to wear masks and keep safe is just driving me insane.

14806,14826,Context. 22F. Recently got out of a longterm longdistance relationship. Got horny one night and went on one of those BDSM chatting websites. Started speaking to this guy. Had a great conversation. Decided to share a throwaway insta account. Started communicating about personal life. Found out we live a couple of miles apart. Met up for a date. Did nothing physical. I told him that I do not want a relationship. Decided to be friends. He knows almost everything about my life. I clearly told him that I do not want to be in a relationship. But he still kept pushing to the point of emotional manipulation. Eventually broke it off 2 weeks off officially no fighting just firmly. Now I feel bad and guilty about meeting someone on BDSM site and disgusted with myself. I do not know why I was ever okay with meeting someone on BDSM site. Idk I hate myself and I feel disgusted that I do not want to live anymore. How am I ever look at any one in the eye ever? How am I ever going to be in another relationship and not admit that I did something so stupid? How did I convince myself that it was a good idea? Why was I so dumb to meet him? Why should I live? Why do I deserve to live?,Suicidal

14465,14485,My ex of a few months more than a few months but we got back together started fucking around 6 months after our initial breakup but since they have found someone else and that has stopped all together. I am being ignored in fact. Anyway long story short every person I have ever dated has gotten married to the person right after me but this time this ex this one person i thought was my person even though they were terrible to me 75 of the time its different. I have self harmed over them in the past but i know as of right now if they end up marrying this new person they are seeing i will off myself. I will not be able to take it. Not this time. Maybe they have not changed and this is only short term for them but maybe it will turn out differently than our relationship did. I have spoke to my therapist about it and she had nothing to say except its an understandable fear. I want them to be happy. I want them to change for the better and not be alone but this is still hard. I am alone. I still love them with everything i have. I feel i always will. I do not want to kill myself to make him feel sorry or any other reason other than i will consider myself completely unloveable. Unworthy of someone wanting to spend their life with me as this has already happened to me 3 times i can count. This time though is the first time i was dead set on the person. I saw a future. I realistic one. One i wanted to live in. This all terrifies me. I feel like I am preparing for the inevitable. Fear of Ex marrying new partner,Suicidal

8401,8421,I feel like I am losing my mind now.I have been struggling with my mental health for almost six years now and have been having intense and recurring suicidal thoughts for 2 years.I am the only child of a single mother and me killing myself would absolutely ruin her to say the least.Last year I did two months of therapy because two months was really all my mum could afford.I have become so good at pretending to be fine that sometimes I think that I am lying to myself about being unstable. It makes me feel crazy.I live in a third world country where its illegal to try to commit suicide and where no one really gives a shit about mental health.The fact that I manage to do well in school and am ambitious while simultaneously constantly contemplating suicide would not make sense to those around me it does not even make sense to myself.I tried to kill myself last year during quarantine did not work obviously.I spent most of my time in therapy sorting through the damage left from my deadbeat father.Academic pressure is really high right now because I sit for my final exams in two semesters sounds like a while but its really not considering the amount of work Ill be having and revision Ill be doing.I cannot even begin to imagine how Ill cope with the stress once I go back to school in September I go to boarding school btw.I cannot do this anymore. I have tried so hard god I have tried so so hard. I feel so afraid so alone. I have nothing to hold onto anymore not God not the hope of a better future not the love I have for my mother. The thing is I have been in this dark place before more times than I can count. I never fail to relapse its like a broken record when you think the song is finally over it plays again. and again. and again. I am supposed to start an internship at a media house on Thursday. I wrote my application while I was still in school and told myself that I was going to be dead by the time I was supposed to start it. Here I am. A day to go. Ready to start my internship ready to die.Imagine being very deep underwater and trying to get to the surface. You say Ill hold my breath a little longer I am almost there You imagine being able to breathe again you cannot remember the last time you felt air come into you lungs. You keep swimming. Just a little longer just a little longer Until your arms get tired and you feel yourself sinking and the surface the longed for air becomes further and further out of your reach.

I struggle with acting normal with talking and interacting with people I could sit at my house in my bed for days even weeks and I would only want to sleep more.I do not like being around large groups of people.

Ever since the age of 13 I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime and even if I want to migrate I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections only to deduce thata my need for approval is making me unattractiveb I am not goodattractivesociable enough for women to take notice of me want meOf course nobody tells those to my face they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I too can see that this is all just a competition but some of us me included are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists how they talk about everyone is trying to get the best deal they can and you may be miserable as an 8 since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you. Dating is a market and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1 as a maleI know suicide if done right would be the same as falling asleep just not to wake up. I know painless ways and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled and mind you I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparentI am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way and things did not change I am considering suicide,Suicidal
14314,14334,I am tired of everything there is no joy in my life anymore and I feel empty emotionless and numb life is cruel and unforgiving and will kick you to your knees when you are at your lowest. I think I am going to finally do it today,Suicidal
14448,14468,Hi this is my first post on reddit and first of all sorry for any writing mistakes I am from Brazil and i think that here maybe would be a place where someone could understand me. So in february my gf broke up with me and we where about to get married them i was fired and i only had money to buy a PC to work from home and to live with her for a few months i did not get a job and the money was gone after that i get a bunch of Bank loans and my bill was like R140k this is like 27k in American dollars. All the money i get in the bank was for make her happy for all the pets that she wanted the food that she wanted to eat even when it was expensive. I really loved her and after that i just feel like i was just a thing for her. Since them my depression only gets worst and there is not a single day that i do not think of killing myself. I just do not know what to do anymore i tried everything to get better but in the end i just feel like nobody cares it is like people do not want you to die only for them do not feel bad with that but i feel they do not really care they just do not want to feel a burden when they are going to bed. Sorry for the giant text and for some mistakes in english. I just needed to talk about how i feel in a place where i could feel understood. I just do not know what to do anymore,Suicidal
26185,26205,I am in my 20s and my family is broke I am already 35kwhich is to only cover the first year idk how I am going to pay for next 3 yearsin debt as I will be starting university in a few months abroad. I am surrounded by fake and toxic friends.One of my good friend turned out to be a fake and a manipulator who constantly lied to me and used me for favours and I when I spoke up he denied it and all the other friends did not take my situation seriously so nth happened about it.I feel so dead that nth is going right in my life and nth is fair for me and nobody listens or brings justice to me.I constantly carry this pain in my head all the time probably due to stress and have pain in my abdomen due to anxiety attacksThe only reason I am still have not committed sucide is that I do not want to give up I know one day my life will turn around but I do not know how much long I can hold onto it. I am at the lowest point of my life and I do not know how much longer I can go on like this,Suicidal
8490,8510,I do not even know where to begin. I do not want to die but I do not want to be alive either. I have called and talked to someone on the suicide hotline twice this week. When she asked if I was suicidal I just started balling and crying saying I do not know. I know that people love me and I do not want to hurt anyone. I do not think I would actually act on anything. But its still difficult to have the constant battles in my head. Its hard to wake up and my chest hurts then continues to be heavy for the rest of the day. I have been trying to distract my mind. Be around those that love me. But God its so hard. I just cannot help but think what if I feel like this forever? I read a thread about people who left suicide notes behind and just scrolled and cried. I do not even know what I am asking for by posting this. All I know is its hard to feel like this everyday Lonely,Suicidal

23313,23333,I suffer from an incurable and poorly treated condition. People underestimate it then abandon me when they realize how bad it gets. Is it me? Is it something I did wrong? They tell me it is just too depressing to see someone get that sick so often with no way of easing it. That they did not know it was that bad. I am currently with someone that did the same thing in the beginning of the relationship. Underestimate it when after previous experiences I made sure I was extremely clear. He led me to believe he would protect me. Once again I ask him if it is something I am doing and he just said I should have known he was stupid when I made it clear in the beginning. That it was my fault for believing him. he is only interested in me now when he has a boner and I am severely depressed about it which makes me cold and he complains he does not get laid enough. Vicious cycle. But I am currently in the middle of a bad flare from my condition and can barely walk. I cannot go anywhere. I have to stay here and even if I did make it out I would end up in a homeless shelter. So I lay here now in the dark everyday terrified of my next attack about to run out of pto and will need to go on disability and that is a gamble tbh and the only person in my life that was committed to helping me is now terrified of my condition yet will still try to be present only if he has a boner. And if I move out I will not really have that much of a better life anyways. Fuck man. Fuck. I cannot even believe this is my life. I cannot believe how many shitty people exist in this world. Everyone is a mix of stupid and crazy and I have to rely on them to survive. I am so fucked. I am headed towards a mental breakdown.,Suicidal
25259,25279,I cannot keep my head straight. My thoughts control and irritate me more than usual. Complete isolation and not being to be myself when I step outside is finally getting to me. I feel physically and mentally sick. I have been going through this all alone for years on end. I am genuinely for the first time considering suicide. Every hardship every trauma every stressful moment I have had to deal and cope with all on my own. I just cannot do it anymore. This has gone on for way too long. I feel like I am done as an individual,Suicidal
11801,11821,I have only started realising that all my friends are leaving me. I had a large group full of good people and then I went and fucked everything up. They all seclude me except for my girlfriend who stays by my side and supports me. Even our closest mutual friend is avoiding us. She means the world to me and she is all i have now but tonight I made her cry. It was not my intent but that does not matter we went to the super market and back without saying a word to each other and Its all my fault. I love her to pieces but now I cab see I am pishing her away like everything else. I have never felt more alone in my life watching it peel away every good thing I ever had right in front of my eyes. I do not sleep very well and my anxiety spikes through the roof every now and then. Its all happened so fast and i know it will never stop. Nothing ever gets better so I am wondering if I should just end it now. Then hopefully my girlfriend will find someone else and move on from me. Maybe my family will forget me too. Nothing ahead,Suicidal
8911,8931,I just cannot take it I been pushed around mental health services being lied to and having my rights violated that certain actions were performedWhen they have not such as being told I went to a and e because I liked the attention also not having after care when I was Discharge from cahms having to wait 4 months before even referred to the adult team and having to wait 3 more months to wait.And being told after a particularly bad episode by the acute mental health team that I should just stop drinking then I was told that a consultant psychiatrist would decide whether I should sectioned but never heard back Then I was just dumped with more medication and having to be visited by the crisis team that I should just distract myself and just expected until to wait for threapy If I could anything without consequences I would fucking kill every single one of them condescending bustards for not giving me proper mental health care and expected to be cool with it The layer stopping me from killing myself is pain cannot stand being pushed around at different parts of the nhs and expected to be ok and deal with it,Suicidal
7788,7808,My boyfriend is convinced that I am his soulmate he brings it up at least twice a week. I would agree that I was meant to be with him except for one problem I am certain that I am going to snap and kms one day. I do love him and we do talk about our future together. It makes us both really happy but secretly I feel so guilty deep down because I know its very likely that all those dreams are going to come crashing down when I snap and decide to get it done once and for all. We did talk about having kids but I am afraid I will pass on my mental issues not sure if they are genetic or not because I was abused as a child for about a decade and also I would hate to create whole new people and then crush them by killing myself AFTER they are born. He keeps telling me that he will never be normal again if I do go ahead with it but I am so FUCKING EXHAUSTED. One failed attempt last year and I am still here on this shit earth. How can I help him? I would like to minimise emotional damage. We met on a dating app so maybe I could find him another gf or something. Or I could be such a bitch to him that he actually becomes happy at the thought of my death? Feeling GUILTY over potentially committing suicide how can I help boyfriend?,Suicidal

If anyone asks the shotgun is for selfdefense and in Oregon that should not raise any questions. Once I have got the gun I am going to drive out into the middle of nowhere Ill text a family member my coordinates load the shotgun put the barrel in my mouth at about a 45 degree angle to blow out my medulla oblongata then pull the trigger. It should be at least five minutes until an ambulance arrives long enough for me to bleed out if I do not die immediately. I do not plan on leaving a will behind or settling affairs beforehand because I will not be around to feel the aftershocks. Got an exit plan that I hope I can go through with,Suicidal

20061,20081,And I never will have anything. So what is the point?Lived a fairly normal happy childhood...until puberty hit. The severity of my mental illness has crippled my life since around the age of 12. I am now a 37 year old man who is frozen in time a constant state of teenage arrested development.I have no friends never had a girlfriend something I BADLY want and am incapable of doing work. I live on assistance. Tried every medication and doctorshrink at my disposal but considering how extreme my mental illness is the results have been tepid at best. I am stuck and I want out. I am so so so lonely. Every day is hell on earth for me. Please someone talk to me. I Have Nothing,Suicidal
10337,10357,To the me who dreamed of it all I am sorry buddy. I cannot really remember where it all went downhill but at least there were great memories made throughout this life. Alas I am at the end of the road. My guilt and shame grows day by day. My lack of motivation to do anything and everything. Not being able to contribute to society. Maybe I am taking the easy way out instead of working hard but oh well sucks to suck I guess. To this lovely world I bid you farewell. To all the lovely people be kind and be gentle. If the stars align and a miracle occurs maybe I will get to see everyone again P.S. Play Never in My Wildest Dreams by Dan Auerbach during my funeral thanks!

8109,8129,All this work all this pressure that everyone puts on you to succeed. To go to a good college get a good job the normal things a lot of parents ask. All for what? I work my entire life and then what? Am I supposed to enjoy my ofttimes from studying or working being an ugly socially awkward loser? Not able to talk to anyone have friends even when doing normally enjoyed things video games time off etc. all I can think about is how everyone else is probably enjoying their time with other people. Am I working for something or am I just working for the sake of working just because everyone tells me that is what I am supposed to do. Do people only tell you it gets better for the sake of having one more wage slave satisfy their demand for goods? What is this all for? All for what?,Suicidal
24357,24377,The first time I attemted suicide the pills I took were not enough. The second time eather. Now I have 15 prescribed pills left 0.25mg each of xannax.I kind of stole about 7 Halcion pills triazolam of 0.125mg And already drank about 2ml of clonazepam on dropslike 50 or 55 drops not a lot I have hope that that dosage will kill me but I have a little suspicion that they will not end up killing me just sleep me and be in peace for a couple hours. So please I beg can someone tell me how many more of each I need to collect so when I drink it all it will actually kill me? If not is there any other platform or subreddit I can go for help? Maybe if I mix it will alcohol? Would that help? I need help,Suicidal
11437,11457,Call me a psychopath but I have been fantasizing of killing my mom and maybe my little brother calling the cops and have them kill me. I know that sounds super deranged but that is an actual intrusive thought that invades my mind almost every single day. Everytime I go into the kitchen I see the big butcher knife and all I can think of is driving that thing straight into my mom's chest or sometimes into mine.I am really scared about what is happening. I really do not want to do that but the thought just keeps coming back to me. I am a 17F so my mind is still young so could the thoughts be normal? I am a very quiet introvert with only 2 close online friends I do not have irl friends and have been bullied a lot.Also my older brother passed away a few years ago and that really fucked me up. Could his death have triggered something in my brain? I do not want to tell my mom because I do not want to scare her and my severe social anxiety kind of prevents me from seeking help myself. I do not know if I am having suicidal thoughts,Suicidal

I was not in the thick of it until the tail end but we got him help in the end.I just think to myself if hes in as much pain as I am is it wrong for me to try and help? Sometimes I wonder if its the morally correct thing to not intervene. Ill always encourage someone to not. Sometimes I feel very selfish. I am too scared to do it so I do not want them to either. Maybe its a fear of being alone in my experiences.Idk. All I know is I am very tired. Maybe I am the bad guy for thinking this or for helping. Hope everyone has at least seen a photo of something nice today. Had to help talk a kid down from suicide last week,Suicidal

I am a 21 year old dude and I am writing this down just to express myself and just for the sake of distracting myself from this thoughts. i have been having this dark thoughts every now and then but they have been the only thing I only ever think about for the past few days. There are times when I actually think of doing the deed and when should I do it. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of my mom sobbing uncontrollably as they lower my grave down. Its just so hard to keep on going when you literally have no motivation to just keep on living. The only person that I can turn to is my mom since she is the only person who actually givesa shit about me everyone else just does not care or they pretend to care and then they talk shit behind my back.I just burst into tears as I am writing this down. I actually never had considered the fact that I would kept this shit inside for so long and and now that its out in the open everything just burst out. I have been trying out the hobbies that my mom's been suggesting but they only provide temprorary relief.To be completely honest writing down the stuff I have been feeling has helped a bit. I never thought I would use Reddit like this but I had to let it out somehow.

19776,19796,Married guy 35 with bipolar 2 ADHD major depression major anxiety I suspect I might also have autism. I also have several chronic medical issues that have me in a level of pain between a 7 and 10 on the daily. And I have started losing control of my ability to function lately. I cannot muster the energy to clean myself much less the house. I hurt all the time physically and mentally. Nothing brings me joy. I am on autopilot. I am constantly forgetting everything. My poor wife is basically my secretary making sure I take my meds go to my doctor appointments keep my own side business running etc. It just feels like the time to end it is drawing ever closer. Closeted new asexual and it has finally started to have an affect on my wife. My depression and anxiety just keeps dragging me further down the pit of despairso even if I wanted I could not perform. My anxiety and anger is getting to be too much. I can hardly concentrate at work and its starting to become a problem as well. I am seeing a therapist and taking meds but nothing seems to be working. And I am just making my wife miserable with my own wretched misery. I do not want to be alive anymore. I have thought about selling my stuff. I have googled the meds I take to see if an OD would kill me. I also own a gun and have access to sharp objects. The one thing keeping me from ending it is what it would do to my wife. Sure she would emotionally be ok after a while but she would lose the house would end up losing the business she is worked so hard to start. And she knows she is the only thread keeping me hanging on which just adds to her misery even more. Its almost like a catch 22. I do not know why I am here really. I am too much of a coward to actually do it. But I also do not have anyone I can tell my tale of oh woe is me.. I suppose the lack of energy is a good thing since it keeps me from working up the courage to actually do it. Feels like the time is drawing near,Suicidal

I HATE YOU MOM lt3 YOU ARE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I CUT MYSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EXISTING I hate my dad too he also makes me uncomfortable by making stupid comments about my cuts.

I am just surrounded by people who want to pay me to fuck. The problem is that I need money because my parents does not want to pay me for clothes and food so I will probably start this career even though I hate fucking and besides I am a lesbian so doing it with males makes me uncomfortable. that is another reason why I want to die I have become a whore who prostitutes herself to pay her lunch and her clothes and that cut herself to feel good.I became a human scum I want to commit suicide without suffering but I do not know how the fuck to do... is there a way?

17287,17307,I am done being me. I am ashamed to be me. Everyone I have ever loved is already dead or does not want me anymore. So why suffer in this misery any longer?And the things I am ashamed of are out of my control so there is no fixing it. I have already begun giving away my few belongings plan to donate the rest.

20532,20552,I have called the suicide hotline three times in my life. All three of those times though through no fault of the caller I have felt less listened to and heard than if I were to just ramble to my friends or internet strangers.'ActiveReflexive listening' is a good tool when people use it correctly but what I have been met with when calling has been the basic 'I hear ' or 'you sound '. Yes I appreciate your insight but I do not need to be told my feelings when I want to slit my wrists while listening to my favorite songs as I black out from loss of blood. Does anybody else have this problem of eyerolling when trying to seek help? I feel so selfish and frustrated at the same time. I have a therapist but manic depression prevents me from caring about my meetings. I force myself to log on put on a smile and try to be insightful about my problems until nobody's eyes are on me again and I can take off my mask of mental health again into the faceless being I seem to be identifying with more and more. I am just so tired of everything. I am tired of human interaction in general. I do not know how to keep my energy as it and most of my positivity ends up jumping ship as soon as it can. I am tired of putting on a strong face and of bottling up all of this overdue crying I do not let myself experience. Once upon a time I would have loved to hear a friendly 'everyone fucks up it will be okay' but now I do not want to hear anything. I want to lock myself up and stare at the ceiling. I want to impose prison time on myself so that I am less responsible for a life I do not care about. I do not want my corpse to be found. that is the most honest reason for not dying already. My family's reaction. My sister's disappointment when she is dealt with this as well. But I do just not want to wake up. I want a heat seeking one person disintegration missile comet type thing to just do its thing.I will probably call the hotline tonight and roll my eyes again. Pushing away positive changes as I always do. Ignoring things I do not want to hear. Pretending the past is not the curse tainting any chance at happiness because I was afraid to try. Taking solace in the fact that we all eventually disappear. Meanwhile browsing tiktok lives to get noticed by strangers and attain a slight bit of validation that will end up disappearing in the air like all of those exhales after smoking anything to numb my head and my body. I want to let myself cry but I am worried I will never stop at this point. I am alone. Truly. But we all are. Not sure of the point of this post now as the walls of dissociation come back up. Thank you for reading. Thank you for still breathing. Thank you for being a part of this community and being vulnerable. The Suicide Hotline and Other Selfish Rants,Suicidal
15797,15817,Too bad it is so scary. it should not be. everything i do is impure. these hands are tainted and disgustingampx200Bi would like people to just keep whatever they think of me now in their hearts because maintaining a living breathing human being especially one that is this fucked up and terrible is difficult. draining I want to be a memory of myself. existing is so painful.,Suicidal
21781,21801,My father killed himself in 2009. In 2010 I found a girl who loved me and saw me through the darkness.However I did not ever deal with my anger properly and 8 months ago she left me. She said it started with a reddit post I made 10 years ago about my lack of emotion that she found. Then once I was drunk and upset about an abortion 8 years ago.I found the lump back in August of 2020 and I did not want to tell her. I knew she was already done with me and did not want to disturb what we had left.It has taken over my testicle now. I have spent over a decade waiting for this I am so ready.should not take a lot longer now I guess it should be in my lymph nodes now or soon. I have tried therapy books and drugs. I have not felt joy since I met her but without her ther is not any happiness left in me.I cannot even have an accident because they would all know. This is perfect. Natural causes is what I needed. I am not am attention seeker I have never tried before and I would not actually do it. I have seen the damage suicide does first hand. I have lived it.I am happy that nobody will blame themselves. I am happy that I do not have to fake it for much longer.I am done. I can just wait it out now. The world really is great i just am not meant to be part of it.I am drunk I felt like putting this in text. I dunno why. I found a lump on my nut.,Suicidal
7370,7390,I am a 17 yo guy and I have been struggling with depression derealization and paranoia ever since I was 12. On top of that I now have GAD.I have been wanting to kill myself since I was 12 because at 12 yo I started having episodes of derealization caused by the paranoia that everything is a dream or fake.I have somewhat gotten over that but all that has been replaced by depression and anxiety which caused me to fail 2 years of school. I hate myself for letting that happen.When school is on every day I think of suicide and have really bad suicidal depressive mental breakdowns every night.Right now it is summer break but I cannot take all that pressure again. Sadly dropping out is not an option for me.I also hate myself because of my height. I am only 5'8172cm tall and I live in a country where the male average height is 5'11182cm. That makes me feel really inferior weak and pathetic because most guys I know are taller than me.I think I feel bad about my height because I am secretly competitive so I have been feeling my whole life like growing taller is a competition.Just for the record I am already in therapy and on antipsychotics and antidepressants. Also been in a psych ward 7 times. All that has not helped.Nothing helps. I think I am going to kill myself on the 31st of August. I think I am going to kill myself,Suicidal
10615,10635,That was the only thing I wanted. I just wanted true love.,Suicidal
8619,8639,I got psychotic episodes really hard schizophrenia type shit anxiety and depression.I cannot sleep I cannot eat and I have zero motivation the only way I have to cope with it is drugs. I have so much of them I have been on drugs 247 recently. I just want to be normal and not suffering all day long. I am just sad for my family and friends but its too much my brain is fried and I am only 19. I have a lot of oxycodone benzos and dissociatives I am thinking about taking all of it to have a chill death.I am thinking about writing a letter for my family so I will not have to deal with them while I am still alive.I am convinced that death is an amazing feeling because I have had near death experiences from mdma and stimulant use it was amazing I felt a reconforting feeling and all was love.I got too much childhood trauma from the time my mom died from cancer I do not even remember her voice and face... Anyway I am planning on doing it this week end I hope I will not miss.Fuck this world fuck my life fuck everything it is over. I am done with this shit,Suicidal
12317,12337,I am 13 and I have done some really bad things in my life and all this guilt is so suffocating I do not know what to do after that horrible decision I made back in April I cannot stop thinking about how much I deserve to die. I wish I could have been normal I wish i did normal things. To start at the beginning I was around 8 maybe younger. I would always hang out with a kid in my neighborhood and they taught me about things like porn and I definitely should not have learnt at that age but since than until like June I used to be obsessed about watching that stuff and I would watch different kinds I do not think I need to explain anymore. But I guess watching about one type influenced me and I got curious so I did something absolutely disgusting I made my dog lick me in the inappropriate place and that happened once more but that is all I never did it again because I knew it was bad and I felt so ashamed and disgusted with myself. When I was 11 I did try to attempt something like that and I forgive myself for that because it did not actually happen unlike it did back in April I cannot forgive myself for this. I am so disgusting. Even though I did other horrible things this might be the wrost and I cannot forgive myself. I do not deserve to be loved or even be happy. So many good things are happening in my life and I do not deserve any of it I deserve to die in the most painful way. Everyone would be so disappointed in me and now I am even more scared about what will happen in the afterlife for me if there is one. If I am being honest I just want to stab myself like millions of times out of hatred and disgust. All I am is a disgusting rapist. I have no reason to live anymore I should have lived my life better. I am a horrible and a disgusting person.,Suicidal
12273,12293,i tied a blanket around my neck and pulled it really tight but my head began pounding and it went on for over 10 seconds so i decided it was too long and loosened it. i did this again but same thing head pounding and nausea. does this even count as one since i was pulling the blanket tight with both hands and if i did pass out id probably just wake up again due to it loosening? does this count as a suicide attempt,Suicidal
37293,37290,damn i really do hate myself,Suicidal
22633,22653,that is all I got to say. The heat over here from the summer has been intense and I just want to kill myself already. I feel so fucking empty and I do not have the balls nor the money to speak to a therapist. Fucking hell it is all falling apart around me. Maybe my death with be far more interesting than my fucking life.,Suicidal
21923,21943,I have always been told if I committed suicide Id go to hell that is the only thing keeping me here its bullshit we are just created then expected to live in this shut hole? Its bullshit I hate everyone in my life I let them walk over me and then when I finally snap they act all surprised and then I am the enemy. Everyone just thinks I am a hollow npc to use as a punching bag and then when they get called out they always get people to defend them but whenever its me who gets called out suddenly its open field day on me. Like when you all cry so do I when you get pissed and want to scream so do fucking I I am a human being you dumb cunts. Contrary to popular beliefs I am not a fucking comic relief character in some damn series I am not going to be the butt of all your stupid ass jokes. I hate the fact that I cannot kill myself,Suicidal
18708,18728,I cannot stop thinking about it I want to die so badly I just want an easy painless deathI should just climb up next to a power lineI'll be goneEverything will be better without meI will not have to feel like this anymoreI will not have to exist anymoreWhat's stopping me?

12377,12397,I have been at home the past year... quite literally not doing anything. And that is the only way I am able to cope with how terrible I feel. I feel hopeless and am just alive to exist because it is so hard to find joy in anything. I do not want to kms but I do not want to exist either. But the fact that I have to go work just to stay alive and keep suffering just... idk man it is horrible and I do not see myself doing it. Any opinions or advice? How is one able to perform at work or school when one feels so miserable all the time.,Suicidal
37345,37342,why am i so weak that i cant keep up besides its not my new jobs fault thati amfeeling this way so why should i punish them by going on a leaveim supposed to be better than this at this pointi am so terrified of taking stress leave that nowi amstarting to be convinced killing myself is the only option my doctor has me on meds probably because i am crazy i dont know i dont have any friends either or a family support net so dont with that friend shit and all i have is my boyfriend to talk to but this isnt his problem i wont saddle him with my weakness i am a shit person i deserve this,Suicidal
10329,10349,I do not know what I am trying to gain by writing this but I have come to the point where it feels like killing myself would finally bring me calm and peace. I am a 34M married a father of a 1YO boy with a stable job albeit not the career I wanted at all and despite all that I have been fighting demons that I feel are now starting to overcome me. I have been an anxious insecure and depressed person most of my life. I have had dreams and aspirations but somehow I have convinced myself that I do not deserve them or that I should just put them aside to help make sure my familywife would have a good life and a good career. Despite all that I could lead a decent life graduate high school finish my military service as a combat medic successfully and even get a Ba and M.A. However ever since my son was born I have been powerless against my anxieties. I feel like I cannot protect him from anything be it a minor cold or something else. Like I am always waiting for something horrible to happen to him. Like many other kids he was sick during his first year and he still does now and then but I feel like I cannot control it cannot protect and that he will spiral out of control nonstop coming in and out of illness I cannot defend or treat him against. it is gotten to the point where I feel like I am cursing him with my bad thoughts about his health making him sick because as my wife says Our thoughts make the reality we live in. I feel like I am always prophesizing about another illness he will have even though thank god he is a cure happy and healthy baby aside from the occasional colds and other shit little kids constantly get. Even though I know that most parents deal with this and tend to their children and move on I feel like this is consuming me to the point where I am convinced that by dying I will finally be free of this pain and anxiety and can finally be calm and maybe happy. I do not want to kill myself but I am going back to thinking about it too often. I am afraid I might break very soon and leave my family without a father and with a huge scar. I cannot stand myself anymore. I need help and I cannot seem to find solace anywhere. I do not want to leave my kid without a father but I cannot live like this anymore. A new father on the verge of losing it and ending it,Suicidal

15661,15681,I am so tired no matter how much i try and better myself or challenge myself my thoughts always just come back to this. I will not ever be happy in this world and how it is now. Everything is a chore everyday is pressure. I am from the UK so i cannot get hold of a gun which would solve everything. Why is not there a good option for us to end it all if we do not want to be here? I do not want it anymore,Suicidal
18265,18285,If I walk out onto oncoming traffic would it be my fault if someone hits me? They can swerve. I am sick of cleaning up shit and living in a nasty old ass house built in 1930 where I feel its going to collapse on me or Ill die from mold poisoning. Everything is harder when things are cheaply made. How is it fair for others to charge expensively. I feel I deserve better than this. But who fucking knows why we suffer everyday for damn Eve who is so fucking stupid and bite the damn apple. Deception is so easy its so horrible. is I want to kill myself but the only thing stopping me is God. This world is so unkind and cruel. People are getting more fucked up in the heads that even men think they are women. Your own family can treat you bad. Worse things happen to people that are unimaginable . I want to kill my self but I am too scared to. I wish I could die now I want to die I am so unhappy,Suicidal
27301,27321,Is it climate change? Is it the rising housing prices? Is it my worthless brain? Is it to pay bills with money I do not have from jobs I cannot keep? Is it to be alone forever each day growing further apart from my friends amp family? Is it watching my family grow older and older and dying and having to take care of them? Is it working for any reason and having your savings stolen by your parent? Is it living with repressed childhood trauma and untreated ADHD for my entire life? Is it constantly getting my hopes up about a job or college and then quitting after one week? Is it laying in bed wanting to just sleep until I am dead?Jesus H fucking Christ. No good comes from my being alive. it is JUST suffering. Never any happiness never any success never any connections with anyone never any sympathy or accomodations for living with multiple disabilities nothing.Anyone who says I ought to deal with any one of these things and not just off myself over it is a fucking moron who gets off on the idea of saving lives. it is really disgusting to me. Oh why do not you prolong your suffering for me? I like to watch sick things have a slow and miserable death. that is all any of these sick fucks are really saying. Fuck them. Honest to God what reason do I have to be alive?,Suicidal
23081,23101,Not a single day has gone by without me thinking about the what ifs and my mistakes. I have tried all the steps to move on but I keep relapsing and it hurts so bad everytime. I am so stuck I do not want to move on. Chasing a girl who does not want you. I just cannot figure it out. I do not even want help anymore. I am almost out of school and its been fucked trying to imagine a future without the what ifs. I have failed myself. Its so sad because I have so many good things but the memories will not stop. I cannot sleep anymore because my brain is overwhelmed. I just want to be there for her and I cannot. I cannot even do that. Might attempt again tonight as I failed last time. I can remember every single mistake I have made all the way since grade 4. I keep wanting to go back to relive them. I do not want to stop thinking about her or moving on. I have tried for so long and I cannot do it anymore! I cannot! Why cannot I move on?,Suicidal
20699,20719,Last night I was tired of living and ingested about 200mg of second gen antihistamines. This morning I felt next to nothing so I consumed another 500mg of them. I have not felt the effects yet but it feels liberating to know that if this does not work I can just overdose on ibuprofen or something. Am I wrong for feeling this happy? I just attempted suicide,Suicidal
16578,16598,I just needed to vent. I have been relatively fine by which I mean not actively planning although have had issues with EDs and SH since my suicide attempt when I was 16 just over two years ago. I was sorting through all my books to move them to another book case and a little flashcard fell out of one which turns out to be a suicide note I wrote to my girlfriend now ex a couple weeks before I attempted.It completely stopped me in my tracks. After just staring at it I had to get up and turn off my music. I have just been staring into space for the last 20 minutes.do not get me wrong this is not triggering me into wanting to commit again in fact quite the opposite but I feel emotionally broken. I had already found some other triggering items from the same time period but this was just too muchThe worst thing is that I do not even remember writing it I had no idea this existed until now. Its short only a few sentences long as I clearly did not know what to say. It just breaks my heart that I was in that place mentally and I can genuinely handonheart say that I am glad my attempt did not work. Not because life is easy now but because the balance has shifted to more good days than bad through a shit ton of hard work meds and therapy. And it is worth that fight even despite feeling hopeless at the time. Idek if this belongs here but I just needed to talk to someone. Sending well wishes to anyone who may be reading this. Just found my suicide note from 2 years ago,Suicidal
23173,23193,I am at a point where I am on the road to a mental breakdown. I really wish I had the courage to end it but I know Ill never go through with it because I have a 2 year old son.It started four years ago when I was in an abusive situation with a guy who was much older than me I was so in love but now I realize he was a narcissist. One night he said something degrading and I decided to leave but instead he assaulted me. No one believed me not even the police. I later found out that this well put together person had had other restraining orders against him and had been in prison for eight years. That was shocking. Anyway I developed PTSD.The year following this I started drinking heavily on the weekends to forget. I also exercised a ton and lost a lot of weight. that is when I met the father of my son. I thought he was a great guy and he treated me so well that I let my guard down. I was so scared of having sex but I did it. I told him about my sexual assault and was understanding. I found out I was 5 weeks pregnant. I also found out that week that he had a girlfriend whom moved down two months after I discovered my pregnancy. That made my PTSD spiral out of control. I regained composure and was thankful that I was pregnant and made it my mission to have a great pregnancy. Quite frankly I never want to date again nor do I miss sex. My main goal is to be a mother. Well my little boy is two and I beginning to suspect he has autism and its taking a toll on me. Not only am I having suicidal ideation because of this issue but the assault issue is coming up and I keep thinking about it. I also have a lot of resentment toward my sons father for not helping him through this trying time. He knew I was pregnant and could care less what happens to his son. Hes never seen him and he even blocked me. Anyway I just needed to get this off my chest. I wish I had the courage to end it but I do not. I really should have ended it four years ago. I would not exist and my son would not either so neither he or I would be suffering so much. Single parent and suicidal ideation,Suicidal
9193,9213,I cannot even cry anymore. I feel utterly worthless. I do not have an appetite anymore all I can ever do is sleep and I cannot bring myself to do the things I usually enjoy. I might as well have the help hotline on speed dial how much I call. The world is better off without me and I without it. I am constantly crying out for help to no avail. Why do I even try anymore?

6985,7005,It sounds quite stupid I know. For the last couple of days I have prepared everything I need I will not bring the details but it is a very elaborate plan except one a note. I started brainstorming and drafting what is useless and what is not decided whether to post or write by hand and checked for grammar. But I felt like even my last piece of writing however short was not good enough. Nothing I do is ever good enough. that is how it has always been. I want to perfect something in my life and end myself in a grand finale. Yet I do not know. Perhaps I can give it another few days. Today is a new one. I am planning to end it all but as a writer I keep editing my suicide note,Suicidal

I have always wanted to be a mother but i would only be a bad one. I am a bad sister bad daughter bad girlfriend bad friend. everyone learns to hate me. all ill ever be is a dumb girl who cannot appreciate what she has and wants to die. I am putting others through pain every day i live. the only calm i get is cutting myself open and watching the blood. i do not care about myself. i only care about others. but others can handle themselves. i cannot handle myself. i was not made to be here. whatever weak sperm reached the egg first was defective and should not have made it there. my brain hurts me i hurt myself i hurt others. its always been this way. there is no amount of childhood trauma i can blame this on anymore. i just cannot keep doing this. I am not going to live on for 5 minutes of happiness every few months. i cannot do this anymore. nobody cares to see my tears nobody cares to see my pain so why should i care. it would be so easy to just end it all and never come back. i would do it right now but i cannot mess up this trip. my final selfish act. i really really need help please,Suicidal

Vivo con mi familia a quienes no consigo hacer entender que mi idea de suicidarme es algo que me tomo en serio ya lo dije varias veces y no toque ms el tema. ltimamente la frustracin conmigo mismo es demasiado estuve medicado un tiempo pero ODIO con todo mi ser como esos frmacos me dejan en un estado letargico otros no me hacen nada. Ac en mi pas exactamente en la pequea ciudad donde vivo no existen medios de atencin a casos como el mio solo sanatorios y hospitales que no tratan casos como el mio no tengo DINERO parte de mis problemas para costear un tratamiento.Estoy elaborando un plan para desaparecer busque un puenteviaducto muy alto que varios cientos de metros debajo est lleno de malesa y creo no es posible que recuperen mi cuerpo.No har notas ni videos de despedida por el contrario estoy poco a poco des hacindome de fotos y elementos que me identifiquen no tengo telfono no hablo con amigos no salgo de casa borre ya hace muchos meses la mayora de fotos digitales y pienso destrur los lbumes familiares documentos y todo aquello que hable de mi paso por este mundo. estoy exactamente a un mes de cumplir mis 35 y la verdad no quiero pensar en que sern ms. La frustracin hace que mi ansiedad se haga insoportable el paso del tiempo es un tormentoSi alguien tiene alguna sugerencia para desaparecer mi cuerpo yo borrar rastros de mi muerte me gustara leerlos.

21858,21878,I have had cancer currently have 2 chronic pain conditions that because daily pain and I am not able to work right now. I have thought multiple times about tapping out because I am so tired of the pain but I have not because of my husband and my elderly parents. I have also always said if I did do it Id do it on my birthday so that there would not be multiple days a year that people have to think about me. Well my husband of 18 years has decided hes done with me and our marriage and my birthday is coming up in 2 weeks. If I can just make it past my birthday I know I have to make it another year but right now 2 weeks seems impossible. Just 2 more weeks,Suicidal
24293,24313,Is it because of depression??? Probably. Do I have a plan?? Nope.Dreaming of running away and trying to pretend I do not exist for a year. Or dying somehow but that seems like so much effort at this point I suck at it apparently. I just need to be away from people.Society makes me feel like I have no value so fuck society. I hate these humans who walk around like zombies oblivious to anything that is not them or does not concern them. People do not care about anything but their own wants and needs even if it fucks over others. it is disgusting. I am a hypocrite for saying it I will admit I have done bad things in my past when I was blissfully oblivious too. But consciously knowing feeling it all... Just too much. I hate it and all the things this world has been made into and I would rather die than be sucked into the filth of it any more. Sigh. Rant over? Quitting my job. Overwhelmed.,Suicidal

I have come to a point where I no longer want to live because I just cannot enjoy life I am just waiting slowly for the day when my time to rest come. I wish at least my boyfriend would care about me... But apparently I am not important enough... Not even to my family or friends... If there is no one for me then I do not want to be here anymore. I cannot control me...,Suicidal

14163,14183,I cannot remember the last time I felt content with life. I am on two antidepressants just to get through the day and it barely gets me up in the morning. Every disappointmentset back in life feels ten times as heavy when you are already at rock bottom. I do not feel joy in life just small moments of laughter or jaded hope. I am really trying to come out of it all but I just keep getting hit over and over and over again. It looks like Ill be losing my job today. To top it off the manager talked to me with complete disgust on his face. I am so tired of feeling dehumanized. People say you can reach out and talk to them whenever but they are never there. Even the people who mean well do not fully understand. What they meant by tell me your problems is you telling them how much better you are doing and then changing the topic and putting the focus on them. They do not actually give a shit about you and your legitimate problems they just want to hear how great everything is while you are drowning. DO NOT mention if you are feeling suicidal then they look at you like you are a crazed monster! It is selfish and I do not talk to those people anymore. Which has created an even lonelier existence but at least I do not have people looking down on me for trying to survive. I like reading the posts here because you guys truly understand the pain of it all. The only place I feel heard. let us keep trying our best its all we can do. So tired,Suicidal
15081,15101,When I was younger I was always told that suicide was a cowardly decision. At first it shot through my heart because it made me feel bad for feeling bad but now I just scoff at that idea. it is not a cowardly decision. If it was a cowardly decision then I would be dead. I am a huge pussy and every time I get close to making a suicide attempt wheater it is me about to kick the chair with a rope around my neck or not swallowing a fist full of pills I end up hesitating wussing out and not going through.it is like my body pulls me back when I try and it is so taxing when your mind wants you dead and your body does not cooperate. I know this cannot be an unfamiliar occurrence because our bodies do everything they can to make us live. Sure I have attempted a couple of times by hanging but that was only because I slipped and the rope and fixture broke.If I had a gun then I could just take a breath count to ten and take the pain away but I do not. Even then I probably would not even be able to put the gun in my head or mouth anyways. Maybe one day I will stop being a pussy and do it but not tonight. If suicide is a cowardly decision then why am I still here?,Suicidal

18383,18403,About 4 years I did some acid for the first time. I remember it not being super crazy probably did not take enough. Did a tab with a couple friends and all of us just felt like smoking weed for the first time plus a little of hallucinations with the popcorn ceiling. One thing that stood out to me was a thought that humans are just biding our time here on Earth or something close to that. It was a very clear thought and gave me hope for anything after death for the first time. Maybe ever? I do not think I was suicidal then. Not really anyway. The thinking about death a lot part but not making any plans. Maybe a year or so after and for the past 5 years or so it has been off and on suicidal thoughtsplans. I guess my question is whether anyone else has thought about this before or after having suicidal thoughts. Or if you have had high thoughts that help you. Its a very small comfort to me. That if I decide to do it there is something else that is worth waiting for. Acid thought.,Suicidal
15869,15889,Disclaimer This is going to be lengthy.For some context my gf of 6 years and broke up about 3 weeks ago. I am 23 and we have been dating since we were in high school graduated college in May. I was her first and only bf and she broke up with me because she was showing interest in someone else and did not want to hurt me. She was also concerned about my mental health if she were to end it I have had what feels like depression since I was about 14. At first I thought I was handling things well after the initial days of crying and depression. I started working on new skills exercising more and I started going to therapy only been to two sessions so far. I am not sure what caused such a downward spiral but it started after my second therapy session. My therapist wanted to do a joint session with my ex and I so I could get some clarity on where we stand. Basically ended in we are friends but she wants to explore while I still want to be with her. I kept my composure throughout the session but after she left my room we live together until next week I could not hold it in anymore. I blasted music and cried my eyes out for about 20 minutes. Since then I have been having dreams about her every night. Some include the guy she is interested in if you are familiar with GTA RP we are all in the same server and some are just my mind trying to pretend like nothing happened. that is been going on for the past 4 days now and I basically wake up crying every day. My mind keeps hurling insults at me and I hear you should just fucking die repeatedly in my head every day. I do not want to think these things. I do not want to have hatred for someone who does not deserve it. I basically have no friends. The group of friends I play games with every day are all related to my ex in some way her little brother her cousin's bf. I have not even spoken to a girl since before we started dating. I am antisocial and cannot even keep up a conversation with others. I can only distract myself sometimes when I play with the group or play some games on my own. Even then I start feeling the pain again.I am in so much pain and I do not know what to do. I am all alone and there is no one to save me from myself now. I am scared. I want the pain to stop...,Suicidal

21027,21047,Like wow. I think of suicide everyday for the past year. Half that year was chronic suicidal thoughts. I am talking with a plan what the aftermath of my death will be like how others will react etc.Recently I decided I wanted end my suffering. I went online and bought the drug do not ask. It arrived. I have it in my hands its easy access. All it takes is a little and I will not even know I am dead. Thinking to myself wow its that easy huh? And then I am dead which makes my suffering no longer existent. Everything is fine now. But no its much more hard than that. You have the permanent solution in the palm of your hands all you have to do is take it and your desire is MET. So much power is held in my hand right now that I can finally make this decision. It all came down to this moment. I came to realize I do not want to die I just want to end my suffering. Looking at this drug in my hand gives me fear anxiety worry so many different emotions that just looking at it makes me feel uneasy. What is it that I want best for me? I feel that I have no choice but to take this dark route as a only solution. It feels impulsive to have bought this. But why must it feel like this is a choice now? Why could have I of just for once realized this is not the answer. But it does feel like one at the same time. Its all too conflicting. It gives me comfort knowing I have access to it but when do I decide to take it? How do I prevent myself if I had enough of living? Have I really had enough? What is enough? I am not even working towards something so why am I here? Just to suffer more because people tell me to stay? what is the answer I am still deciding. Why does it have to be this way I do not know. Thinking of suicide and a plan is like a walk through a park. When presented with the permanent solution in the palm of your hands it becomes the most difficult thing ever to commit to.,Suicidal

My second and final request is that you cremate me and scatter my ashes in Banff National Park. Goodby I am done,Suicidal
27121,27141,it is like talking into a wall. I briefly mention that I just got done crying over someone and I am having a really bad day? It gets ignored. I get ignored. I could be crying under my blanket around my family and no one suspects a thing. They just carry on like usual. I cannot tell people how bad I really feel without feeling like I am going to get ignored again. I sometimes vent on Instagram and does anyone care? No but they did at some point. I sound like a broken record everytime I vent because no one heard me vent about the same thing the first time. I fucking hate feeling alone. I always give obvious hints that I am not doing okay and no one has ever checked up on me.,Suicidal

22793,22813,Understand that I am not seeking attention.Understand when I say that I am in pain.Understand when I say that I am not feeling well.Understand that my mental illness is real. And that it is eating me up from the inside.Understand that you can not help me by criticizing my actions.Understand that I need you to say that you are there and that it will be okay. And that is all.do not make fun of me. do not make jokes about my mental illness. Not even the most subtle ones.Understand me. Especially when I try REALLY hard to explain.I do not expect you to understand what is in my mind without me speaking a word about it. I do not believe in fairytale love stories. do not cook for me do not buy me gifts do not give me surprises. do not try to make me smile all the time. But.. Give me my freedom. do not patronize me. do not think you know me better than I know myself. do not think you always know what is better for me than I know what is. I know you mean well and that you love me. But.. You lack respect. You lack the humility. You are in denial. You make me hate you and you make me hate myself all the more everyday!And that is why it would probably never work out between us.And that is why I might finally make that jump.

18468,18488,I am so tired of fighting these demons attacking my soul. My neck and chest feel suffocated by bad energies. My mind is a wasteland. I feel like a waste of space . So low vibration. Dead and dark inside yet still around and moving. I feel like I sold my soul and got nothing in return. My heart is dead and smothered in darkness. I question is this even all worth it. Why is this existence so cruel. Or maybe I completely deserve this. Maybe I am a failed creation. I feel worn out. Why do I continue this fight. I am not even mad at anyone or anything anymore. I just feel so distraught from this life I have lived. I do not want to die but I really want to rest. Everywhere I go people ask me If I am ok and if I am just tired. I am tired of telling everyone I am tired. I am dying inside and nobody can help. Even if I tried to kill myself i would not know what to do. I am just stuck 20yo thinking about suicide.

Think the day I am finally forced out I will write a letter apologizing to the few people i care about and leave them my things. I got nothing left to live for. Hell i never really had anything to live. I want to apologize to the kind people here who have left encouraging words. Maybe it kept me going but facing homelessness is too much.

20450,20470,I feel like I have posted this before a while ago but idk I just want it out of me. I have been suicidal for about 9 months now. I know how I am ending it I have got some notes and I have a time frame sometime after this year is over to when I hit 30 in a few years. For as much as I have been told I am fortunate or good I just do not deserve any of it. I am trash I am worthless and I always have been. Nothing more than a foolish and desperate boy trying to prove he is not garbage by doing whatever he can to be proud of himself. And he never will be. Shutting everyone is compliments out because they make my brain ache from the conflict of what they say and what I know. Id just rather end it than live in agony or disappoint everyone anymore. I have vowed to enjoy what I can for the next few years get better at making it seem like I am happy that I am pulling out of this temporary depression that is been around for years. I have got plans for the next year or two of my life but who knows if Ill be around long enough to see them through? I sure do not. Idk I just want it off my chest.

17010,17030,When I was barely over the age of one cps took me away from my birth mom. Needless to say I was found in a terrible state. The very first family to take me in as a foster child eventually they were able to adopt me when I was 3. Sadly though I was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years I was a foster child which was ultimately detrimental in how I ended up. Luckily it was a closed adoption sadly though the parents who had adopted me had divorced a few years later. My mom got me and the other kids while occasionally we would see our dad. Though my mother would rarely let me see my father.It was obvious from the start I was different from other kids. I look back on it and I realize just how much of a struggle I had to deal with. I attended special classes for my speech impediment I was always getting bad grades and I just did not understand ANYTHING. Instead of getting me help my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. I just recently found out that she knew I always had ADD but never told me. She would ground me for not crying when someone I did not love would die. I was always getting grounded and I was never allowed inside the house. No matter how hydrated I would get she would not allow me inside and she worked me like a slave. Only ever cleaning when I was inside.Eventually I ended up living with my dad and his new wife when I became a teen. I ended up getting caught having sex and my father who was extremely strict grounded me for years. I started getting treated like I was a dirty person and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. And to this day I am still treated like this. What more I went back and forth between my mom and dad eventually I was kicked out before I could graduate and have struggled ever since. I always struggled with depression but as soon as I became an adult I started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. I started coming out to my family who I have Always had a rocky relationship with and was always shut down and told to stick it up.They ignored my pain and suffering and I refused to ever ask help from any of them. But my sister would always have my back she would make sure I would not be homeless. And now I just find myself in a rut. I am in the first relationship I have had for years and its terrible. He deceived me into believing he was someone else and like an idiot I feel for it. he is made us get into tremendous debt and now I find myself the lowest I could ever be. I have no motivation and I know I just cannot keep doing it anymore. I am tired and I do not care to live. I do not care what happens after this I just want to be set free from this misery.I have come to realize that all the abuse I went through as a child has damaged me in a way that I can never hope to be normal. I still have a speech impediment but I have learned to become the silent character. I know that I have some form of autism I have looked up all the signs and I have worked so hard to understand myself. I do not want to be here anymore and I guess really I just want to be heard.

12030,12050,Almost everything is looking up in my life. I just graduated as a nurse got hired at a wonderful facility before I even passed my State Board exam... I have impressed my boss lady enough to get a raise already. Some residents are already saying they love me. I am kicking ass as a nurse so far especially a new one. But I am lonely. I am bisexual but I lean towards liking women more.Some coworkers suggested dating apps. I unfortunately booted up Grindr and it will not stop blowing up. Only a handful of lukewarmly attractive women swiped right on me on Tindr... I am really not ugly or anything but despite having great facial bone structure I guess I am virtually worthless in the eyes of the fairer sex? I will have a blast with another guy in the bedroom when I am trashed.. but.. I want the company of a female and I guess I am not good enough.I may be bi but I am not marrying a disgusting man. If I am too ugly to ever find a wife I might as well terminate this experiment. My patients will get used to another nurse. Probably one with six pack abs so women will not hate them. I just want to know what a good firearm to end my existence is before I become an actual Incel. If only I would been born a female the sex society actually cares about. Men are worthless. I am one of them. Many people of both sexes adore me but I am apparently not good enough for your typical woman. Have fun with a 6 pack ab packing criminal father. You do not deserve the familial decency I grew up with. You asked for this. you are on your own. Bye sluts! Your stankyass vaginas CRAVE men who can barely spell.

26398,26418,Got out of a relationship of 8 years. My lady lied to me that she was talking to someone else. I had to find out through an accidental picture from her. She told me she wasted the last 8 years of her life. Every step of the way she makes me feel lower than dirt to save her own guilt ridden mind. This woman could not care less. I have already attempted twice this past week and she could not care less. My family and friends give me generic words like it will get better with time. What if I do not want to spend my time feeling like utter shit? I drive up and down the freeway an hour both ways to find a friend to hang with but no ones available.

21916,21936,I am less than two months from going to graduate school and yet I have never been closer to committing suicide. I have the majority of a plan in place and everything. If I make it to grad school I have two years of that and then an internship to start my job which I can do pretty much anywhere in the country. It feels so far away. It feels like it will never happen. Even in high school I told myself to look forward that college will be better. It was not I spent my days laying in bed or working. Now I am afraid grad school is going to be the same loneliness and isolation so much that I am fully prepared to end it before then. Why does life take so long to get started? Why is the ticket to true happiness and selfdetermination so elusive? Why does the tunnel to happiness keep going endlessly?,Suicidal

12285,12305,Several months ago I went through a terrible breakup of a 412 year relationship. I lost the person that knew more about me than anyone including my parents. I had to move back in with them and it was rough. For a few months we tried taking a break where I was not allowed to contact her unless it was something we both planned. Right off the bat she told me that she just wanted to break up but was also curious to see where things went.ampx200BAfter two months of listening to all of the fun she was having without me and her starting to find excuses to back out of everything I decided it was time to end it. Regretfully it was over the phone but I do not know if I had a choice because she would agree to meet and back out at the last minute.ampx200BI was suicidal for a long time after that. Like not eating for several days at a time looking for any websites with information about how to commit suicide and even going places to get supplies. I lost about 20 lbs in just over a month because of this. I constantly reminded myself of everything that my ex told me was wrong with me and every mistake I made in the relationship. This was the person who knew me the best and they thought so terribly of me so I took it to mean that was who I am.ampx200BI started going on long aimless drive to get out and try to find something. Several times I ended up in the city my ex and I had lived in. Our lease did not end for another month so I stopped by the apartment once after she said she had moved. My head was thinking of all the good memories I had with her there and told me to go so I did. But actually being there was completely different. She still had random items all over the apartment and she still had a few of her collages there but all of my pictures were removed. A letter that I wrote to her shortly after the breakup was laying in a pile of junk mail on the couch.ampx200BAfter seeing all of this I made my first suicide attempt. I tried hanging myself but I stopped because that shit's uncomfortable. I tried calling a few friends but they were busy and could not talk. I did not know what to do so I just drove back to my parent's and locked myself in my room.ampx200BI decided I might as well do everything that I can to find something in life so I started traveling. I did a family vacation that went terribly because everything's uncomfortable around my parents now. I visited a few friends and that was a really good time. I honestly felt great for the first time in a long while.ampx200BAfter about a month of that I found a new apartment in the city where my ex and I lived because I am still going to school there. It was really difficult at first to be here and see all of the places we would go just a few months ago but that slowly wore off and now it is just mildly difficult. First week I am here I see my ex pulling into the same parking lot that I am leaving. I decide to go visit a friend to get out of town and end up running into her mom. Then two weeks later I saw her going out with the guy that she said was just a school friend.ampx200BI was feeling great and not thinking much about suicide but now it is starting to come back. I have thought about it almost everyday this week. I think about jumping into traffic when I am on a walk driving my car into the river on my way home giving myself alcohol poisoning or just starving myself. But I just do not know anymore. I feel like I have this drive to just keep going and meet someone else and live a dream life but at the same time I know I am not hard working smart or wealthy enough to get any of those dreams. I feel like it would create too much drama too.ampx200BThanks for reading this. I am sorry for how long and rambling it is I just needed to vent. I do not know what to do anymore,Suicidal

12613,12633,I tried hanging myself when I was 16. The rope broke. I fell down on my face drunk and in tears. The pain was unbearable and I felt like nobody in the world could help me.I am now 20 years old. I took a lot of advice from different people I respected I was dealing with very serious family issues that were more or less pushed onto my lap since mental illness runs in my family and I suppose people thought I was good for something at the time.I understand now this disease has no cure. Ill always be a hostage to my own mind and a punching bag for everyone else. I do not believe in God but I pray he gives me some stronger rope this time. Good luck guys. Much love. Slipping back into suicidal thoughts after 4 years.,Suicidal
13185,13205,I have found the perfect most successful place. A well known place for the success and fatalities. I am going there tomorrow. I am excited. I will be face to face with this shit. I will be looking at it feeling it. Maybe it will scare me so much knowing I could fall to my death so easily knowing so many have succeeded. Maybe I will just hurl myself off and think nothing of it. Time will tell tomorrow. No one personal or close to me will know where I am driving to tomorrow. This is exciting for me. Because now I am withdrawing from everyone no one will even notice I have been gone. 24 hours.... 24 days.... 24 years. I think I am ready. I do not want this pain anymore. The MHT have failed me. I have probably failed them. Crisis planning is too fucking late Got deleted so posting it here if people actually give a fuck lol,Suicidal
13946,13966,Its just weird. I cannot seem to end my life for nothing and you have people offing theirselves because someone left them or something embarrassing. Forgive me if i come off as downplaying other feelings its just...what have to happen to me in order for it to end all. I have no body. Nobody likes me. Every day I am humiliated and insulted whether i hear it or not. I am the worst most sickest kind of person in the world mentally. Why must i keep being tortured by living when i want to go? It bothers me so much. I sleep outside but i wonder how people who is going through less can successfully end it all and i cannot no matter what I do. I guess I am too broke to even end it.,Suicidal
21138,21158,My girlfriend 36 and I 28 are very in love we do everything together and I am afraid she will kill herself once I am gone.We were about to move to Hawaii and get married there but unfortunately I was diagnosed with the most painful condition on earth Trigeminal Neuralgia and TMJ a year ago. Unfortunately there is no cure and I am in agonizing pain most of the time. I am bedridden shaking kicking crying and screaming. My pain is 10 out of 10. it is like getting tortured in a basement somewhere and getting my head bashed in with a sledgehammer on a daily basis.This is my life now and I do not want it.I am still trying to convince her to let me go but it is not easy. I think she is kind of ignoring the situation and she believes everything will go back to normal soon.she is planning the move to Hawaii while I am planning for my own death.I am still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my body and mind will get erased from reality for ever and it is fucking with my mind really hard.I would have loved to spend a few more years with this amazing girl I had plans to travel the world and do amazing things with her but I guess the universe had other plans for me.I am very concerned for my girlfriend's wellbeing. I have a feeling she will go completely insane once I am gone.it is going to be very hard on her as we have been together 247 for quite some time now. we are inseparable.I want to make this transition as easy as possible for her.

10611,10631,I have social anxiety and depression so weddings are not my scene. One of my close friends from college just got married to another college friend of mine and I was a groomsman. The wedding was lovely and I am happy for them both. But god do I hate everything about weddings. I do not have and never have had a romantic relationship or anything close to it. Unsurprisingly then weddings make me feel even more alone and unlovable and worthless. But I also hate the reception. I do not dance because I am overwhelmed by anxiety at the thought. So initially I tried to stay off to the side at this wedding. Unfortunately I felt that by not dancing I was even more noticeable. Eventually I went and took some xanax to calm myself down. Once it started kicking in I was feeling good and actually started dancing with the rest of the wedding party. And i had fun. Why is this bad you might ask? Because it showed me how my mental illness was holding me back from enjoying life. I cannot take strong drugs like xanax often it is for emergencies only. This makes me want to try recreational drugs which I know I should not do and are illegal in my state.So here I am. Back home feeling worthless lonely and suicidal somewhat disassociated from reality. Fuck me. I cannot kill myself because I cannot bring myself to do that to my parents.The good news I that I only have a lot more weddings in the future because all my friends are getting married. Fml I hate weddings,Suicidal
14584,14604,Every day i do my best to think things will get better. Hope for what you see in others to be good and true. Purpose to be given to everything.

17837,17857,I feel the world is very bleak and my personal future seems bleak even though I live comfortably with every convenience within my reach and in a first world country etc. I would not call this depression as I feel extremely lucid and clear thinking despite experiencing lethargy regularly I believe this is due to working nights rather than my mental state. I want to prosper but also kind of do not really see the point at the same time. It all feels pointless and wasteful continuing my life of mostly just meaningless consumerism. The internet reminds me how bleak the world is regularly. I guess I do have too much screen time. I am pursuing selfimprovement and long term goals but at the same time regularly think about throwing myself off a particular cliff that I know of in my country my ideal spot. I picture this regularly. Some terrible things have happened are happening to me lately including my 2 closest relatives getting seriously ill likely cancer one recurring cancer and one cancer in an organ which has been weakened over time from other serious illness someone died in front of me at work while I was holding his hand and talking to him my partner's mother died my old family dog is dying I was bullied at my job I hate my job I have no clear alternative to my current job I am not happy with my appearance I have been pursuing plastic surgery but also think this is pointless and a waste of money materials and resourcesampx200BSorry for the ramble. I will probably delete this but I am curious about what a reaction would be like. Have had regular suicidal thoughts for around two years and they are increasing in regularity,Suicidal
11721,11741,My home could not be anything further than an environment I am happy to live in. Sadly majority of my siblings have now moved out and the pressure is constantly on me to do things in and out of the house. Since 2016 I have felt depressed but its getting to the point where I do not want to be here anymore. I say it to myself every time but what is the point of living if you are living for someone else... well that is how it feels I feel like I am constantly slaving for my certain members of my family having to worry about what they want to eat for dinner and helping them with their clothes washing etc. Its so draining and I have tried to explain this to my Mom but she just puts up with it and does not care about how I feel. I am sick and tired of having to do this every day. I just want to get out but sadly feel like the only way is through marriage. Its affecting my health quite badly I have become unfit and out of shape as I never get to look after myself and I am in my early 20s. I have been so strong for a lot of years but I am getting to the point where I feel like if you are in this much pain every day then what is the point anymore? Can anyone point me in the right direction or give me some guidance on what to do.. I also graduated recently and can do a masters maybe moving away would do me some good. Your home is your sanctuary,Suicidal

I remember once when I felt something different I am not even sure what it was but it was so weird and strange it did not last long though. I do not know why my emotions are like this right now I am sad. I do remember having happy moments in my life but I just cannot feel that emotion anymore.

7978,7998,So I have been diagnosed with panic disorder severe depression and I also have horrible anger issues that just make me feel like shit afterwards. For a few years now my depression and anger have taken a bad fucking turn. it is gotten so bad that I have been pounding brick walls and getting into fights as a form of self harmpunishment stupid I know but it also keeps the anger in check.About four months ago I stopped taking my meds I mean they barely helped me anyway. No one really knows what is been going on with me and I think that is for the best. I am about to start college in about a month and I am extremely tempted to kill myself before then.Days just blure together and the faces of friends start to lose their meaning. I honestly feel like I am out of options at this point and I do not know what to do. I wish the best for everyone that reads this but I do not believe that anything good is in the cards for me. My only constant emotions are rage and utter sadness and no amount of support can change that.,Suicidal
25396,25416,I posted this before butNow I am really fed up with it. The last time I was angry now I am just spiteful. Hateful. You will get through it you will get stronger you will see it is going to be ok. Yeah? Well maybe I am tired of always getting through shit. Maybe I am done always overpowerering shit. Maybe for once I want a thing that I actually care about to go right. I have so... idk what is the word? unmany things that I care about left and even those always go wring for me. Always. No matter what I do. Yeah looking back 10 years later and saying damn I really got over it is cool. But you know what other kind of cool I would like to experiment for once in my life? Enjoying the actual thing not just fucking it up and then getting over it. Maybe in 10 years I want to laugh because I actually did the thing because I lived it and I enjoyed it. I want to laugh at the memories not smile because I accepted failure consciously buried that thing deep inside and moved on. Bottom line is I just wish for things that I actually care about to go right at least once in a while and actually enjoy life not just accumulate experience and regret over the years. I want to live while I am young. Is that too much to ask for? Is it really that much? I am sick and tired of life experience and always getting through things,Suicidal
26577,26597,Absolutely everything in my life is absolute garbage and it is never going to get better. I am getting absolutely zero quality out of life.

I do not really want to share my past but I have been abused by my dad got bullied in school for my looks and as of middle school me and my moms relationship started to degrade to the point of I really do not care how they are affect by me if I do commit suicide. Due to this I have been playing more games to try and get rid of this thought but ig I only suppresed the feeling. I think about what I want to do in the future and I cannot think of what I want to do no matter how hard I try.

Everyday is just another day for me to wonder wtf am I doing with my life my family thinks I am in college but I dropped out a long time ago. It feels like I am reaching the end.

Basically spent almost two years on my couch.. I almost gave up on my professional life because I felt I was not good enough and that my colleagues were nasty. Now my relationship of 5 years is crumbling apart and I do not have the strength to fight for it as I did. The only thing that comes to my mind is disappearing and I do not know how to deal with it.

14634,14654,I do not even know what to write i just feel very sad angry and frustrated about the limitations of my very small brain. I have always been the stupider of the group and since i was a kid people always have made fun of my intelligence. My family the friends i used to have the teachers and pretty much everyone that had the displeasure of knowing me they all naturally converged to the acknowledgement of my own stupidity i do not even know if this sentence makes sense in english... if not i am sorry about my poor english.. I am actually surprised i somehow managed to live for 24 years but i hope that soon my stupidity will succeed in what it is supposed to succeed kill the bearer of the bad genes. But you know i am too stupid for that like i am too stupid for many others things. In the shitty life i lived I have always had to confront with my very limited intelligence every single time i tried to do something. I used to love history but i had to give up because my brain could not afford to retains all that informations i used to love playing piano but i had to give up because my brain could not afford the ability to perform polyrhythms i used to love drawing but had to give up because perspective was too complicated for my brain to be handled... I could go on with a very long list of things i tried to do but miserably failed because of my very low iq. Because that is what is all about in the end. And no i do not have any learning disability or other related issues i am just a plain and simple stupid person with a pitifully low iq. Cognitively speaking i probably perform on a Forrest Gump's level how am i supposed to fairly compete with all the normal people? I just cannot. Everything seems out of my reach and even the littlest things you all do without thinking they all require me an enormous amount of cognitive resources and i still manage to fail. How the hell am i supposed to find a job if i am too stupid to acquire the skills that are required for it? With the small brain i have i would have hard time with the simplest of the job that pays minimum wage... Do you think is that a life worth to living? Even if i miraculously manage to find a job do you think it is worth to live a life where you are too stupid to enjoy your passions? Where you cannot understand how the hell works the world you are living in? Should i just go on with money and just forget how unlucky i was at birth? Should i just accept a life of complete ignorance? I am so frustrated right now because even after 1 hour of writing i still cannot properly communicate what it feels to be stupid and probably this is the best way to describe it you just cannot do nothing. You just cannot. I am too stupid to live.,Suicidal
7519,7539,I am scared of how they will react if I tried to kill myself. Like would they be angry at me or themselves. Would they be sad. I do not know. I wish I had another reason though. Literally anything. A pet. Something. I do not know My parents are the only thing keeping me alive,Suicidal

I have wanted to kill myself since i was 12 I have nothing to live for and everyday is the same. People have always told me that it will get better only makes it worse by saying those empty words. I am not seeking help here its too late for that. This is more of a last goodbye.This is the only thing that could make the pain go away. Goodbye. Its too late for me.,Suicidal

Will i do it when i get in jail. I sleep outside. I do everything one can to end it all but I am cursed to keep living.,Suicidal
7559,7579,Apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense I am feeling emotional and I am also a bit high...I have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks have a history of attempts and I think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until I 'do' something about them i.e. try to off myself. And today I have been seriously considering doing it again and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right dog would be taken care of and I had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. But ambivalence.So...my dilemma is that if I am rational enough to think that I should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital ER then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself so then why am I even at the ER? But if I do not take myself there it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should I or should not I' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong which is not necessarily any time soon based on recent history or I am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. And I know I would just fail again. And I cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.I know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal so I am not asking whether you think I should go to the hospital or not but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? I usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since I went to ER and I am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. I do not want to feel like a moron telling them I am there because I do not want to kill myself and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. I already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like I need them to connect me with that resource. But going it alone when I am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. ampx200BTLDR when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it what did you do? How did it work out? Need thoughts on going to the ER or not,Suicidal
8493,8513,Soo umm i am a 15 year old studying in 11th I know its pretty young and was wondering what to do..I actually am pretty confused what to do I am not afraid to die but even if i die someday i wish it to be quick. After surfing through internet and much more I came to a realization that only studies matter in this world..If you cannot study your life can never be secure and you will face hardships. The constant nagging from parents to study and them always pointing out faults criticising us...My parents are actually good it is just that on studies things happen.. they do not beat me but those petty fights and unknowingly pressurising meI many a times get lecture from them about how important is future and why i need to work hard for the upcoming years. The fact is that i know it pretty well but i cannot find the motivation in doing it.. I love my family a lot it is just that I am sorry its very complicated to explain I do not even know why i am writing this post. I am just unsure what to do I do not want to commit suicide or anything as i know it will devastate the family and i also have a little brother whose life i do not want to ruin by dying I change topics very quickly as you can see by reading this post Its just like i do not know my true feelings..my true selfI am not able to concentrate right now and just umm never mindmy mind is going wobble Uncertain About Life,Suicidal
24282,24302,7.7.21Should I kill myself?A long journal entry that mulls over the idea of suicide why I was born why I continue to live when its so easy to die and why I am holding on even though most days I think about killing myself at minimum 48 times.I am tired of being around everyone that I loveI no longer find joy in the things I once cared for and in general I am becoming a very bitter mean person to be around.I was not always like this though once upon a time I was just a small child who did not choose to be born and I was busy dealing with an insane woman who would punch me in the head if the sky was the wrong shade of blueShe did not think she was doing anything wrong because kids in other countries had so much less than we didShe never took the time to teach us about these things because she was too busy yelling and avoiding being with us as much as humanly possibleBut I digressRecently I have been lucky enough to find someone who loves me and somehow I feel like I am fucking that up all the time tooHe does not know how sad I am on the inside because I do not trust him enough to tell himThats not on him I just have never told anyone about the monster that lives in my heartIts always there just slightly off in the distance waiting for me to come and fall into its dark and comforting embrace and phwoo its getting really hard not to wander over there and just fall off that cliffI tell you what boy there is absolutely nothing like the darknessI have been there before and it is comforting let me tell you whatBeing alive is hard being in a relationship is hard dealing with the world and hoping for people to get better is hardBut the darkness? Holy shit no one talks to me in the darkness.No on interrupts me in the darkness no one tells me my ideas are wrong or that the things I talk about will never workNo one can hurt you in the darkness no one except yourselfDamn what a choice.What a fucking choice.I am just sitting around being in pain all the time and what your supposed to do is go to therapy But I have been to therapy I have seen those peopleI was little sitting in offices talking about how I was being abused and no one helped me then so how am I supposed to trust these people to help me now?I do not fucking trust anybody no one.Not a doctor not an expert in a field not the people close to meYou cannot trust people because people are fucking insanos.My mother threw me down a cement staircase because she was mad that I ran away from home because I was afraid of her doing something craxy like oh I do not know throwing me down a cement staircaseMy dad fucking walked out told me he was going to be with his new family because being with me was too difficult and then showed up almost 8 years later to let me know I was a failure and I was not trying hard enoughBecause I was lying about my grades because all the people in my house were abusive and terrible people. But he dint know that because he had again been gone for about 8 years.So I digress but if these two DNA donors cannot be trusted how the fuck am I supposed to trust anyone elseThe only person I ever trusted my grandma is long since dead.And honestly I have a harder time every day keeping myself alive instead of killing myself and going to hang out with herLike people spend their whole lives thinking they will go to paradise they will go to heaven. They put all their faith in people that live in the fucking sky.I met my grandma bitch I know she was real.I remember her rubbing my back with an egg to take all the pain away and here my dumbass is 10 fucking years later with 10 years of pain built up in my back and my soul and my heart because I do not have anyone to rub an egg on me anymore to make me feel betterSo what the fuck manHow do I keep goingHow am I supposed to keep walking this walk when all the time I look outside and I just want to go nope and throw myself off the roofLike I am supposed to be worried about people missing me I guarantee you everyone will be just fucking fine if I am goneLike everyone close to me at this point has only known me for 35 years definatly not long enough to give more than 2 shits about 2 months after I am deadSo yeah. I am having a reeeeeeeeeeeeeeallly hard time finding reasons to stay aliveLike for what?So I can watch everyone I love succumb to the disastrous effects of climate change? So I can die in a climate disaster?So I can die of some insano disease that I do not have any money for?Nah man fuck thatSuicide is the one time you can go hey fuck you! and just fuck offMan being alive is so painful. Like all day I am just sad and worried and I am supposed to just act like everything is fucking ok and its not fucking ok and I am tired of acting like its all fucking okThe world is literally on fire people are murdering children everywhere and I am stuck in butt fuck suburbia being sad all day long trying to finish my English homework which takes way more effort than it should at this point in my lifeSo I do not know what the fuck man I cannot even tell anyone that I feel sad or else everyone is going to start worrying and freaking out and its like damn can I feel my fucking feelings? Can I talk about the world being a piece of shit and just one person go yeah you are right now what can we do? and I do not feel so fucking crazy all the timeLike how do some people have so many friends and I cannot get anyone to be my friend and talk with me and agree with me on any of this shitI feel like I am going insane like its just me watching the world slowly implode while people are just going into work like everythings fine and we should not be paying attention to thingsI just feel so low so pessimistic so sad and so heartbrokenBut people say do not lose hope and I got to say to those people you can go fuck yourselvesLike you keep being hopefull in this shitty ass world I am done boyIm feeling like the darkness is just where I belongI do not have any kids any family any anything that is enough to make the darkness go awayIts just aways been there waiting for me to just lay in it and go to sleepAnd with the way the world is right now I do not see a reason why I should not do just that at this pointI do not want to live anymore.I am just so exhausted with being alive with being a person with being around other peopleI just want to scream that everything is no ok but no one listens to meI always feel so ignored like my ideas are so uncomfortable and no one wants to deal with itAnd it makes me furious because the truth isint an easy thing to deal with but it needs to be doneAnd no one wants to do it so why should I stay here?Why should not I risk it all on the off chance that I die and my grandma is there waiting for me with that egg?Pwhoooooooooooooooooooo I am having a rough one todayI just want my grandmaI do not care about anything else anymoreIm just a tired little girl who would like some affection from her grandmother the only person who made her feel safe and loved and cherished in a way that I have never felt since her deathI wish there was still someone around who loved me for me who listened to me but that is gone nowNow I am stuck here on this dumbass planet with these insano people and I am just supposed to do this and contribut to this terrible broken piece of shit ass system for the rest of howeverFuck that man I am out 7.7.21,Suicidal

25044,25064,I was very very sad and down earlier now I am happy and I feel cathartic seeing all these suicide notes. I am scared to comment my positivity with what they want to do because I might get banned or something... I am okay with dying since forever I am still having a teeny weeny problem with pain but suffocation does seem promising. My only problems are computers and technology I still want to see where they are going to go next and I want to prove my respective society's stupid ass system by rising to the top then maybe stage the best suicide ever like burning or maybe gunshot to the head while wearing a classy rich man's suit. I hate school man. My parents' resolutions with not always pushing me to be the 1st at everything now does not really help with things since this stupidass distance learning that has the small fine print it might be they just do not tell me what is the point of that anyway parents are always obliged to enroll you anyway of requiring an internet connection because they do not just send you all the papers and selflearning modules the most stupid thing ever its like what even is the point of teachers and sometimes send it through social media which i usually do not ever check because i only use it for talking to family or friends and i usually do not talk that much to them and i do not have that many friends its usually long silent times then a burst of longwinded messages... I end up with a bunch of modules I never knew even existed. I just really fricking hate school man I am going to flunk for no reason other than you did not put it in front of me to notice it or at least notified me that you sent me something. They really should have canceled the school year. Id rather be a bit older than normal but got my smarts from learning than still be young but have a rushed learning. I fricking hate school.TLDRKill me do not I am full of despair but I am somehow still full of hope. I really want to die not but three problems ? Pain tolerance Want to see where cool stuff like technology goes moving forward and I want to rise to the top and either destroy everything or destroy everything and rebuilding it how it logically should be like how school will work. Why??,Suicidal
14977,14997,I am on vacation. It was a fine vacation I guess. Lots went wrong but I guess it was fine. I had a full on breakdown last night into this morning because I cannot go back to my workplace. they are so abusive and do not care about me even though they claim to be my friends. They literally admit to my face that they are the worst to me and that they know why my mental health is so bad and then say well fuck you still. I said I needed one last positive day on our trip I was going to go work on my resume and start applying for jobs while I waited at the airport. Instead of a good day we got completely rained out. Like the water is up to my ankles and our last day in a Disney park ended up a complete mess. I left things for us to do today and we got to do none of them. It literally could not have gone worse. I think its just a sign from above saying you cannot have this day its not going to get better so accept it and do what you have wanted to do. I needed the day to go well for any motivation that things could get better and instead the whole day is ruined. A sign from above that I am not wanted here anymore,Suicidal
16196,16216,I have been very active here recently but having somewhere to vent somewhere where I do not feel alone makes the feeling alot easier on me I guess. This is not entirely related to the post I just wanted to express my appreciation for this subreddit. Its helped me alot.That being said I just saw a post on here someone talking about being snapped out of it because they realized how much it would hurt their kid and it made me think about why I have not done it yet.My two brothers. One older than me and one younger than me. The older one tells me all the time that when I was born it snapped him out of suicide. His attempts were stopped by me crying as a baby or even when I annoyed him he still loved me and wanted to stick around to see me happy or even just to annoy me. My younger brother has never expressed the desire to kill himself to me before like I did to my older brother brother but I have similar reasons. Truthfully I like to fuck with him. Sometimes the funniest part of my day is me walking into his room flicking his forehead and walking out. he is one of the funniest people I know and I know my death would ruin him. I have two sisters neither if them are super in my life so I do not know for sure how my death would impact them but it helps to think they would be devastated too. I have a niece. she is a year and 7 months old and she is the cutest thing to exist. She cannot talk but I love my moments of communication with her. We play games together even though she cannot speak. Some sort of variation of simon says where she waves her arms and claps her hands wanting me to copy her. Sometimes she will turn of the tv when I am watching and look at me and laugh at me. Sometimes she does things and when I tell her to stop she looks at me and does it anyway. I want to see her grow up. she is so smart right now and I love how she is right now and I want to see her get older and I want to tell her stories about right now and show her videos of how she liked to just fuck with her aunt or how she would kiss her reflection.Sometimes this does not work. Sometimes I relish in the feeling that if I did commit suicide right now people would be devastated. Sometimes I feel like that is the only time I will be loved by everyone unconditionally and I feel like at my funeral when it finally sets in everyone will realize what they did wrong and feel remorse. Sometimes I think that if I died right now maybe in the afterlife I will have everything I want including what makes me happy now. Maybe if I just did it I could have my cake and eat it too.This is a hard reason to have because sometimes its my reason for wanting to kill myself and sometimes its my reason for staying alive. I want a better reason. I wish this was not my only reason but its kept me here for 9 years. Maybe if I had a better reason the 9 years would finally be over and I could just live and be happy but for now I guess it will do. I wish I could find a better reason but if it works it works I guess.,Suicidal
9928,9948,I am at the fucking end i can not and want not to live anymore. Sometimes i laugh and be happy but that is just for short times because i do not realise the sadness when i am fake happy but i constantly have suicidal thoughts and often they are very strong. I think and plan for the last few weeks and constantly search for a good way for suicide but i think my perfectionism and ocd is the only reason because i do not find a worthy way to die. I am the person that searches for help but then does not accept it. I do not know what i should do i just want to dissappear in peace. being happy is like borrowing happiness and paying with sadness,Suicidal
7868,7888,I do not want to be dead I just do not want to live in this world. I love being conscious and being able to experience existence but this world has thrown nothing but pain at me time and time again. Life here is so mundane and unfulfilling. Its such a sick joke. I wish I did not have to waste away here. I want the freedom to live a life that I was meant to. I am constantly thinking that if I die here maybe Ill be able to start anew in a different world. But there is no way for me to know. I might just cease to exist. I can accept this but I do not know it its worth putting my family and friends through such a heavy loss. I do not want to fade away. I do not want to stop existing. But I also do not want to stay here. I wish I could just go where I was meant to go. I want to live a life of my own image. Please. Someone help me. I do not want to cease to exist I just want a new life,Suicidal

16180,16200,I am currently the most depressed I have ever been and super super suicidal. Long story short my mental health has just been steadily declining through the pandemic and I am at the point where I am trying desperately to get into some type of treatment facility. Getting evaluated by a psych on Monday. I also started Zoloft 5 weeks ago and am at the point where its only made me worse. But I am just trying to tough it out for a week or so more bc I know it could turn around and really do not want to have suffered through the past month for nothing. I am not going to hurt myself but I am so so suicidal and cannot stop thinking about killing myself because of how depressed I am. I know I am beginning to take steps but nothing can really be done that quickly and I just need these thoughts to quiet down a little in the mean time. I am just so fucking tired and really wish I could disappear. The only thing that makes it better is weed but that is relegated to the night time as I have temporarily moved back home and my family is keeping a close eye on me. I think they would judge if they saw me smoking in the afternoon. Its really really hard for me to do anything because I am so depressed so activity based remedies are difficult. I am basically at the point where I do not mind disassociating because everything feels so painful most of the time and it kind of numbs me. Please help. Tired,Suicidal
12603,12623,I have been struggling for many years with depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Now I am at an all time low and i cannot take this anymore. Everyday is the same i have no energy for a single thing people around me keep telling me that there is so much to live for but i cannot see that in my dark place and it has not gotten better in years. The thoughts of ending my life and writing goodbye letters kind of give me peace. But other thoughts just keep flooding my brain and it is too exhausting to take it any longer..Maybe someone can relate. I do not want to kill myself but i want to die,Suicidal
26608,26628,I feel like I have been losing support recently and I take that as a sign that I should stop resisting suicide.I talk a lot on a mental health support forum. It seems whenever I talk about my breakup almost relationship I do not get a very good response.I selfharmed the other day after being unusually upset about seeing my ex. I saidgtIf I got any worse plan was to call an ambulance to the store but there was noone at work that I trusted.This guy saidgtSo next time you are triggered by seeing your ex what is your plan for dealing with it in a healthy way instead?Another person suggested that I was not actually dehydrated it was just psychological stress. Kind of hard to believe.He said that I am responsible for my own reactions and that I should not call her my ex. He apparently calls his own ex the mother of my children.I feel like people cannot imagine what I have been going through. I have never been in a real relationship before. Noone who tries to help me can understand what that is like.I am so much more hopeless than even people who have committed suicide... so why would I fight it?TLDR Title. When did you stop talking about your thoughts?,Suicidal
8529,8549,Now no one love me and need me. it is all my fault I always mad lazy and being an asshole to everyone. The last person that love me is now hating on me after a fight. Now I am unloved and I deserve it I should never exist in this world. Worth it,Suicidal
9777,9797,I M20 had to end things with my girlfriend F20 of 1 year. She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something it would have been way easier to move on because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her we even said I love you to each other. We truly loved each other we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together I would really feel like I would lose her forever the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore movies video games exercise nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys and even though I know she is not that kind of girl it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her it would finally kill me.The worst part is I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back and she has her own life somewhere else now it really cannot happen at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen and I keep telling myself that but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TLDR I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do. I cannot move on from my ex and it is killing me inside,Suicidal

17815,17835,This year has been the worst ever in my life. eLearning has changed my life in the worst way possible. I am even more introverted than I was previously. Back in April one of my close friends was even diagnosed with depression. In February and March my teachers were punishing us for our bad behavior even though I was not part of the group of people who caused them. In May one of my teachers called me a politician who lies because I was running for Student Council President in my school. How come I respect others yet I do not get the respect back? I have felt depressed and lonely since the beginning of this year and I am losing hope in the future. Making new friends is impossible since my parents get mad when I make online friends because apparently all of them are pedos and that they will kidnap me or something. Covid has not helped either. My friends are like Things will get better but after hearing that many times things 100 have not gotten any better. Why do I deserve this? What have I done to deserve being depressed? If I died everyone would care for like a week then everyone will have forgotten my existence. do not have an easy way to kill myself either. Maybe drowning or no water could work. Honestly if I could choose the option of killing myself without any pain then I would choose that. Why continue suffering through this pain any longer? Why is my life going downhill?,Suicidal

11821,11841,Searching is not a cry for help. This new practice of tech companies creates more stigma and increases feelings of isolation. Also the National Suicide Prevention hotline hangs up on people all the time. Failing that people who feel like they have no place to go are immediately met with the same after school special cliches their friends and families would kick out. That is not help or hope. It is ridiculous and inhumane that there is no pathway to communicate with people who look at suicide in a rational and open way. It is never framed around the person in pain. It is always about the repercussions of their actions which removes the agency of the person considering such an act and casts them as a mere accessory or novelty in the lives of others. The fact that I cannot use the word suicide in any search engine or social media site without being bombarded with antisuicide propaganda is oppressive,Suicidal

20914,20934,I am a caregiver for my mom and I have helped her since I was 12. I want to help her because I know she cannot do stuff alone but I cannot take a day off. there is always something I have to do and I am exhausted. I do love her but I just cannot take it anymore. My therapist suggested moving out since I am 18 but I just cannot. I feel selfish and feel like there is no reason to move out. Also I know if I move out my mom will find me so we can amend things. My therapist and I have tried to find ways for services but she cannot get on them because of social security points or money. I have been trying to fix the relationship but I feel like there is always something wrong. Not on her but me. If I do not do this I am selfish. If I take a break or want to do something I feel like I could be cleaning this or helping her with that. We argue because I am not cleaning this now or doing this later. I am tired. I have told her many times I want help but for some reason she always wants help from boyfriends. I do not care anymore but anytime I try to find a solution all it leads me to is killing myself. I feel hopeless and I just want a break. My therapist said if she should help me move out or find a way to feel better about this and I do not know what to do. I do not want to move out but I do not feel like I could feel better about the situation I am in. I am sorry if I am all over the place but i did not want to make this post any longer. I just want to get away from everything,Suicidal
11424,11444,I should say at the outset that I am a survivor of 20 years of suicidal ideation. Please do not accuse me of making light of this subject I have a right to. As I believe everyone does if they do it with love but that is another story.My motivations are as follows1. Expose the ridiculousness that is as inherent in suicide as it is in every action. 2. Replace upsetting brainworms actual plans with scenarios which scratch the itch but are also amusing or distracting or are calming because they are obviously fantasy. I have seen this approach taken without the above reasoning made explicit in an old blog I came across once. The only one I can remember is from a standing start drive your head fullspeed at the pavement. It could have been considered a hateful site I guess but I do not think it came from that place and I found it hilarious and calming.Please share the most hilarious and fucked up suicide methods that have occurred to you. Ill start with one that recurs to me. I would not wish it on another who never thinks of suicide but for anyone that does I hope that it occurs to you in a bad moment to bring you humour and remind you that you are not alone.So here is my funniest suicide methodHanging via bungee cord in front of a train. The train hits and any remains left attached to the stretched rope are comedically pinged back in the opposite direction disappearing from view near the end of their arc.I know that this would not work and I know that train drivers deserve better. Realism and empathy with hypothetical characters are not the point here ok? If its that shit write a better one and that can be my comedy suicide brainworm Funny suicide methods?,Suicidal
27160,27180,I have been thinking about it and likely going to try finding a dealer to buy it from since Los Angeles definitely has drugs. My future just is not feasible because of student loan debt and the expenses of rent and I am not sure if I can even join the military to start a new life due to my 5150 years ago.I would like someone to talk to. Suicide hotline is really just there to ensure you do not kill yourself in the there and now. Suicide by Fentanyl,Suicidal
14236,14256,Hey you all. I read through this subreddit all the time looking for motivation? Or hope? Or I am not sure but I cannot keep waking up everyday feeling like this. Not for 5 more hours and surely not for 50 more years. I currently work two jobs one full time one part time I average 6072 hours a week. I am 21 and burnt the fuck out. So this is where the cycle begins let me take you through my thought process. I work two jobs so I can be closer to financial stability yea? So I can have the funds to save money AND afford my basic living needs as well as recreational wants usually weed and concerts. Not too many clothes or fast food etc. I just do not feel like this is a way to live.I am tired my mental health is collapsing. I have no hobbies because I do not stick with anything I start. Usually that is because I realize hey there is no way to make money doing X. Which means leaving a job to pursue a passion might be me shooting myself in the foot when hours drop at my main job they usually drop for everyone in Q1 but that is 3 months that I would only be averaging 2430 hours instead of 40 and that is a lot of money to someone living paycheck to paycheck. Why am I so worried about money? Because we live in a world where if you do not know what 60000 piece of paper you want to go for at the age of 18 then you are already at a disadvantage. I am trying to find a healthy balance of realism and optimism but whenever I go to older people for advice they just say you are young. This is the world your eyes will open to more and you might not like what you see.When I was 19 I worked 72 hours a week 5 days a week and the other 2 days I was enrolled in community college for 18 credit hours. I had no days off. My days off I had school work. That only lasted a few months before my grades collapsed and I ended up in the hospital for a suicide attempt. I feel like I am stuck in a cycle of WANTING to feel good about myself actually starting to feel good then life happens and I am worried about money. In the past 7 months I have switched medications and psychiatrists twice been diagnosed with an STD gotten fired because a job did not realize they hired me at 20 instead of 21 had my motorcycle stolen lost my AC in my car my apartment flooded last week and I had to have fans in my apartment for a full week which was annoying as I work 16 hour days and at the end of a long day I would barely be able to sleep in my loud freezing cold apartment. I try not to downplay my truth even if it is not as painful or awful as others because this is the life I have to live. I cannot compare my suffering to others to make myself feel better. And I know I do not have to live on my own going home would save money but at this point my mental health is so shit that I feel like my independence is all I have. Take away my apartment and my car I have nothing to work for. Nothing to live for. Yes I have loving friends and family but what is the point in being alive if it is for everyone and everything BUT me. What is wrong with me? At this point I am not even sure if it is an actual chemical imbalance or if I am just waking up to the fact that this is real life most humans cannot move up the ladder and if I cannot control my reaction properly I will not enjoy my next 50 years on this planet. I am so tired of feeling like my shitty mental health is so profitable that I am not meant to feel good in this life. My boyfriend and bestfriend are so worried because they do not think they can provide the help I need. I have been to psychiatric wards and our mental healthcare in America is a fucking joke. I wish crying in my car was an Olympic sport because I breakdown every other fucking week. I just cannot keep feeling like this. With all these overwhelming thoughts of the future and not being able to forgive myself for the past.Not for 5 more hours. And surely not for 50 more years. stuck in a neverending loop of feeling inadequate because that is how I amwe are meant to feel 21f,Suicidal

10353,10373,What happens if you change your mind half way through a drug over dose ? Can you just make yourself sick and be okay ? I am not in my home country and plan this on the 28th I cannot go to the hospital and be on a psych hold as I have to travel on the 30th ideally I just do it and then I am gone. How long does it take to kick in ideally want to take as many pills at once Overdose,Suicidal
16306,16326,I have been depressed since middle school but aside from short bursts its always been manageable and rarely suicidal. These last few months I have spiraled like crazy. Once every other week I call in sick to work because I do not see the point in making money that will not make me feel any better my friends have all pushed me away to arms length because my mental health is getting to be too much for them even playing with my cat who I love more than the world and who is helped me get through the bad times in the past is not doing me any good. There have been multiple times recently where the only reason I have not made an attempt is because I know there is no one who will take him and give him the love I do but there have also been times where I have legitimately considered finding a new home for him so I can finally end things.Every other time I have felt this way I have kept going knowing that Id get through that phase and be happy again at least more than I was in that moment but there is just something different this time. there is some kind of finality engrained into this awful mood I am in and I do not know how to deal with it. I do not think I am ready to die but more often than not recently it seems like the fastest way to get better. Recently Spiraling,Suicidal
15979,15999,Do any of you have any tips on how to distract myself? I am not tired enough to take a depression nap and none my friends seem to be available. All I can think of is killing myself. I thought of maybe eating a comfort meal. Things to distract myself to not commit suicide?,Suicidal

24846,24866,Death is easy. I do not know where I came up with this philosophy but I did. It mainly stems from the belief that at any point in life one can escape to any point in human existence. Life has only ever been a reassurance that this is fact. The only thing one cannot overcome is timeage and this is limited. I am highly suicidal. But any time I truly contemplate it I consider my options. I would much rather run away and dig wells for people struggling to live without clean water than to eat a bullet. I could go kamikaze on the homeless population and solve one of society's problems from within. fucked up but falls within human experience. I could be selfish and quit on family and throw my life into helping any one of hundreds of suffering communities. Fuck I could set out to end the war on drugs by becoming the biggest drug supplier in the world and then destroying the organization from within. If you are contemplating suicide consider how to best spend your life it could take 20 or 80 years to accomplish what you want but make sure yours is a life well spent. In all of human experience there is ALL human experience.,Suicidal
19012,19032,I do not like to wake up in the morning because it means I am still alive. So sometimes I take more medication it makes me sleep more so do not have to think about how much I want to die. Sometimes I take more of my medication than I should,Suicidal

10421,10441,I am 15 16 in well I guess a week now August 1st but I do not want to make it that long. I have a pretty good life but I am so depressed and hate myself so much and I am sitting here on the couch sobbing with some mild medicine that I know with enough of I can overdose on and just looking for a reason to stay I guess I do not know what I am waiting for I really put myself out there to help other people but I want to be selfish for once and act on my feelings even if it hurts them because it will help me I want to die,Suicidal
17198,17218,My twoyearold seems to have a severe language delay I am in an accelerated nursing program that I hate I have very few to no true friends I lose my temper with my kids all the time lately I am terrible at interacting with people and I think about suicide constantly. All I want to do is sleep. I keep breaking down into tears several times a day. I feel like I am getting weaker and weaker. I left voicemails for a few therapists tonight so I am hoping they will call me back and be able to help. But I am losing hope. I just fucking hate myself and wish I was never born I just want to die,Suicidal

14819,14839,Even just an attempt to show that I am willing to go to the edge. Otherwise I am just a pussy incapable of killing themselves who seeks help because they are weak. Is it logical? No not really. But I also want to show that my self hatred is real not a joke or something casual. I do not know. I guess I am so surrounded by mentally ill people who HAVE attempted that I feel the need to join them in order to feel validated. Besides I HAVE wanted to die for years now with passive suicidal thoughts and intrusive thoughts being extremely common in my day to day life. But now I realize that its an actual option and I cannot finish the job.Its a weird cognitive dissonance. People who seek help before attempting are strong but I never will be. And honestly I crave hurting myself so often now that its started to affect my relationships because all I want to do is destroy everything around me. I cannot seek therapy or help until I commit suicide.,Suicidal

23285,23305,First off yes my username is funny but let us get down to what I am really here for. My main problem is I cannot stop thinking about hurting people. Not just killing people but torturing and defilement of the living and dead. At this point I genuinely want this though in my mind I know its wrong the struggle is emotionally I do not care at all. Really not sure what I want out of saying all this some advice possibly? Empathy? Maybe just comfort in at least a possibility of being able to talk about this sort of thing without being branded as a horrible person which I already believe myself. I am scared of talking to people about my suicidal thoughts anxiety ect but I am definitely scared to talk about this. Also I am already taking meds and going to therapy if anyone was about to recommend either. Lmk if you have any questions. I should probably use a throwaway account or make a longer post but fuck it.,Suicidal
8595,8615,it is been years I have been dealing with anxiety depression Ocd and what not but everytime I have some big fight with my parents i feel its the breaking point and I am surely going to attempt to kill myself again. They have issue with everything I do how I behave how I look. I try my best but in their eyes I am nothing but a disappointment and failure which should not have existed in the first place. Yes they have said it to my face especially my mom. She is dealing with her own health issues because of which she tends to breakdown as well but there is a limit to talking shit about your kid. I never mentioned any of my relationships to my mother but she was very open about it so I mentioned about the girl I like now and she straight up demotivated me to the ground by saying I am not good enough for her I am unattractive and what not and honestly at this point if someone hands me a cyanide pill I would happily take it and end it once for all. I already hate myself and her talking shit to me just makes it worse more and more because I loved her the most in the entire world. Just because I am not capable of showing or expressing it does not mean I take her for granted. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up or OD on some sleeping pills and painkillers I hate myself and everyone around me,Suicidal
25512,25532,I just want this life to be over. Why cannot you accept that? Why do you keep me here in pain and suffering? To keep you happy while I wither in sadness? I will keep you inside. Where I lead you cannot follow. Straight into the light. As my breath grows still and shallow.,Suicidal

8289,8309,Okay I do not even know how to express my feelings but I will try. I have been lied to in my life by being told if I would work hard and get a good job I would be happy.This cannot be further from the truth. I am deeply upset. Something about me I am short and an ugly man nope do not even try to tell me otherwise I once posted on one of those am I ugly subs and I got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1.Okay so my problem is still that I get made fun of and I am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. But I want to talk about more to be honest.Men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that I could do about it because I am immediately met with What are you going to do?. Hell society even took my right away for being angry because if I would be called Napoleon if I will joke back then I would be called arrogant and if I will listen to insults or jokes as people call it I would be called a loser. it is a loseloselose situation.I am surprised that men just laugh when I mention my height they are like Oh I just cannot take you seriously and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if I have worked less than them my entire life and as if I do not deserve it. I cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. So I quietly take insults till I can and after that threshold which is just over I will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. Oh and please I am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. On the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying NoBoDy oWeS yOu AnYtHiNg well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. If somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? What would you do? Well I would go and help that person not because I owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. If you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as Oh gee I do not owe you anythingNow this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that I have ever seen I get told everytime some version of you are cool and have an awesome personality but I would date you insert physical characteristics but it is okay do not worry you will find someone. Well I have not found anyone and not only that I even asked them after getting rejected If you do not mind me asking what do you think I should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us? And you can pretty much guess what I get told.Although I am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when I approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else I mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. Pro tip If you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.And not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views turns out I am becoming what I hate I hate people who show no emotion I hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. But now I do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because I know when I would need help nobody would be there for me.Not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts I can link the study of you folks want.You know what I am frustrated at the fact that I cannot let my angry out I am angry at the fact that I cannot be upset because then I would be insecure.I am tired of pretending I am not upset I am tired of pretending that I laugh your jokes. I do not. I am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending I am too cool to get hurt.. I am tired of pretending that I am comfortable in my body because I am not. I did not chose to be this way. I do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. I am tired of pretending that I do not get crushes after 23 consecutive NosI wish somehow I could show the world and tell them that I am a human too. I feel bad. Everytime you make fun of me I feel stripped of my humanity. And I am especially especially tired of people telling me just be yourself or put some effort in and I have been told by those people that I put effort in on putting effort. And those people who say it are always good looking.I am sick hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. Is it so bad that I want to feel loved and wanted. Shit my own parents made fun of me.I am tired of pretending I am comfortable I am not. I have no zeal none at all to live. Tired of being belittled constantly.,Suicidal

24741,24761,I have been on the SuicideWatch and Depression subreddits for a bit and I have come to the conclusion that I do not want to die. But I also do. I do not want to die because what if tomorrow is better and I have just been overreacting? What if tomorrow gives me a reason to live? But in my 17 years of living no tomorrow has been good enough to make me want to stick around for another. I want to die because I feel as if my life is uselesswe will all die one day I just wish my day were sooner! My social life is definitely the backbone of my life but when I become depressed like this I constantly think about disappearing and self sabotaging and I am seriously considering it right now. I do not want to be depressed but I want to make myself as depressed as possible. I do not want to die but I want to make myself want to kill myself as much as possible. Prolonging the inevitable I do not want to die,Suicidal

15329,15349,I am really not sure if what I did was my fault?Previously I had a suicide attempt and on that night I was talking to him about why I wanted to and that I would miss him. I talked about my friends not trusting me and he thought I was referring to a secret that he said he had but refused to tell me. He then says 'do you want me to tell you so I say yes seeing as he made it sound like he had a permanent mental illness and was endangered. He then tells me the secret and it is something quite different and now he is saying that I forced him to do it and he regrets it even tho he says he is happy to tell me which makes no sense. ampx200BI have not spoken to him in days and he is my only friend and he is being so selfish he just misinterpreted my words which made him tell me and none of this is my fault from my perspective? I am just really not sure and want it all to end. My friend acts like I leverage my suicide attempt to manipulate him.,Suicidal

25689,25709,it is unbearable I feel so weak and my head hurts so much. My head feels like it is slowly decaying.it is been too many years wasted sleeping and doing nothing. I feel trapped it is like I have no other option. How do people get out of this? I have given up I do not have the will to try getting better anymore. I have accepted my faith.I tried to reach out nobody cares they just ignore it or vanish. People will tell you to stay for others but why? They do not really seem to care to help would not they want to help if they cared? When a dog is ill you put it down you do not let it suffer for your own satisfaction.I feel like there is nothing for me here nothing I enjoy and no reason to live other than my pup. I want to say goodbye The pain is too much,Suicidal
15876,15896,I cannot bring myself to do anything it is almost a year and I have stopped giving exams completely. I have one coming up but instead of studying I am here wasting my time I just cannot do it. The idea of having to speak in front of someone for so long it is just crippling even if it is in front of a screen. So studyng seems pointless because I already know I will probably chicken out anyways. I do not know if I will ever be able to graduate or even if I will be able to work apparently any kind of responsibility is way too much for me to handle. I already told my parents that I want to just quit they keep saying what is the alternative or at least try. I think they are sick and tired of me I mean who would blame them. My girlfriend will probably leave me when she realizes how much of a failure and a mess I am. I tried to go to therapy but did not quite work I just felt like I could not thrust her one bit. Sleeping is becoming harder and harder I do not want to sleep and wake up the next day so I just try to delay the inevitable by not sleeping. I know it is dumb I cannot help it. Suicide seems everyday closer. I cannot function like a normal human being I am basically a parasite. I serve no purpose other than wasting resources. I do not know if that is because I am mentally incapable or if I am just lazy and trying to find excuses but if the latter is true I deserve death even more. I do not know what is stopping me probably the fear of failure and the idea of making the few people that love me unconditionally suffer throught the pain of loss but at the same time I really do think they would be better off without me in the long term INSERT CLICKBAIT TITLE,Suicidal

22316,22336,I sit here hating every part of me. Wishing when I attempted this shit 12 years ago I would have succeeded. Here I am 12 years have past and all my thoughts during some of my worst times have resurfaced. I am not worth being here especially because I hurt my best friend and the only person who cared for me. I cannot do a damn thing to change it or even make it better. I have been through enough breakups but none like this. I cannot stand the thought of how much I hurt this person. I already hated myself way before this but she has slowly tried to work through those insecurities. They were never fully gone thought. If I lose her then it will also be the first time I would go living without the kids but she right to say they should not be split up. All this is the worst timing because we are suppose to move to the next town over in a month. But if she leaves she will stay here so the kids do not have to transfer. But I am getting off topic. The thought of not being able to have her in my life and not have that one person to turn to sucks. This girl would have been better off if I died 12 years ago so she would have never had the chance to meet me. She gave me the best 8 years of my life and I would rather die with these memories instead of going right back down that dark path I know I am heading for. I wish I could just pull the trigger! I am such a fuck up. I just want to be done with it all.,Suicidal
23226,23246,does anyone else wonder who would show up to their funeral? its morbid but i want to see who would be the fake mourners versus the people who realistically cared about me. i wish almost every day that i could get a birds eye view to my funeral if i could guarantee that i would get that then i would most certainly kill myself. i just want to see who actually cares an attempt to kill myself left me empty and broken from all of the people who had left me for the back of the herd. none of them wanted to deal with my recovery. but i still wonder how many of them would absolutely revel in giving my eulogy. its going to be like that,Suicidal

20798,20818,So basic information I have tried to suicide 3 times 4 years ago since then i worked on a plan to do it right and everything is done even the exact date.Now you see nobody knows about this because i am very good at not showing emotions and i try to look and be as strong as there can one be phisically and mentally and unstopable force and an immovable object and this works as I have no regard for my safety and so i make my family proud my friends have fun and I am a very loving and protective boyfriend single at the moment aside from this i study to become a neurosurgeon.I know very well this is not even close to what others are going through but in around half a year my suicide should take place as I am no longer able to keep up maybe i can last a couple of weeks more.I have to ask if there is any way to keep going aside form alcoohol because i already drink daily and aside from love and care because that is impossible any suggestion is good i am open minded. Long story short,Suicidal
13559,13579,Was going to post this on an alt but I cannot be fucked to change basically I am done everything and everyone sucks I have been in this downward spiral for the last 6 years and its hard to think rationally. I have dropped out form uni twice in 2 different countries cuz i could not stand how normal peoples brain works I have been diagnosed with a shit tone of stuff dyslexia Asperger GAD bipolar and recently psychosis. I have been force fed medication every since i turned 17 and now they got me taking Lyrica and Risperdal i feel like all this medication has caused my brain to not develop properly as i started taking the max dosage of Zoloft and Xanax when i was 17. Nothing feels normal anymore its hard to hold on to a thought for more than a few seconds I am going to give it another shot started going to a new psychologist and doing CBT I have done it once before i guess i did not want it enough back then tho just incase all goes south again i stole my dads shotgun just so i know there is an easy way out when i need it. ty for reading hope all is well with you Title,Suicidal
13313,13333,I often think about how different my life would be if I happened to be born in a more attractive body. How can the way people treat you be based on something which entirely comes down to luck? I feel so alone in the world I try and enjoy life but deep inside of me there is a sense of selfloathing that consumes me daily. I fantasise about how it must feel to truly be beautiful and to truly enjoy existing as yourself. In the end this just damages me more.I just want to be loved truly loved. Not just used when I am convenient and discarded when I no longer have purpose. I have convinced myself I am some hideous trolllike woman l disguising myself in a facade of beauty. When I do not wear makeup I feel like an ogre and when I do I feel like a circus clown. I hate feeling this way. In summer this feeling becomes so much harder to ignore. You suddenly become surrounded on social media with size 4 girls in bikinis and you feel more inadequate than you already do. I have analysed every inch of my body in such close detail that I can pinpoint every flaw. I hate summer because these flaws become harder to disguise I want to enjoy life in the same way a pretty girl can but I cannot. Because this self loathing is destroying me. It stops me from wanting to exist I want this shame to stop. I know in two weeks from now Ill feel optimistic about life but soon after that the spiral of selfloathing will return. It always does like clockwork. Its hard to be ugly in a society that places so much value on looks.,Suicidal

8888,8908,I have never been depressed really I have always lived my life carefree without much thought. But for the past year I have gotten thoughts of suicide. Mainly because my life is so fucking bland and boring. The most exiting thing that happens in my life is playing video games my life is really dumb tbh. If I was not a minor I would have already killed myself because I want to shoot myself rather then hanging or any other method The quickest way. Plus I do not have any thing to hang myself with. So I most likely will not kill myself until I can get a gun Probably 18. Has anyone else felt like there life does not mean munch like this? When I think about my future I know I will just work some crappy job because I cannot go to college. Thinking about what my future holds is what really makes me want to kill myself. This compared to the other stories on here might sound dumb but idk if I had a gun I would already be dead tbh. there is more then this but it is pretty boring and I'mm kind of lazy so eh I just do not know anymore,Suicidal
37425,37422,buying a gun tomorrow since stores are closed i ll spare you the details of my life since no one will give a shit anywayi amjust done with everything nothing helps yes i am well aware that i m not alone it doesnt make a shit of difference nothing can be done and i m sick of wasting life time money air as much as i love the people in my life they arent worth living with this shit nor are they of any help because they dont know what to do i tried knives but i cant bring myself to draw blood ,Suicidal

7334,7354,So I posted to a group where me and my friends chat about how if I was gone for a long period without talking 2 weeks since I am quite active there that I was probably dead. The reason being my parents want us to move to the country side with no internet beacause they are conspiracy theorists and such and the internet is basically my only support. And I honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if I pleaded on my knees and I honestly do not think I would want to live anymore at that pointI have anger issues and when I get quite angry I have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and I am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline. So they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move I would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself I could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point I do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so I do not see a reason to stay at that point So back to my friends I told them straight up if I am gone for 2 weeks no talking that I probably killed myself. I wanted them to know this since I did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since I know if i was in they are position that I would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and I left for bed I came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close and the other 2 had not posted so I assume they were offline The one that responded did not know how to react and when I checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and I do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move I do not want to make them upset Y'know but at the same time I do not know what to say I cannot promise that I will not kill myself it is the truth I would buy do not like seeing the upset but I do not want them to live on thinking I am okay I am honestly confused I am only 13 and I honestly cannot think of what to say to them. Any ideas? I need some advice,Suicidal

12728,12748,I am sick of attempting to please people's expectations. I am over the cycle of society. All the emotions that we can feel are simply a scientific reaction so who cares about love? I do not want children either but if I do not have them then people will judge me. I believe in God... I think? I do not know anymore. Everything seems to be a distraction from the truth of reality. Once we erase money entertainment buildings all humanmade creations then we will have nothing. But did we ever have anything? It was always nothing but comfort for our minds.I am sick of ableism racism sexism etc. Why cannot we just forget what happened in the past and think about the future of humankind? we are always behaving like God judging others as if our opinions matter. Judging each other's appearances intelligence and social behaviours. But what is the point of it? People judge others so they feel better about themselves.Life is pointless to me. We graduate from school to find a job use their deserved money to purchase gifts for themselves but the items will never be truly theirs. One day everyone who is reading this post will die. Then someone will take their items whether they are from their family or another. Some will sell their treasures while others will keep them for themselves. But none will love the items as much as you do. Your items will soon be recycled or forgotten. Dreams are much better. That is because society does not exist within our dreams. would not it be better if we dreamt forever once we die? I wish for that to happen to me. I will never get sick of them. I want to dream forever,Suicidal

11350,11370,I have never made a post on reddit but I feel like now is an okay time to tryAs per the title I am 21 years old male and I am starting to go bald. I do not want to make this post too long or anything but this really is the last thing I need right now and all of my suicidal thoughts are coming back and I do not know what to do. Growing up I had almost no self esteem I am barely 5'5 in a family of tall people and up until last year I was overweight. I have struggled with depression since I was 14 as well and I let myself go all through high school. I am gay and still not out of the closet so I had no reason to want to even try to look nice up until last year.I decided that I was sick of being lonely so I started to work on myself I got in shape I bought clothes for the first time in three years or so and I started to do my hair for once. It was all going great and I started to feel pretty good about myself. Up until three or four months ago when my hair started to fall out in droves. I went from having a thick nice head of hair to now being at the point that you can pretty much see my scalp no matter how I do my hair. I am devastated. Just when I started to care about myself and try to get out and meet people and maybe even start trying to date this has to happen. I have gone to my doctor and got blood work and all that and the verdict is it is genetic and just coming on strong. I do not have money for implants and even if some ointment or whatever works my hair is already so far gone I am afraid it will not ever be the same. I do not want to do this anymore. Every time I start to feel happy or at peace with myself something happens and tears me down to nothing. All I can think about is killing myself now again. The medicine does not work at all. I have tried a cocktail of anti depressants and this always happens. There is no happy pill life is always going to suck no matter what my attitude towards it is. It feels like someone is watching me in some Truman show scenario and fucking with aspects of my life to drive me to suicide. I am so alone and losing my hair is the nail in the coffin. I work construction do not interact with anyone but my boss one coworker and my family and I am unattractive. I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. My teens and 20s were supposed to be the happiest of my life and I have only spent them miserable. I do not want to live another 5060 years like this.The good moments just have not been worth dealing with all the misery to get to them. I cannot love myself no matter how hard I try I do not want to hurt myself but I am breaking down so badly right now. I have been banging my stupid head on the walls in my room so hard I have a headache still I cannot stop thinking about how ugly I am. I keep randomly bursting into tears in my room alone and then calming down and then sobbing again 10 minutes later. This is high school all over again and I do not want this. there is so much else on my mind right now besides the hair but the hair is what is finally pushing me over the edge. I am trying my best to appear normal for my family and not depressed but inside I am a complete wreck and it is only getting worse and worse and worse and worse and I cannot take this anymore Going bald at 21 is the final straw,Suicidal
7752,7772,Hi everyoneRecently I have been feeling really bad again. I am trying to keep going but its so hard. I have this strange feeling I just feel really low and anxious all the time. I feel awful and I cannot stop thinking about all sorts of bad things that upset me or scare me. I do not know what I am supposed to do. Id probably drink but I have run out of alcohol and I do not want to leave home to get more. I do not know what to say to people about it without just worrying them. I just need to do something to say something. I need to make this stop but I do not know what to do. Not doing good,Suicidal

20821,20841,I live out in the country there is a forest fire really close to my place. About an hour ago I called 911 to tell them about it. They said that they were aware of the situation told me what to do if I needed to evacuate and then told me to listen to the news for updates.Next thing I did is I called the suicide hotline because I have already been seriously thinking I need to kill myself over the last few days because of a million shitty things in my life that are all catching up right now and if I have to evacuate my home and let it burn to the ground then I am probably going to kill myself tonight or tomorrow.I started to talk to the operator on the line and tell her this. She interrupts me and tells me that this line is being recorded and that if its a prank call she will report me to the police and that its a felony. I tell her its not and try to keep taking to her. She says that I should call 911 that I should listen to the news for updates and then says that she has a record that I have called there before once before this year four times in the last year and then she hung up.This is the last time I am ever going to call a hotline. I have already felt bad every time I have called because I know there are other people who need it more then me but this is proof to me that my problems are not worth there time and I have been wasting their resources which makes me feel like killing myself worse. I am really fucking hurt that she thought I was prank calling. I have just started therapy a week ago but it has not helped me yet and I am still ready to kill myself because its not like one session can magically make someone not suicidal especially when the therapist I saw spent our whole first session making me fill out paperwork instead of helping me right away. These guys say that they will be there for you when you cannot reach or do not have access to therapy and counseling which I have not every time I have called. Lies through teeth.I am sorry that I am angry. I know that these lines have helped a lot of people and that these are volunteers trying to help and that this is a good service and because. I guess I am just hurt and bitter that I do not count to it anymore as stupid as that sounds. I am sorry.I know that most of the shit they say is fake empathy but the last times I called I let myself pretend that they actually could care and help because it kept me from shooting myself. The illusion is broken now I know its fucking stupid and petty to be so angry and hurt about something I deep down knew was fake but here I am. Finishing typing this post and I am seriously wondering how the fuck I am going to make it through the week or maybe even the night without finally doing it or if I should even try to. Idk. Sorry for the pity party as people have called it when I try to talk about or ask for help with this shit. Happy Monday I might make it my last. The suicide hotline thought I was a prank caller,Suicidal

15854,15874,I do not know if people will read this whole. I get it is no one's responsibility to read this but if you do read even little of it I humbly thank you.here is a summary of my situation I am done with the abusive relationship with my parents I have had for 18 year. They are trying to just completely destroy everything I care about. I have tried my best to fight them and I have managed to soemwhat defend myself things have gone extreme lately and I cannot continue to see so much suffering everyday. I have no one to ask for help. No one to talk to. People I trusted have turned their backs to me. I am already ill enough to have my peace ruined. OCD has been killing me for past several years. And I have no way to recieve treatment or counseling. Everything is gloomythere is a ton more that is bothering me but this should suffice. The major factor is lockdown in this. Spending most of the year stuck with monsters has caused this.On several occasions before I have been in this situation. I have even written my last messages but the second I decide I am ending this misery something stops me. I have these intense emotions and sentiments that show up. My entire life appears before me. My beliefs my interests and the memories I find priceless show up at once. And I think is that it? All this just for it to end like a tragedy?What about my precious thoughts and beliefs and emotions that are unique to me? And my philosophy of life? they will cease to exist once I stop breathing. I cannot let that happen. But then I think that existence itself has no benefits over non existence and thus everything is meaningless. Nothing has value until we give it. Plus if I die I will not even know I lost something.But the sentimental feelings are so overwhelming I finally decide to continue fighting this nightmare. And this is pure torture man. I have so much reason to die yet so much to lose and very little courage. I am only choosing to see more of hell every time I change my mind. I so want to end myself but I just cannot do it.,Suicidal

19438,19458,I am just over being alive. I was born with a messed up colon and needed emergency surgery right after birth and several more until I was 5. One day I may become fecally incontinent or need an ostomy. Why did not the docs let me die as a baby? I was brought into this world deformed and should have been thrown out with the placenta. As I got older and was not in the hospital I was sexually abused by older kid on the bus and mother's brother. I was beaten up daily by my brother. Bullied throughout elementary middle high school. Found out as an adult that I meet qualifications for level 1 ASD. Why am I still alive? Why can I not take to much medication? Why cannot I just escape this? There is no hope with the life long self hate and brokenness for me to ever not desire death. Why cannot I just get tboned on my way to work tomorrow? Done with meds. Done with therapist. Done with talking mental health with primary care doctor. Just dreaming of death until it finally grasps me. Why an I still alive?,Suicidal

7727,7747,My dream is to live on a farm. Maybe not a whole farm but I want a cute little cottage big enough for two cats a dog or two some chickens and a garden. To live in a small town preferably where family values are still alive. Id love to have someone to love and cherish and wed have a kid or two one day. My husband would be really nice to me and not make fun of me or compare me to other girls and make me feel like a failure for being born. I want to be known as that cute polite mysterious farm girl instead of a depressed anxious orphan. To finally have someone I can tell my story to and they would hug me and comfort me and tell me its going to be okay instead of just saying that is rough. Id love to have a small job on the side and spend the rest at home taking care of the household. I do not hold much value to myself anymore I only continue to live for other peoples sake anyway. that is my dream. Maybe one day Ill get to it. I am not so hopeful though.

21649,21669,I have never really been happy always hated myself and I do not see what fruity words anyone has I have no friends and I am not so naive as to think that the world is the problem their ate terrible people in this world and even they find people. there is just something wrong with me. I was doing better when I got a boyfriend he was not always the best bug at least I had someone who loved me. I said awful things to him and accused him of so much shit then told him I needed a break. I was terrified of being alone again I knew I would not handle it. I thought about everything I said to him everything I accused him of I realised I have been telling myself and i projected all that insecurity onto him and made him think hes a monster. I do this with all my relationships this one was just really bad I adore him so much. I tried to apologize for what I said but not that he shot me down he just did not respond. I think hes just had enough. The only person I had left and I treated him like shit. I feel despicable. I do not want to be those people who end it all because of a guy and I am not I just placed my last hope on this one person and it is all gone and I have done this to myself. I am alone the world is screaming to me it hates me and I do not blame it. I cannot treat people this way and I cannot be be on my own I cannot handle my thoughts anymore. One of the biggest reasons I never entertained the thought was because I thought it was a sure fire way to get into hell but after a little research I discovered it is a sin but it is not unforgivable. So I have planned it a quick cut into my carotid artery and I will be gone within a minute. I just need to dedicate a little more time into getting productive or whatever so I can at least say I tried to get better. I cannot imagine feeling better,Suicidal
20176,20196,I truly thought I had beaten my depression but then god said fuck you and I am right back where I started. I just cannot do this anymore. every time I get up I just get knocked back down. plus ADHD is not making things any easier. I can see myself deteriorating and I cannot do anything to stop it. I have just resigned myself to a life of depression. since I keep getting knocked down what is the point of getting up I am back,Suicidal
25827,25847,I had everything ready to go and my note was already sitting on the table of the hotel room I was in. I was stuck on a vacation with my family who does not care about my well being and would care less if anything bad happened to me. I got into a huge argument with my mom at universal studios because her boyfriend kept talking about gun violence and how he would shoot me dead if he could because I am trans. She took his side over mine because it was a joke. I left the park early and she yelled at me for being a waste of time energy and money. Honestly I agree with her. I self harmed a little bit once I got back to release the pressure from the argument and then I prepared to take my life in the hotel. I would have done it any other day but there is something so cathartic about self harming that I had a major migraine and I was exhausted. So I took everything down and ripped up my note and took a nap. I am not sure if that is a sign but maybe when I get back home Ill do it since that is a more appropriate setting. I was too tired to kill myself today.,Suicidal
12922,12942,What are they going to do to help me? I am not some guy standing on the ledge of a building waiting for them to bring the trampoline and the megaphone out.

20203,20223,To clarify I am not in imminent danger of killing myself I do not want my mother to bury me which has been my sole deterrent. But I wasam in the midst of another bad episode and I just started writing last night. This is going to sound bizarre but it was almost cathartic explaining why I feel the way I do. I have picked up my phone and put it down so many times over the last few days years but there is no one around me that I feel I can ask for help so here I am. Sorry I am not at my most articulate. I wrote a suicide note.,Suicidal

15705,15725,all i want is for someone to care about my day for once. to listen to whatever nonsence i have to talk about. so i tried for so long to give others that same kindness. listen to their stories about their day pain jokes whatever and i do my best to make a conversation about whatever they want to talk about. always themselves. but nobody ever gives me the same in return. now I am depleted. i have nothing left to give. no kindness to give. so now how can i possibly ever expect the same from others when i cannot give anymore? I am left a sad empty hateful hypocrite. nobody cares about my day my life my pain. they just want to talk about every fucking detail of their life to me so i can give them validation. i cannot do it anymore. and now by saying that i feel like I have sealed my fate to just be alone. grow up to be the crankey old man that nobody likes.i want to fucking kill myself i cannot give others what i need,Suicidal

27040,27060,I am neither someone who suffers from depression nor someone who lives a fullfiling life. If i have to discribe myself i would say i am just a statue of Indifference.I have for a long time contemplated argued debated this question. Why? Why am i not ending my life even though i do not see any point in living on?. Its not like there is any thing material or nonmaterial stopping me. so why?. Is it because suicide takes too much effort? Is it because lack of resources to end my life?. Is it the right opportunity? is it just basic survival instinct stopping me? I think not these are all just mundane reasons i can easily overcome.I have possed this question again and again i have come to answers again and again i have retorted those answers again and again i have rejected those answers and possed the question again and again.so what? I cannot seem to come to an answer that sparks the flame to burn all my doubts an answer that can satiate my gap of curiosity.I feel uncomfortable. My indiffrent nature is being voilated its annoying honestly. I just need to know so i can quickly end this unreasonable life. Why am i not ending my life?.what is actually stopping me?.,Suicidal

7425,7445,As the title says I have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope. it is started when I was around 16.517 24 now and basically my life had stopped ever since. I need to mention I am using the common medications for hair loss and though I have had nice results for some time my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.I am so lonley have no social life since I am ashamed to go outside have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman and it is all because of this malicious curse. I would trade absolutely everything I have to have a normal head of hair like a guy my age should have. I would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. I know the hair is not my only problem but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.I was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as I am still trying to fight for my life hopeful to make an appointment and although the guy there said it is still too early for me does not mean It looks anywhere near decent he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when I had last visited the clinic and I looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what I have now. In fact I was once a pretty handsome guy though never appreciated it but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old sad and ugly to a point of no return.In that point of time it really does not matter whether I actually end my life or not because I feel like I am already dead. Actually I do not even feel like I am human anymore just a pathetic useless piece of rubbish. Having better days is actually the worst thing because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse. My youth has been taken away from me and I feel doomed to be lonley and hating my appearance for the rest of my life.I have no idea what is the point of this post but anyway thank you for reading and have a nice rest of the week. Going bald is slowly killing me,Suicidal
21864,21884,Being a boy is so much easier I fucking hate being a girl. You grow more fat you have periods higher sex assault percentage and it just sucks in general. Society expects girls to shave be pretty and skinny. I just fucking hate it. I fucking hate being a girl,Suicidal

26713,26733,I never thought I would be this weak. I knew I was weak even when people would still acknowledge that I know how I could have been strong by keeping up but I am having a hard time lately. I am sure this place has a lot going through so much.. I think sometimes someone making the time feels better. I waited all day for someone I like and she disregarded me.. For 12 hours I waited. I was disregarded and canceled on last minute and it hurts to realize I am so alone and the people who care probably feel pity. I do not want to burden you all anymore. If I were to go to another place would anyone pray for me..? I wish I was not so sad.. Why does this all hurt so bad. I want it to go away. Please go away. This pains too much. I need a sign God. I need faith. I am losing it all and I feel so weak. I am fine. I just had to vent. Bai,Suicidal
12853,12873,I should have killed my self years ago I am crazy in debt to the point where my credit is shit so even with a job Id be homeless. I cost my parents so much money daily just so I can eat and live so I am total fucking burden. I feel everyone around me is disgusted by my appearance and I feel awful about it. I mostly try to watch tv and play video games to escape so I am not me for a moment I should have done it years go,Suicidal

22492,22512,I have felt panic about being old and aging since I was 17. I feel like I am constantly suffering a midlife crisis and now I am 32 single female but now I have got bags under my eyes gaining weight from psych meds. No Family shit career as an artist totally broke.I still want to have fun and be carefree and have sex and party but my body just cannot keep up anymore. I do not even know what else I enjoy.

9679,9699,I do not want to do my thesis. it is not worth it. My mum is bitching at me because she does not believe i have depression and my dad is the same. Istg if it is not because of their money i would run away. I fucking hate them. Dad used to abuse me physically when i was younger. Both of them abuse me verbally and mum would give away info about me without my consent. Mum wanted me to be a doctor so she groomed me into one. I still like medicine but this is sucking my life out. She has her wet dream into reality i suppose. They gave me expensive gifts but never understand my feelings and mental health. I wish they are dead. I want to sleep. I do not want to face this shit. I simply want to sleep and tend to anything that i like forever. I want to be a floating thing instead of being human. This shit sucks. tired of this shit,Suicidal
8559,8579,In may this year i had a psychotic breakdown i had suicide attempts and nearly got sectioned literally the worst day of my life. My dad goes in between being supportive and saying how I am making everything up and idk why i just do not get over it. Now its literally got to the point where hes sick and bored of me being mentally ill. Like because I am not having suicide attempts and in psychosis anymore i should be fucking running a marathon every day and doing a bizillion jobs like i cannot handle barely getting up in the morning. I have started having a lot more suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harming in the past weeks its got to the point where i think I am going to relapse i do not think I am going to kms yet but i will if it carries on. Also i always get blamed for money problems it makes me feel like a burden and want to jump off a bridge. I want to tell him that complainings making me more suicidal but i dunno like what to do i might get my therapist to mention it. Also recently my family has fell out with me because they found out my mum abused me and they denied it happened like honey ty i just want to die i wish i died in may. My family are making me want to stab myself,Suicidal
16632,16652,Stop just fucking stop brain It hurts so bad,Suicidal
17662,17682,My thought process into getting a feathered friend was that I would care and love for such a small thing by doing so I would receive that love back. It made it worse somehow?? What the fuck I wanted him so bad I could not think of anything else. Now I have him and I feel trapped and I feel lonley and I have no body but my family who does not and will not understand how I feel ever. I thought a parrot would somehow fill this void? What the fuck? Something is wrong with me lol very wrong and I feel the need to help anyone and everyone! Everyone but my damn self. I cried today do not do that often because I took my bird Emmet away from the one thing she new and that was family. What the fuck is wrong with me. I hate myself and will never like myself. I feel stuck all the time sad for no reason and I am a sensitive little bitch. Fuck. Me. And fuck this banter that makes zero sense. Why does the thought of having to get my act together make actual friends and deal with the world make me want to DIE. FUCKING BULLSHIT. Hi I just got a cockatiel thought it would help me?,Suicidal
24828,24848,I do not even know why I am writing this. I just think that I cannot talk about this things without alarming o worry the people in my life. I do not want to feel like this anymore everyday from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed I feel like absolute shitSometimes when I am out with friends I feel a little relieved and when I am with my boyfriend my mood is generally better but firstly we are in a long distance relationship so we cannot see each other every day and secondly I cannot count entirely on somebody else to be happy. I have suicidal thoughts everyday multiple times a day but I struggle to talk about this because even if I am almost sure that I will never act on it because I have hope that someday I will be if not okay al least better I cannot convince others of that. I feel like I am slowing becoming more and more difficult to be with I am terrified of that. They always say a good friendboyfriend does not leave you just because you are struggling but it happened to me before how can I ignore that? I do not want to be a burden. All I want is to be happy or at least stable and to be a source of happiness to others. Sometimes I feel the need to ignore everyone to not drag them in the depression pit with me because there are days when I really cannot control myself and suppress what I am feeling and i KNOW that it affects others. I feel so hopeless what can I do to make things better? I feel exhausted,Suicidal

23020,23040,I hurt one of my friends 2 days ago. What I did was fucked up and they blocked me. Then called me a suicide baiter and in it I lost 3 friends total. I tried to convince myself to die today but I am so pathetic I cannot. Being that they blocked me I am sure they would be ok if I died seeing how an apology does not matter to them anymore. It might give them satisfaction. that is fine. Should I kill myself for being a suicide baiter,Suicidal
25715,25735,I am 15 and ever since I started puberty everything went downhill for me. I realized all the harsh things about reality that I wish I never knew. Especially being online all the time surrounded by so much negativity and hatefulness. It probably does not sound like a big deal but its too much for me to handle especially when I feel alienated from everyone and like I am a terrible person. I struggle with so many unwanted thoughts and feelings that I feel like the only way Id find peace is when I am dead. I am constantly surrounded by so much misery its too hard to take in and process. I do not know if this is just teen angst but its a horrible feeling. I wish everything was nicer and easier that I do not have to deal with difficult feelings. I feel like I am the only one struggling with the conflicting thoughts I have. I tried finding people who feel the same way but I could not making me feel even more alienated. I am afraid that one day Ill break and actually kill myself. I do not want to live but at the same time I do. I do not have anyone close to me that I can express my feelings to and if I just keep my feelings to myself I am going to continue drowning deeper and deeper into my misery. I am starting to feel like I do not deserve to live,Suicidal
19073,19093,When I started having suicidal thoughts I assumed assumed they would end at some point. I assumed that a new job losing weight having more sex throwing myself into religion would heal me. But each day the thoughts are stronger.I do not know if I will kill myself but I am tired of feeling like this. Being depressed every day. Only having short bursts of energy.Everything I touch fails every one I come close to ends up hating me. I hate myself on a consistent basis. I am always trying to change myself. And now I just want to end it all.The worst part is that I cannot speak to anyone about it... No one understands no one can help. And most people feel a sense of enjoyment from hearing how much better their life is than mine. It really is a prison and there seems to be no way out.Is there anyone who has escaped? Like really escaped? It never ends.,Suicidal
9672,9692,Basically telling people about my depression has only made me more depressed because they accuse me of things. I realize the more I tell people the more isolated I become in my feelings. No one can fix me at this point. I have to rely on meds and therapy for the rest of my life which are not even adequate. I am just suffering every day until I build up the courage to shoot myself in the brain. My dad threatened to send me to the hospital because I kept screaming to relieve myself from PTSD. I do not want to study or go to school anymore. Everything is meaningless to me anyway. I feel as if I am on a stranded island by myself,Suicidal
15657,15677,Ok so I never really used this place to rant. I had an horrible childhood that led me to become overly shy in public. Yes a man who can be socially insecure. I can already hear everyone running away. It seems like the worst thing for most people for some reason. It comes with lot of problems but I will cut right to the chase I have so much trouble finding a woman that you would not even believe me if I told you the stories... I had so many opportunities of women coming to me seducing me doing the first steps and I messed most of them. The 2 times I tried doing the first steps it worked well but I chocked out and could not handle the pressure. Also I would give you examples but I doubt this place is NSFW even though people just openly discuss about death. I had something happened to me yesterday... pure torture seriously. it is like the devil or bad luck is playing with my soul. Anyways. I wish there was a way to find love easily for overly shy people. Whenever a cute girl comes to talk to me I just freeze and it is like I cannot find anything to think or say. They either think I am rude or not interested.. well that is what I presume at least. Sometimes I even ignored some of them even though I really wanted them. what is wrong with me? I tried seeing some doctors and shrinks about my shyness issues but it did not work. Now I live by myself and it sucks seeing everyone around me every single person is in couple or dating someone. And it seems so easy for them. I could try some dating app but I am too depressed to even try. Plus I feel they are lame. I do not know what to say. I am just in a real mess. It pisses me off you know? I do not know maybe I should stop caring. Maybe I should stop giving a shit and start drinking. I feel like I am trapped and I have been thinking about ending it recently. My life is simply not worth it. I am never drinking but tonight I might get drunk. being overly shy really sucks,Suicidal
23432,23452,I have attempted several times myself. Each of my siblings has attempted. My eldest brother completed just before his 40th birthday 13 years ago. I am now 40. I first attempted when I was 14. I was fed up with my self loathing at a very early age. I took a number of painkillers and only succeeded in making myself violently ill from every orifice. After seeing what I had done. My mother told me to get up and go to school. I did not attempt again until my wife left me a little over a year ago. This time I tried to gang myself with a belt in my workshop but some friends had recognized my despondent language and called the police who interrupted me mid attempt. I was taken to a psychiatric facility for the first time. I proceeded to undergo loads of one on one abd group therapy. But I spent my evenings consuming lots of drugs and alcohol and entering various entanglements with several women over the next year. Nothing truly serious until I met someone who shared a first name with my wife. It took me several months to approach her but we fell fast once I did. It was a quick and tumultuous relationship that ended with me not wanting To subject another to my anxiety paranoia and abandonment issues. I broke it off but not before a week of incredibly self destructive behavior culminating in some sever self harm that she ended up sharing with lots of mutual friends on Facebook. Plenty of people came to my defense but I still believed my life was over as my mental illness was on public display now. My suicidal thoughts became overwhelming but I had the wherewithal to check myself into a hospital before doing something drastic. Fast forward a month later and a after a tap on my shoulder at a bar I turn around to the most gorgeous smile I have ever seen. Uncharacteristically i made it known I had to know this woman. I ignored everything Id been telling myself about not getting involved seriously again and we fell even harder and faster then I have ever had before. But I have done it again. I have sabotaged yet another wonderful thing with words intended to destroy utterly. I cannot keep doing this but i dread being alone at the same time. I do not want to hurt myself at this particular moment. But I know its only a matter of time and or booze before it takes ahold again. Please help. Tired of subjecting others to myself,Suicidal
14926,14946,I fucking hate being alone. I just want to die.,Suicidal
13827,13847,Let me begin by saying I am NOT an antivaxxer antimasker or covid denier. I am simply too tired of this pandemic that is all. I hate online class feels like I do not learn anything and going to college while balancing a full time job sucks so much. I am tired all the time and I cannot even go out to clear my head.I feel like I will have to redo the first two years of college to be able to learn properly because online class sucks so much. I miss going to parks and museums going to the cinema and just being out and about without having to worry about masks hand sanitizer etc. I wan't to experience life again but now I cannot even eat an icecream cone outside because I might catch the virus. Sometimes I think that covid deniers are happier that the rest of us because they still live their life as if nothing is happening. Sometimes I wish I was as ignorant as they are so I could still be somewhat happy. The two reasons I do not ditch safety protocols is because I do not live alone and because it would make my feel really bad for putting others at risk but GODDAMN it would be nice to experience normal life once again. I will not be getting the vaccine anytime soon not because I do not want to but because there are not enough vaccines in my country we are having a shortage since the beggining of the vaccination here. Thx Brazil for being a complete dumpsterfire. Anyway I feel like I will not live to see the end of this pandemic because I just want to fucking die alredy. I hate waking up everyday just to experience the same day over and over and over again. Things will not improve here and I am ready to just fucking end it because I am so exausted. I have had depression for a total of 7 years now and I feel like my time has come because life is not worth living anymore if I cannot even enjoy small pleasures such as drinking a soda while outside. There is no meaning left for me and the only thing keeping me alive is the fear of what comes after death. I am exausted,Suicidal
21526,21546,Title pretty much explains it all. I am going to have to repeat 1 or 2 more years of high school and the thought of that makes me want to slit my own fucking throat. Because of this pandemic and my lazy ass my grades have gone completely down the toilet. I also do not have a job or a drivers license which is pretty fucking pathetic. And before you say it gets better in college! I am too fucking poor to get into any type of decent college. And even i was able to id probably just end up flunking out or killing myself anyways so it does not really matter. I have already fucked up my life at 17 and honestly i deserve it. I let it get this bad and its all just going to go downhill from here. I am a fuck up,Suicidal

19609,19629,I am diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder and things were really looking up after being diagnosed a year and a half ago. Recently I have become aware of just how deeply it affects my life on a daytoday basis and I guess I am struggling accepting that part of myself. It does not help that I have had this premonition I get premonitions a lot and I know how it sounds but they are actually very spot on of the year 23 since 2016. I always felt it as an end an end to what I could see anyhow so I was not sure what it really meant. I turned 23 in August last year and it is been a pretty tense year I have been scared of big trucks bc that is how I am going to go but I knew I would know when the time came... well... yesterday it did... a week from now I just feel it. And all the things that have stopped me before when I have been suicidal are either solved or do not bother me anymore. So I am just trying to figure out what to do in the meantime? I have considered going to the ER and ask for help but I do not know what to tell them.. that I know I am going to die in a week? it sounds stupid...But I really feel no need to live any longer I am happy with the life I have lived and I feel like it is just the end of the road for me.do not know if anyone here can relate at all or have any advice but I really just wanted to tell someone. I do not really want to die but have foretold my own death for years and it is one week off,Suicidal
21429,21449,I am covered in blood I am freaking out,Suicidal
24137,24157,If I die it will because too much pain to those around me so I just could not do that although I think about it everyday I just do not see the point in this shit anymore.I have a great life I have supportive parents that I have good relationships with I have wealth and do not have to worry about money I am almost upto date with all my school work but this is not me bragging I just feel ungrateful because I want to throw it all away. I just wish I never existed and never entered everyone is life or that someone could take over my life that would appreciate it more than me. I do not have any reason to be sad yet here I am sad everyday living my life pretending I am ok so nobody around me has to worry about me. I do not think I am pushed to suicide yet as I think 1 of me likes to believe things will get better but it is been like this for 6 years and I do not know if I can do another 6 of it at that point it is like what is the point in living if nothing gets better.

Before going to sleep I afraid to wake up in the morning When I sleep I dream of strange monsters eating me or people I love and who love me from my family strangling and stabbing me and trying to kill me I do not know why I have a good relationship with my family.I suffer from sleep paralysis a lot this year compared to previous years There is not a single moment in the whole day that I feel safe or comfortable.In the past I used to feel happy sometimes but now I cannot feel joy or happiness only pain and suffering I tried to live a lot but life is not for everyone.My life was already bad before Corona and now my life is worse and more difficult when Corona ends I know that my life will not return to the way it was before Corona.I could have lived maybe a few more years but something bad happened to me last year I was not hurt by anyone just an absurd coincidence.Every thing is painful I do not like the world I do not enjoy living suicide is hard but living is impossible I wish I was never born.I think suicide is an inevitable fate for me I will commit suicide on July 30th I wanted to commit suicide on my birthday last week I turned 22 last week but I could not because my little sister will finish high school exams on July 29th I do not want to ruin her education.My life has been full of physical psychological and sexual abuse and during my school years I was subjected to severe and continuous bullying The biggest reason for being bullied was my strange personality.I remember the last time I was happy and safe when I was 7 years old I wanted to kill my self since I was 8 years old I wish I could just stop existing because I am in a constant state of suffering.I do not believe in hell but I am very afraid to go there I forgive everyone who has hurt me and I hope everyone I have hurt will forgive me because I have hurt some people and I regret it so deeply that sometimes I cannot breathe.I hope my parents siblings and all my family will forgive me I tried to commit suicide before but in a way that makes my death accidental So that my family would not feel severe sadness because of my suicide but unfortunately I was saved.I hope everyone I know from Reddit would forgive me for not replying to their messages during the last 3 months.Sorry for my long post and sorry for any spelling or grammatical mistakes English is not my first language.If I survive I will write an update but I hope I do not because I do not want to keep suffering. I am trapped in a horror movie,Suicidal

22943,22963,Well not really an ugly treatment but it is just too discomforting. Even strangers sometimes make comments about me as I pass by. not too rarely the treatment I get from people especially girls that have about the same age as mine really differs.And as many as 0 girls actually one in middle school but I was too much of an incel and a crybaby to do anything about it have ever taken an interest in me.while I do not want to be the one who says waaaaa ma friends get da pussy while I do not but yeah as I said it is really discomforting. quite a lot get interested in my friends. looks are not everything you can overcome this problem with confidence! probably true but my confidence level is at the same height as the burj khalifa upside down and the treatment I have gotten during my life certainly has not helped in this.I am also really short probably even shorter than 5'7. And that has an even bigger impact on general treatment and opinion from people.I excel at nothing. just slightly better grades than average.I... do not know what to do.p.s. I am 16 so my chances of growing even a little bit more just to be average height are basically none. ugly people get ugly treatment.,Suicidal

7018,7038,I feel like nothing everyday I wake up and ask why am I alive and why did not I die in my sleep? I mean almost nothing to most members but of society so if I offd myself people would forget about me after using my name for publicity after 3 days.When you die people only care then use your name for clout.Tired of living a life I did not ask for I have no goals no motivation. I live in a bum ass town encompassed in a shitty county with no opportunities. People tell me no excuses but I do not care I am not as strong as everybody. And being a man they expect you to suck it up and hold it in. But in reality I just rather off myself or die in my sleep. On the edge and probably about to write my final note.,Suicidal
7428,7448,Hi I do not know why I am writing this here or anywhere at all but I feel like a mess and do not know what to do and pheraps someone here can help me.I cannot say I have ever struggled in life I had everything I needed to this day my parents always suported me even when I probablt disnt deserve it I have a social life and friends even tho I am not very social I feel like I have every thing One would need to live right. However I do not feel good about myself have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself purpose value right and wrong it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless talking to people seemed meaningless to me i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts lonelyness zero purpose crying nights what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night. With time and her icentive i went to college as well my parents had to getMoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like I was getting out of my hole fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel. But it was not like that today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to live and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case i suicide has been on my mind lately as well i just do not know what to do I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward i feel miserable a failiure and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going oportunities will arise but please take them make it worth it do not be like me.

19654,19674,I have been reading the note my uncle gave me over and over almost compulsively. I keep thinking and wondering Why do I still feel so miserable even after going to therapy? I asked for help and help I received. Most of my friends know it takes a long time for me to trust people. My mother left me came back left came back and basically destroyed my view of a family. I lost my therapist recently I feel so abandoned... So I got to thinking I have been trying for 3 years to get better and stop attempting suicide. Everyone knows the saying 'How many psychologists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one but the lightbulb has to want to change.' I think I am preventing myself from getting better. I feel like nothing has changed. I still go to sleep praying I never wake up. I still cry myself to sleep trying to manage my spiraling emotions. But at least I stopped cutting myself every night. Or seeing how many pills I can fit into my mouth like its a fucking challenge. I am trying!I am stuck in a rut and I am running back and fourth. I want to fucking die. I want to die!I wish I had the guts to try it again knowing I am probably going to live. I want to die...People do not trust me. People do not love me. People do not care. I was so fucking sad and felt so abandoned I tried to kill myself. Who cared? My mom dad and uncle. that is it. Maybe if I died I would be better off. Thanks for reading. Why do I keep trying...?,Suicidal
15731,15751,I gave myself a year to try to be happy. But I am not. My therapist sucks and always ask the same three questions. My medication stop me from feeling anything which at first was great because anger and sadness were gone. But then I was just completely empty. I felt nothing. So I changed it to something stronger. But it' s exactly the same.Sometimes I feel great. Like oh great today I do not want to die ! And the rest of the times I just wish things were done. Quiet silence. No pain no regrets just the wonderful emptiness that is death. And in those days I have no one to call.No one is here to give me a hug to say I love you and to listen to me cry. I have parents a sister and friends but no one to call to say I need help. Please hold me. Please anyone... In those days I just want to know what keeps me from dying. I just want to be happy for once without guilt or shame. Is that too much to ask ? And why am I still alive ? I have no one to call,Suicidal

I do not want any sympathy or words of reassurance I just do not want to suffer when I go.

21052,21072,i cannot do it. I am sorry. everyone says it gets better but its not. I am trying so hard but nothing is improving. i do not know what to do. i cannot tell a therapist or my mom because they will send me to a mental hospital for the 6th time. i wish nobody liked me so i could kill myself without upsetting people. but I am lucky to have a good mostly family anyway i know others have it so much worse and I am ungrateful. but i only have my family and 1 online friend so everyone will probably get over my death soon enough if i do it. I am probably going to write a note and try to find a way to do it without anyone noticing. it sucks when you do not have a vehicle to go anywhere and do it alone. ..,Suicidal

23335,23355,I have always had intrusive thoughts about killing myself. It seems inevitable. Everything in my life appears to be going perfect I had been able to manage the intrusive thoughts so that less than 5 were thoughts of self harm. But today more than 90 of my thoughts have been self destructive. Many times today I thought about swerving into a semi in the oncoming lane. Hopefully I can keep it together long enough to leave the country and find some hope. Thank you all for existing. having a difficult time,Suicidal
10136,10156,Before I used to be thinking about suicide from mid 2020 from mid 2021 so for about a year it was horrible days returning home just sit behind my door having a mental breakdown crying myself to sleep thinking about suicide. Over the past few months I have gotten better I have strayed away from people who hurt me tried to abide my parents all the time to prevent being yelled at I still have mental breakdowns and think of suicide once in a while but I do not really think of it as an option nowadays I fear one day I will just get worse and worse and never heal. I hope that never happens. But to whomever reading this things can change. For the better. To whomever is reading this I love you you are precious you are beautiful you deserve the world.

26405,26425,Nobody cares. Everyone just ignores it when I am obviously giving signs that I need help. I am sitting alone while all my class mates talk to each other and to the teacher but not even he cares about it.

Funny how they all do not care,Suicidal
13531,13551,To those who have attempted before when you were dying what did it feel like? Was it peaceful? Or was it painful? Did you regret it and realized you wanted to live in your last moments? Or did you have no regrets and not fight it? To those who have attempted was it peaceful?,Suicidal

8020,8040,I will be using letters instead of names.my friend N is the reason I am alive today we have been friends for a long time and hes the closest friend i have ever had. i introduced him to my online friend T a month or two ago and they have been inseparable ever since. i cannot text either of them because they say that they cannot talk because they are talking to the other. so I am all by myself now. i tried to kill myself a little while ago but it did not work. i thought well even if it did not work maybe something will change.nothing has changed. in fact things have only gotten worse. I am being completely ignored. i lost two valuable friends. T because i was an idiot and introduced him to N and N because I am not enough. N was the only thing keeping me alive and now that I have been replaced i do not have anymore value. but what if i try and fail again? what then? all I will have accomplished is making everyone around me feel like shit. i do not know what to do anymore i feel so stuck. i wish i was never even born so many people could have lived a better life if i was not born. I am just an expendable sack of flesh and bones why should anyone care about me. i cannot believe i ever thought i was important to N. it was stupid of me really. I have never been important to anyone so why did i think he was different? even so he is the most amazing person I have ever met and i will never forget him. i hope he knows thatidk what else to say i think I am done. anyone got something to say that might be helpful? i did not realize i could be so easily replaced,Suicidal

13142,13162,I am 40 years old. All my life I have had the ones I love taken from me and it just keeps happening.I shut myself down for years after losing my daughters all because I refused to take my ex back after she cheated on me with some guy from her work while I was raising our kids.I recently met an amazing woman a truly kind and gentle soul. Against my better Judgement I let them in. I struggled to trust anyone after what my ex did I had to well I felt like I had to keep everyone at arms length to protect myself. but I trusted this one I let my guard down.Now someone who is in her life that has tormented and betrayed her and left her isolated has demanded she isolate herself. She did so without question.I have had people suddenly disappear on me before and not cared. After losing my daughters anything less than something that bad has not hurt at all. Why is this time hurting so much.Its my fault. All of this is. I must be an absolute monster to keep deserving this pain and isolation. I am so very sick of being broken and alone.I am so very sick of... All of this. I am so sick and tired of having the people I care about being taken from me.,Suicidal

15451,15471,This might be downvoted to hell but I truly do not care anymore. I also struggle with mental health but probably suffers to a lesser extent.He has expressed multiple times he does not want to get help despite me repeatedly asking him to. He always says selfdeprecating shit like how worthless he is and how he has no friends which hurts my feelings because am I not a friend? I do my best to be there for him but it. Is. EXHAUSTING.I met up with old classmates I have not seen in awhile and I felt like a weight was lifted over my head. I did not have to worry about if I was triggering anyone with what I said. I did not have to listen to them hate on themselves. I realized a lot of times conversations with my depressed friend sucked the fucking soul out of me.Yesterday I did not respond to his online messages because I wanted to keep this happy feeling a little longer. Today I woke up to him saying he wanted to kll himself and lamenting how hard it is to get the things necessary. I want to scream at him for being so fucking inconsiderate about how this might trigger me. All the nice feeling I was riding on just plummeted. Now I am stuck worrying about him and if hell make it till tomorrow. I wish I can tell him to find another person to lay his problems to. I wish I can tell him the things he says bums me out to say the least. I wish I can tell him being around him makes me feel worse. But what kind of friend would I be?These things will probably hurt his feelings and maybe drive him over the edge which I would never ever want to do. But I am just so sick of it. So sick and tired. I am sick of my depressed and suicidal friend,Suicidal
14254,14274,I do not know why this is so hard to understand i feel like people in my family take my breakdown at the end of my college study to be out of nowherethat subsequently made me quit it altogether. you are not depressed yada yada. I have a lot of unresolved anger bouts as a teenager I broke down crying when I graduate high school. Yet it is suddenly so surprising. I am tired of living and the expectation to suddenly becoming a competent adult. I am 23 this year constantly being suggested to apply to college just for the sake of ithaving a degree my older sibling already move out and have their own kid I could not talk to my dad as talking to either of my parents feels it is going nowhere.I do not feel understood yet I do not think they want the version of the me that is an utter failure and have little to no interest in studyingworking in STEM fields. I do not know I hate being here I feel sfuck. I cannot talk to anyone irl because I feel they will just judge me even online is hard. I want to die. a mentally unstable kid will not suddenly be a mentally stable adult,Suicidal

26502,26522,Was making close to 50kyr. Stalker from a video game began defaming me online. Said I abused children drove him to suicide and made false accusations resulting in his arrest. All of which are demonstrably untrue and the guy has done this to other people w mixed results. Sometimes landing himself in prison for stalking.I had a lot of support from others but hearts on your tweets do not pay the bills. I lost everything that mattered.Legal action is convoluted due to it being a cross border thing. I would basically have to bankrupt myself just to get a restraining order let alone sue for defamation. If I do not he will continue to email future employers with defamatory claims and I will bounce from minimum wage job to minimum wage job indefinitely. I begged people in my life to take this seriously at the first sign of trouble and they never did.Police are aware of what is going on but almost comically advise me to blow all my money on lawyers.there is no woman in the picture. I have done nothing but sleep and watch Youtube for the past three months. Completely lost interest in all my hobbies. Most days I wish I never woke up and I wish I could speed up the process. Stalker destroyed my life,Suicidal

14020,14040,Hey everyoneFirst time poster here. I am 30 years old and I have been fired or laid off from 3 jobs. I just got laid off from my current job today after working there 4 years. My landlord also recently told me she wants to airbnb the place I live and I will have to move. I have had a few relationships but nothing serious in the last year and a half. I do not have a drinking or drug problem I just do not think I am able to function anymore.When I was 20 years old I remember hearing Larry King sincerely say things always have a way of getting better and I really took that to heart. After watching how things have progressed over the last 10 years things have not gotten better. It does not seem worth it anymore.Also I am not currently suicidal but have been there before. I am not really sure what I am going to do next but thanks to anyone who reads this. Laid off and kicked out of my house,Suicidal
22212,22232,A month ago I tried killing myself twice because of my wife's infidelity. we have been together 20 years married 17 we have a 14yearold son. She went ahead and got on Ashley Madison and hooked up with a stranger three fucking times at a local hotel which is just devastating me. The mental anguish is unbearable. I have started Lamictal and that has been great and I have never felt better but the infidelity is still on my mind which in turn just makes me want to end my life. Having feelings of suicide again...,Suicidal
10697,10717,Life is ok some days but darker days lose every ounce of light I struggled to gather Good days are ok bad days sucks the meaning out of them,Suicidal
18313,18333,so i did not pass for application to my dream college and course though there is still a chance of my admission being reconsidered..despite that everything feels like crashing down my mum did console me but it was mostly god has a plan for you etc I am not religious nor hold any similar beliefs or that it is not the end of the world although i feel that way especially with my lack of will or determination in doing most things for the future.my family is aware of a past attempt and i guess the way i reacted to my college results end up worrying them ill still try to recover and improve despite my thoughtstldr i failed my dream college admission but there is still hope but please do comment words of hope of comfort outside religion or fate themesthank you in advanced please send words of hope or comfort,Suicidal
21795,21815,my gf of 7 months decided to dump me and I just want to die. I have a lot of trust issues and am not good with people irl so all my friends are online its honestly a miracle how a pathetic loser like me got a girlfriend and I was happy for the first time in ages until today where she dumped me. I wish I was a better person I did not do anything wrong to her. I hope she is happier and finds someone else way better than me I think it would be better if I never existed at all break up,Suicidal
27259,27279,And move right along obviously I dwell and still think about all that had occurred but I fail to express my anger or frustration verbally or physically. I feel like I should be more mad about stuff than I am but I am just not I want to literally punch a whole in a wall but I do not have the energy to do so. I am tired. Physically mentally and emotionally. I' am not sure how much more I can withstand. I do not even hurt the same no more.. I just be like damn that happened,Suicidal
16048,16068,Look at that poor homeless lonely man sleeping in the streets he really do has real reasons to be mad and unhappy with life. Unlike you Jared who has had a great childhood and a pair of great parents who have cared about you and are still supporting you so you can be someone in life and a good contribution to society.Someone told me this last day. I do not know you all but for me at least the fact I am not in a situation as bad as the one other people is having does not give less significance to my reasons of why I would like to kill myself. Just because I have not come to a worse scenario from the one I already am does not mean anything to me talking from my suicidal point of view. I am tired of being said Why would you someone who have had a great life and can be a successful person chooses to run from it and kill yourself?,Suicidal
23257,23277,a bit of a long post ahead so skip if not interested. have a nice day though.its been about 5 minutes since i drank water1 month since my last attemptthought2 months since i made this reddit account and4 months since the incidents I am going to be real and say life is a load of crap. it really is just a load of shi. if my younger self from 2 years ago can see what I am doing. the person never saw it coming. i had a decent life. good grades good family a good set of friends normal and happy but we all know that life is not just going to make us stay normal and happy. 4 months ago something happened that changed everything you can read this reddit post which sums it all up i guess fast forwarding to now i lost my people a bit of myself but its ok. as i said life does not get better. I have been trying to work on myself the past months. realized that it was so hard to start a conversation and trust another human being. it was so hard to establish a connection or a relationship when you had first hand experience of many years long lasting ones that just suddenly cut you off after one mistake. to be honest i am still trying to forgive myself for what happened. what am i saying? I am saying thank you to reddit. thank you for suicidewatch for being an avenue i can release and people can comment. life really does not get better but you really do move and eventually heal.life is meant to give you crap the way you handle it is the key to true happiness. i will come back with updates on my feelings in a couple of months. for now i hope you whoever is reading this is safe. life does not get better you get better,Suicidal
12533,12553,Sometimes I feel guilty or embarrassed when I read other posts on here from people who have had some truly awful experiences the reasons I have for wanting to die seem so petty in comparison. Nothing bad really happened to me I am just worn down,Suicidal
37352,37349,sis don't. my life isnt how you think it is. my life is a miserable.,Suicidal
15463,15483,I do not want to be exist or have consciousness. Everyday I think about not existing anymore or never existing in the first place.Why cannot I opt out? And even when I tried I failed. Am I just the butt of some of a twisted joke? I am so tired. What did I even do to deserve consciousness and existence?,Suicidal
20404,20424,Friends steal from me and blame me for not trying to contact them. I try to get help but I cannot find any doctors near me. Its like the world wants to reject me. My whole life I have never felt accepted by my peers. Men are abusive and I stay away from the because they will only find a way to blame me for being a victim. Things just keep getting worse. I just want to go before it gets any worse. I cannot see how things will get better.,Suicidal
23577,23597,I am turning 18 next spring. I have been suicidal since I was 12 so understandably I have never had any realistic plans in life. I can do art and I can write but that is it. You do not support yourself with that where I live. I always thought that I would just kill myself before I would get anywhere. I genuinely thought that I would not see my 14th birthday and eventually turning 17 was a miracle. Now that I am 17 it hit me that I do not have any plans or dreams beyond oh I should wrote a book and then a watertight fully doable realistic suicide plan I have worked on and improved for years. I do not know what to do with my life when I never even planned on living this long. But hey if it all goes to shit at least I still have that plan up my sleeve. I will probably do it before it even goes to shit just so I do not have to die in dirty clothes. I am just realising that I am getting closer to adulthood and I still do not know what to do,Suicidal
13819,13839,Every time I think about how much of a pathetic loser I am or how fucked up the world is I tell myself that it does not matter because I will just blow my head off with my shotgun one of these days. I know it is a bad coping mechanism but it is really the only source of comfort I have. The thought of killing myself is the only thing that comforts me these days.,Suicidal
19757,19777,I do not really know why people coming in here i do not really seek for attention or anything but almost 95 of the posts are left dead no comments or reply without anymore people that here for help or listening it is me or this subreedit is most likely dead like all of us that coming in here it could be ironic that a subreedit that talking about dead and suicide were left empty. Anyways it always been like that you called for help but nobody came What the point of coming in here,Suicidal
16157,16177,I do not have anyone to say goodbye to in person. So goodbye. Goodbye...,Suicidal
27269,27289,Life back when I was younger was so great. No worries once so ever. I am growing up and I am terrified to.Life amp responsibilites keep getting added into my life. It only got better for me in a few moments and now I am back still miserable. I have tried to kill myself before and they were all too painful. I just want to sleep forever.I feel like such a disappointment to my parents. They love me and I still feel like shit inside. I cannot mantain friendships so what is the point? It gets harder as you get older. Everything does. I just do not want to live in such a depressing world. It likely will not be livable by the time I am older.Oh and I made this account because someone I know would bother me if they saw this post. I use to be so happy.,Suicidal
25069,25089,i do not need messages or any talking me out of it. i just want the easiest and fastest way to say goodbye to those i care and love for. this is my choice and it is better this way. best way to say goodbye,Suicidal
12188,12208,The therapists invalidate my feelings AND do NOT understand why people in extreme pain over long periods want to die. Nothing gets solved and I get humiliated. Fuck that. I have given up on therapy. Suicide it is for me.,Suicidal
15201,15221,So today was supposed to be my first day at work and my family was super happy about it because I am very depressed and hardly leave my house. I was in a shitty mood so I took some xanax and smoked some weedand went to work I know I am a worthless drug addict but I forgot my phone and the doors were locked since the dining area was not open until 1000. So I had to drive home to get my phone but by the time I got back it I was an hour late so I came home and explained to everyone why I am a massive failure who is so weak that he cannot even live.I have become what I was most scared of becoming a redditor that does drugs and plays video games all day. I cannot believe that my life ended up being like this. it is not really like I can get better either my parents try to support me but they just cannot deal with my issues which is understandable And my Friends just fucking dumped my ass to the curb after I started getting very depressed and taking hella pills I have a therapist but I can only see her like once a month.This pandemic just completely fucked my life. I was still depressed before the pandemic but not to this level things were getting better and then covid happened.I just do not like life people this world and society. I just cannot deal with all the horibble shit that happens in this world and to me .I can tell my parents are disappointed in me but I cannot blame them. I also told them that I do not believe in God anymore because this world is too fucked up to have a God running it and if God does exhist than he just fucking hates me and this world and is a vengeful peice of shit motherfucker that I would never worshipMy life is in shambles I am just going die nodding off idgaf anymore life is too shit to go on. I feel absolutaly sorry I took xanx and forgot how to spell that drained of my soul and being I just want my LIFE back I just want ME back and I just do not know what to do because the only support I have is the half ass meme advice my parents give me and my therapist who does not help much and can only see me once a monthI do not have any friends I have nobody I do not have a soul and no really gives a shit about me and I am completely alone in this world. Fuck everything. I never fail to disappoint everyone,Suicidal
24088,24108,I do not necessarily fear death but at the same I just cannot bring my self to actually kill my self beacuse I am affaid I would just mess it up and be forced to go to the psych ward. I do and do not want to kill my self at the same time.,Suicidal
21183,21203,What am I supposed to be fearing regards to death? The religion I was raised in says it will be a deep sleep. Science tell me it will not be anything. But for some reason I still cannot do it. Let me not say for some reason the truth is I know why. I am a pussy. Honestly I cannot take my life in to my own hands because I am a pussy. I do not want to try to live my life out of this religion because I am a pussy. I cannot tell anybody how I feel about the religion because I am a pussy. Instead of just shutting up and moving on I am here because I am a pussy. I know I am weak yet i still cannot penetrate my skin with my knife. Why? Because I am weak I cannot do it because I am weak. All I have to do is endure pain for a couple of minutes and I will not feel anything anymore yet I still cannot do it. I lost my god I lost the one person that always had my back. I lost jehovah. I have been with out him for 6 months trying to pretend I am not sad. Telling my self that I am ok. I know I am not but whining about it on a forum is not going to help yet here I am. I do not even have fucking friends all I have is people on a server. They do not even care for me they care for a username. I wish there was just a button to press to die. I with there was a bus or train to stand in front of. I wish I had a gun to go out in a painless way. But no I do not have any of that stuff. I have a box cutter and a pocket knife. I keep pressing it against my skin but I am not man enough to break. I am a pussy. I am not strong,Suicidal

9522,9542,I got a job and I thought it was fun but they overwork me. They do not train me because they are busy. I just want to kill myself. People could say stuff like well start your own company.... you do not get it. I want out now. In the beginning I thought well I should just work harder and I kept up with my work through self research because they do not have time. Well how did they thank me? By giving me more. I cannot handle it and when I say something about it they respond with well the works keep coming.... yeah it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash. I am a hard worker but now I just do not see the need. Tf is this life? I want out. Hate this rat race,Suicidal
27011,27031,I get days and days of feeling worse than useless ugly and disgusting during which all I can think of is killing myself. Then I will have a stretch of a few days where I feel ok do not think of suicide and I invalidate my own experiences of the previous few days it cannot be that bad I feel fine now I guess I do not need help I feel fine now if I was actually going to kill myself I would not be feeling like this now and then before I know it I am back to a place where the only thing stopping me is the lack of easily available suicide methods. Rinse and repeat. Intermittent suicidal thoughts?,Suicidal
11942,11962,a few months ago i typed in these wordsi want to die but I am too scaredi felt so selfish knowing that others actually have.was i overreacting??what was there left to live fori tried reaching out but my friend group left me. 4 times I have triednobody caredi'm in the same place i was when i startedbut I am going to persevere because there has to be some good left in this world.at least i hope so a few months ago.,Suicidal
15487,15507,you ever feel like you really really need to talk to someone but at the same time feel like you do not deserve to? or feel really embarrassed even thinking about it? its all in my fucking head confusion,Suicidal
16023,16043,Everybody is telling me that. And there is no way I can improve a single thing in my life.I am very sorry for having done all the atrocities having conceived children being the worst.At least I should let have them choose a better father figure. I am not the one. Never have been. Rather no father than bad father,Suicidal
26666,26686,i hate myself and want to die.ampx200Ba few days ago only i would have hung myself. i have written my suicide note and given away things that once i used to treasure. all of this is so pointless...but i cannot go away. bec i have someone really close who is solely dependent on me. i cannot leave him here and go away to a better place. i have had ideas of strangling him to death and poisoning him but it just seems impossible to do that. to kill the person i love so much that i would kill them. and there is my family too. i have no idea why they love me. perhaps my death would perturb them. ampx200Bthis fuckin sucks but maybe i deserve it bec i am so pathetic. i have to go away but how can i?,Suicidal
16441,16461,where can i buy a suicideexit bag in the UK. preferably in cash. i cannot make one at home i suck at diy and will mess it up just give me answers,Suicidal
35883,35878,dizzyhrvy that crap took me forever to put together. im going to go sleep for DAYS,Suicidal
7726,7746,I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop. I am just looking to get this off of my chest please disregard,Suicidal
17499,17519,Anything positive will do! I am very tempted to just give up. Ironically the trigger was posting on Reddit but I have nowhere else. I have all I need to die. I was planning on it but I managed to get myself out of it but again I have ended up back here. Probably my own fault though was not helped by how negative most spaces online are. I want to die because there is no point. I have wanted to die for years I have attempted plenty of times. I finally found a reason to live recently in that I am trans. That realisation gave me hope but that is long faded. Its years on waiting lists its the stress of fighting my corner all the time. Constant abuse online. No one in my life understands. I wake up and I see a man. An ugly pathetic man. It does not feel like me and I have to go through the day colleagues and strangers seeing me as a man. Dead naming me. All because nobody understands. The constant hate in the media on social media even at my university! Then I think is it even worth it? What if I do not pass what if being a women is not enough? what is the gain from continuing to live? The only reason I am reaching out is i made the mistake of convincing myself I could cope. I wish Id never done that wish Id given up long ago. I have written this in a rush at work sorry if it makes no sense. I am used to people ignoring me.I know I am not worth the time. I have been told I am selfish and attention seeking. So that is probably all this is. Need help! Plan to die tonight.,Suicidal
12472,12492,I dread waking up in the morning. The days are lifeless pointless all of it. Nighttime is when I only begin to feel a sense of happiness but that is mostly because Ill get to sleep again soon and escape. Sooner or later a decision to die or get back up and fight will have to be made. I feel as time goes on it leans more towards inevitable suicide I have isolated myself and have no desire to do anything during the day other than contemplate suicide. I have the means to do it but not sure if I actually can. I have practiced the motions and all of it. Just a matter of pulling the trigger at some point.,Suicidal
19518,19538,Hey all! English is not my native language so please bare with my poor English skills. As the title says I have an internet friend and he shows hard suicidal thoughts and he also was talking that he will do it until or on Sunday. I am so worried and I honestly do not know what to do. I am so scared that I will lose him. He means a lot to me even though we only know us through the internet. Has anyone ideas what I could do to help him? Help! Internet friend is getting more and more suicidal the last few weeks,Suicidal
22298,22318,this version is the correct one. I do not want to wait in suffering anymore and my suffering is permanent. You can gool yourselves with the bullshit you can not know what the future brings yet only experince I had was misery and loneliness and a fucked up brain. One day you will not find a person that wants to live. The world stinks and we are going down with it drowning in our shit.Bye a permanent solution that everyone will eventually experience to a permanent problem,Suicidal
12465,12485,I have decided I am just going to drink this morning. And I do not know if it will end up in me attempting or if I will just wake up at 8 PM feeling like shit end spending another night alone stuck with my thoughts. I feel weirdly calm about the fact I could possibly end it all this morning. I guess the alcohol could be making me feel a bit less stressed about it? you do not know. Sorry. Getting drunk,Suicidal
13480,13500,This is just a long rant. I am really at my wits end at this point and no one can help me including myself it seems. I have been trying so hard yet I feel worse and worse about life. I hate it and most things in it. I try to like it but I just do not. I do not want this life. I often wish that someone who thinks life is great would have been put here instead or that Id die instead of these people who seem okay with life. I want out. Medication does not do shit yes I tried it for a long time therapy does not do shit and again I tried it for years getting out and doing things does not do shit exercise does not do shit I do not get those endorphins everyone talks about I just get worn out. I do it anyway to be hEaLtHy but I am honestly tired of all of that too. Meditation is nice for a minute but does nothing and I am honestly sick of the mental gymnastics of all mindfulness things anyway. I do not like checking my thoughts all of the time.I am chronically ill and will just keep declining as I get older I now have a chronic eye infection that is risking my vision. That alone makes me want to die. The doctors are condescending or think I am stupid or not trying when I am doing the best that I can. Its getting to be too hard to do it all.I was laid off of a job that I liked and could do when covid first hit and have not been able to get on my feet after that. I had a different job but I could not handle the boss who was a mean bitch to everyone including her own husband and left. Still have not found anything else even though everyone is hiring. Are they really? Because I go and apply and they still will not give me a chance even though I do not take drugs I have no criminal history I do not ask to be paid a ton and although I have not had the opportunity to finish college cannot fucking afford it without work its a loophole I had a high GPA. I cannot seem to pass these fucking computer tests that want to know your personality. I guess my qualities are shit in the working world. Repeatedly I have been told that I am too quiet. I talk when I see it necessary I do not just say things to fill the space even when I really try. I just am a failure. I do not like this mess of a world and how there is problems everywhere sometimes self inflicted problems that I wish people would wake up to. I cannot stand it. People tell me too look at the bright side or be happy that I am not in a worse situation but I do not like all of the bad in the world. That makes me sad.I feel like everything is so fake too and I cannot stand fake. I do not like how relationships work either. Biologically I crave them but they always leave me in so much pain. I feel like a lot of men do not want women anymore they would rather jerk off at home to an e thot and play video games. They only want women for an emotional or physical punching bag. I do not think I am bad looking and I keep my weight level. I try to be polite and have a listening ear but it does not matter. We cannot compare to porn or digital pleasures. Meanwhile I get unwanted attention from scary men 3x my age and I hardly feel safe.I do not have anything that I really enjoy like other people do. Everything leaves me disappointed like that is it? And if something is fun it never lasts long. Fun seems far and in between. I just want to die. I have nothing to live for. I am useless in the working world and very few people care about me. Most would not give a shit if I was gone. The older I get the more disappointed ill and sad I will be. I am really hanging by a thread because I cannot trick myself into liking life. No therapist can give me an activity that makes me like life. I am not even sure I can change that. Every day seems to give me another reason why I do not want to live,Suicidal
23028,23048,I do not even know what I should do anymore. I just want something to happen that would wipe me off this world. I thought getting my dream job would make me happy I was just naive. I achieved that goal and I feel absolutely nothing. I have no other goal now. My one thing that I had to go on means nothing to me now. How stupid and foolish of me to think it would solve my suicidal ideation. I cannot imagine my life without it honestly. I really cannot imagine what life would be like without looking at every object and situation and think of all the ways it could kill me its been my whole life and I wish I was joking. I just want a way to go away without hurting anyone but how ridiculous and egotistical of me to even think my absence would hurt anyone. I am so done...I have a lot that many wish for I am privileged and very lucky but yet I every moment I just want to kill myself. How ridiculous. At the end of it all,Suicidal
11024,11044,i cannot do life anymore everyone i know is doing amazing and so well my friends leave me out of everything fun and treat me like a child. my gf is only happy if I am giving everything i can give. nothing can keep me happy. i do not enjoy what i used to love. I am to afraid to runaway. and i think suicide so so so much and it seems to be an option that i should take. as i do not think many people i know would really care anyway i cannot,Suicidal
9045,9065,Dealing with so much pressure grief loss stress. Feels like I am delaying the inevitable and causing myself more pain. I am stuck in loseloselose. Every time i feel like this i try to give myself reasons they seem to all be in vain hopeless pipe dreams that i can never reach. Why do i allow this nonstop cycle to continue i cannot stop it i keep going on hating myself more for doing so. Who am i kidding,Suicidal
15246,15266,My baby brother was murdered brutally last year. I still cannot believe it happened it hits me like a tsunami. I loved him more than anyone I have ever loved. And I was his star his amazing big sister. But I have struggled with suicidal thoughts ever since I was 13. He on the other hand was so full of life and always had a smile on his face. My brother suffered from a serious illness but it never got his spirits down. All my life I wished I had the illness instead because he loved life and I did not. Every time I had a suicidal thought I would think how sad my baby brother would be I could not bear the thought of hurting him. Now I wish I was the one those men took that day. He should be here. I cannot imagine to live this life without him. I cannot believe this is my life now. My little brother was murdered I cannot stop thinking I should have died instead,Suicidal
8494,8514,So many people post here. you are lucky if you get more than one comment. A lot of the time people just upvote and do not even say anything and that is if your post is popular. Normal posts have the opposite problem. Maybe a few comments but no upvotes. Oh well. I do not know maybe this post is stupid. I am probably wrong I usually am. I just know that every time I come here because I want to be with people that get it I end up disappointed. And its ironic. Because this community is here so that we do not feel alone. But it honestly never helps me. Yet I come back. Either to leave a comment to reach out to someone I relate to or to a make a post that I delete immediately. All of which pretty much leads to more nothing. More loneliness. So yeah I just had to say that. And obviously none of you guys will even see this. But I hope that whoever does has an okay day. I am still trying to learn to celebrate the ok days myself. Because those are my new good days now. I do not have good days anymore but that is okay. I am trying to get by without doing anything to hurt myself or the people around me. If I manage to do that then my day was okay and that is good. Too bad when it rarely happens its still never enough. But at least its better than the bad days. Posting here to try to feel better is almost as futile as living.,Suicidal
7680,7700,I do not know where else to turn to. It feels like my brain hates me. I should be happy I have a good job I have a roof over my head and clothes on my back more than a lot of other people have. I should be able to smile but it drains more energy out of me than I can possibly describe. The voices in my head tell me I am not good enough I will never be good enough. Pathetic. Useless. Worthless. Stupid. waste of space time energy and matter. the world would be better without me besides what is a small screw in the grand scheme of things the world will still spin my family will move on. Maybe without me dragging them down they can finally be happy. I look in the mirror and I harbor nothing but disgust and resentment for that thing looking back at me. and then it speaks to me Pathetic. Useless. I learned at a young age people will pretend to care about you if they can see your scars so I cut my legs they cannot see those no one will ever see those. they pretend to care and then talk behind your back oh look cutting again how PATHETIC grow up be a man I have told my family about the monsters they say its just a phase 'its not a fucking phase I just want to feel ok ok motherfucker now you have got my attention I need to change a couple things' but what to change I eat right I exercise literally only drink water. My dog is the only thing in this world keeping me here. I made the decision to kill myself June 23rd 2020 at 521 am I tied a noose and hung it in my closet wrote a note that no one would ever care about and stepped into my closet for what I thought was the last time then my dog barked and she never does that. I cannot do that to her So I will live for her. but how Pathetic staying alive for a dog. an animal that would forget about me in a month. I have family that would forget about me in a month friends that do not even care now. I bring up my past to family my parent told me its impossible for a man to get raped well guess I am the impossible happened twice in my life once at 13 and again at 15 so I secluded myself away from women and now I have a hard time opening up to them when trying to get a relationship and they do not understand that not exactly something to bring up on a first date and heh never get second ones. How Pathetic typing to a bunch of strangers who do not care. why should they. I have tried getting help but the meds make me feel worse all of them the therapists push their agendas no one is against you they are only for themselves but if I am not for myself then no one is. Worthless. I have even done things that I thought id never do I have prayed and prayed looking asking for help for the strength to get rid of my demons my monsters to no avail. The monster just laughs at me Useless. I used to be smart used to have a lot of practical knowledge now its all superficial Stupid. Nothing I do in this life will make any difference the words I say will bring no impact to anyone else. all I want is for just one 1 person to read this I suppose. but that is a lot to ask. why would they waste their time their energy their precious internet activity on someone so Pathetic. I want to reach out but I am just a waste of space time energy and matter I do not matter. I never will when I die the history books will never say my name they will never look at me just bones in the ground turning to dust at least ill be useful to the fungus probably not even the right place to post this there are so many more people in more need than I am I made a promise and I intend to keep it I will not die until I give my dog the best life its what she deserves. does not mean I do not spend every waking moment wishing thinking planning my death one day just disappear never to be seen again. I would go to Canada in the northern forests find a spot in the summer I have already picked my day June 23rd. what a good day to die the method I am not so sure guns are messy pills are unreliable rope does the trick. If anyone has read this I thank you I am sorry you have decided to waste your time reading the words of something like me but I thank you nonetheless. I have had this typed out for 3 days just hovering over the post button not wanting to burden others with my stupid problems. if this gets sent at all id be surprised.

26179,26199,it is hard to explain but to me no matter what I do I cannot seem to really fit in this world. Like my body is not me and I cannot live while I am in it. I feel this giant disconnect between who I am and who I think I am that it is impossible to focus. I know dissociation is common amongst trans people but this just feels worse and HRT is not helping anymore. I am probably broken inside and I just want this pain to end. I cannot focus anymore,Suicidal
22465,22485,Each day that passes by I seem to find solace more and more in the thoughts of death. How relieving it must be to be relinquished of our suffering loneliness anxieties worries hardships failures. Ah it must feel like an era of constipation succumbing to a small opening. I want to feel this energy coursing through my veins dissipate into everywhere and bloom like branches of lilacs. I want to feel the end of everything. I have had enough of this mystery of life. For some it is a great joy to explore life but for me I am an actor being excited about the joy in life. As a child I remember feeling so different from everyone else and begging to know the answer to the reverberating question Why me?. But back then I was hopeful. Scratch that. I was nave. To think that I will know why? That the future will get any better? I wish to revert back to him and keep dreaming about happiness. I want to rid of these thoughts. My future stinks of failures it constantly shouts worries at me it exudes some disgusting repellant it cripples my mind with the thoughts of neverending loneliness. Death has fooled me for so long. Why is death hidden away in the pockets of the dead? Why is death so stigmatic? Why do we fear death so much that our fear sometimes leads to it? Each day that passes by the more I realize that death is our hero and savior in our transient lives. Death is our true God that hides. Death is nothingness and nothingness sounds more sweet than everything. Death is sounding more sweet as each day passes by,Suicidal
8695,8715,When I wake up there is this tiny moment where I realize what my life has became and who I became and I ask myself what have I done? How did it get this bad? Why me? I have tried so hard but nothing seems to work. I came to conclusion that I am just a hopeless case and this is my destiny. I do not want to be anything to be honest. Because I would not even know how to live a life that is bearable I really do not. Tomorrow is my birthday I am turning 19. I know that is young but I feel like I have lived here forever. I went through so much and experienced a lot I am an old soul and do not want to do this anymore Lost in life,Suicidal
13874,13894,I have always struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts. Life currently is alright. Have a decent job a good dog and birth family. I am almost in my 30s and I got divorced recently. I do not really have a lot of friends and have never really been great at connecting with people. Since my divorce I moved to be closer to family. My suicidal thoughts and depression are getting worse. I am afraid of being alone for the rest of my life. I want to meet someone but at the same time I kind of do not. I have always been an introvert. I honestly do not even know where to meet friends nevermind potential significant others. I am not great at Public posts but I want to know if anyone has honest advice. Depression and overall feeling of hopelessness.,Suicidal

15272,15292,Already picked a date. End of this summer break is going to be it for me. I cannot say I am glad to go but I cannot say I am sad to go either. Everything has been terrible lately. I have been struggling to find happiness and I feel like I am falling behind on everyone in my life. There just is not any point in going on. Nothing matters I do not matter. we are so small and insignificant compared to everything that is out there. It just does not matter if I do it. I am fine with everything fading to black. I am giving up.,Suicidal

19992,20012,I hate my life so much I am sure that i will never be happy with it. My number one goal in life would be to start a family but i would not want myself to be a husband or father due to my upbringing if i really loved my future wifekids Id let someone else be their husbandfather. I am going to kill myself so if reincarnation is a thing then i will have another chance soon if its just the end and nothing happens after death which i am fairly certain this is the case. At least then i will be at peace i feel like the whole heaven and hell thing is extremely unlikely. Suicide is rational in my mind,Suicidal

9819,9839,not dead neither alive. I live in a nightmare with no way out. I just cannot take it any more. I had a bright future 10 years ago that was wasted because of misophonia. I cannot work or study because neighbors are too busy making noises 247. And the few seconds while they are quiet I am wasted. I take 6 different medications everyday just to deal with the damage. it is like you having diabetes and people force feeding you sugar 247. there is no cure i cannot take any more headphones all day long because my head is tired. i have no more will to fight i kind of accept my destiny now. I almost had a heart attack yesterday and today because the fucking asshole upstairs kid was jumping the hell over my head despite them having two fucking floors the playground bellow. we have talked with them many times they know it. I do not hate them in fact we are friendly but i have a trauma related to kids jumping. It all started 10 years ago with this kid's cousin. Then another cousin was born. And now another. They do not live here but it is a fucking nightmare. I am a shadow of who i was. i do not feel alive. And i cannot sell now the apartment because justice in my shitty country only works for banditslong story too painful to even say it. I have no money to get out and feels like someday my heart will finally stop beating. i feel like a zombie,Suicidal

9906,9926,I am so exhausted...Tired and broken. I am not anything to anybody anymore and everything is my fault. I did it to myself because I have always hated myself for being less than. I am not a good person son brother etc...I just do not see a reason for living much longer. I try to distract myself with porn and video games and the internet in general but its not working. I want to die. I NEED to die... I am watching myself age and sink further into utter ruin. I do not have a reason to live... The only thing holding me back is time... I want to die outside in the cold. I figure the least I could do is not kill myself in my mothers attic and have the nosy neighbors witness my body being carried out. Tired.,Suicidal
8338,8358,i cannot do this anymore it never changes and i have no reason to keep goingi have the right pills that will actually kill me and my arm is already bleeding pretty bad it will finally end i do not think ill be alive tomorrow,Suicidal
13338,13358,I am 15 and I am suicidal.I was born in 2005 when my family was having fights. I grew up in my hometown till I am 5 and never probably remember seeing my father. I moved to a city from my village when I am 6 and then things just got complicated.I was the only kid and never had anyone to play with but then my sister was born. I thought I am lucky to have someone to play with after all. I suddenly lost all the attention from my only parent. I felt lonely and I preferred my school more than my home. I was doing good in my school but things changed when I hit puberty my understanding of this world changed. It was chaotic to be lonely all the time and that is when I had my first thoughts of suicide. I was getting bad grades my family has constant fights over everything in the past and I decided that this was the end. I was forced to join a boys scout it was really hard to for someone to be already in a controlled environment 247 and joining this made it worse I was criticised for everything I could not manage my school and this and pressure on me was at peaks. I had little to no friends nor any family member that I would rely on so I had confidence that my family would not even flinch a bit if I disappeared. Guess what I attempted 3 suicide attempts in a row and the third time I attempted my body could not handle it and I was a literal moving dead body for months and even while I was recovering I wished I would die and planned things I cannot even imagine. For the worst part out of nowhere a girl from my class proposed me I was in shock but eventually I fell in love and lived happily for a year. My perspective on life changed and I was grateful for her. But I was devastated on that day that she said that she would not want me anymore and she would be concentrated on her studies.I was mad AF. I threw up fights on her randomly she was my life my only fkin hope to ever live in this world and she was gone just like that. She got over with me in weeks while I still fkin hope she would come back after 2 years.I had extreme levels of depression and still do now I could not talk or express my emotions. I was trapped in my self. I lost all the interest to live. I was addicted to suicidal ideation. I used to play the songs over and over till that made me cry. I was desperate for the love I experienced once but then all of it did not last much. that is what anyone would say but to me it was my world. I had a hope to live but it could not even last till I could even experience it. I am destroyed my hopes are all lost. I do not want to live anymore. I am still alive for no absolute reason just satisfying people while I am alive and waiting for that day to have that courage to attempt it because my life is worthless and I am nothing but a loser. I want to die you would say my suffering would not last long but happiness is not forever either. My wasted life of 15 freaking years.,Suicidal
10103,10123,I do not know maybe I am just morbid. Although I say that in a forum filled with many a morbid people. But I would probably consider myself pretty recovered. Hard to say but a quick comparison to taking genuinely lethal overdoses every night to wondering whether I should put down Stardew valley and go to sleep at night is a pretty gigantic change. But its funny its still there. I bump my hip in to the side of the counter why do not you kill yourself you stupid bitch. Not every time. But a fair amount. I guess I just do not really get to talk about the weird change because the people I am around have not experienced it in the same way I have. But yeah. Its just a strange existence. Sorry. Anyone here ever just come back to remember what was?,Suicidal
11656,11676,I need a reason to continue living. I have the feeling death is the only way for me to find peace I am ready to go but... Please can someone give me a good reason why I should not just kill myself right now,Suicidal
25964,25984,I am stuck and just never should have been born I hate myself and my family so much I want to die,Suicidal
25592,25612,People say that you need to at least try and if you failed you know you have tried and there is nothing to regret over. But is not it worst when you try just to find out that you cannot after all? Aka leaving you to feel more helpless and hopelesss Hm?,Suicidal
14440,14460,Tell me anything to convince me to mot do it. I screwed up. Big. No I did not kill anyone but I RUINED something that was really special for me. It kept me going through 2021 even though NOTHINGS changed from 2020. It was pretty much the only thing keeping me sane and I FUCKED IT UP. Its gone. Fucking gone.Literally anyone tell me anything to keep me from downing whatever fucking pills I can down. ANYONE. Literally tell me anything.,Suicidal
8913,8933,You cannot break facts. My life is going to be a mess and I see it. I am afraid of it. Combined with all the other things my life fucked. Socially my personality is weird. The chance of getting ignored is high. I am afraid of it. I really hate it when I indicate that I am suicidal and everyone takes it as a joke or just ignores it. I tried again and again. Nah. Cut people off and no active social interaction at all. it is much better than saying I am not okay and getting ignored. I do not have any feelings. All are gone. I cannot even feel that I am alive. Self harm is the way to feel something. I have no reason to keep going and I just want to die as soon I can. My existence is worthless. Accepting death rather than living,Suicidal
25398,25418,I am 15f and I have already told my mum I wanted to kill myself like a year ago surprised I did not but now I want to again I am not going to go into detail but I have nothing stopping me for one final cry for help I was going to tell my therapist that I am suicidal. I was wondering if she is just going to tell my mum and that is the end of it and nothing happens or does she actually have to call the crisis helpline and get me help because this really is my last chance and if this does not work I will kill myself. Please help Can my therapist send me to a psychiatric hospital?,Suicidal

11012,11032,Two thoughts i would like to share today. How i feel and how i see myself in the future. Maybe I am being selfish coming here with such a small thing but i cannot see myself talking to anyone about this. So i live in the contradiction of having a perfect life and finding no joy in whatsoever. I am only 21 currently in med school i have family a few friends used to get laid sometimes before quarentine have not lost anyone to covid due to our hard isolation. Yet i still feel like nothing can make me happy. Things i used to enjoy are no longer fun and i have no new interests at all... feels like things are not worthy like oh ofc i want to play guitar but uh it takes so much effort i do not want to anymore. Nowadays i just wake up with no motivation whatsoever do the hateful remote college stuff and wait for the night when i cannot sleep and for no reason at all feels so lonely so empty so lacking the reason to wake up tomorrow that i want to seat in the room and drink until i forget who i am and sleep. Tbh even that is denied cuz i have epilepsy and alchool makes me convulse. I do not want to kill myself but i do think about and i figured out i woudnt do it because ending it now feels like a selfish decision to my parents my dog and probably half the world whom would envy my life. When i think of my future on other hand every scenario leads to this I am coming home late night after some pacient die in my hands. Parents deadold enough to care. All by myself getting a drink and finally getting the guts to mix my own damn medications with some other pills. A whole life seeking happiness and just failing finding one single thing that can as spinoza would say increase the bodys power of being I am not suicidal TODAY but anywhere i look into my future i see it there,Suicidal
17605,17625,I have been having a lot of suicidal thoughts recently I have done really well on not remembering my past and closing myself when anything from the past remotely enters my brain. i got a therapist because i want to get better there is a lot of things that makes me want to continue living but i did not know before getting better i have to acknowledge things and overcome things and past traumas. I have done things in the past that i cannot take back or fix most of them a reflection of things that were done to me when i was a kid. I am trying to remind myself that I am not my past and even though we cannot control our past we can control how we react in the present and where to go in the future. but I am so tired these past situations and the feelings i had in them is all coming back and its incredibly overwhelming.i am very fortunate to have loving friends partner and family but my past continues to haunt me.I am stuck between offing myself or continue being sad and tired. i do not want to be sad anymore.,Suicidal
17643,17663,I cut my sister out of a noose earlier. She asked me to put it where she could not get it I tied the rope to a tree and made her show me she could not reach. She got a chair and hung herself they got a small pulse she is fighting for her life a 5050 shot she makes it Not sure this is the right place.. but I really need to say this,Suicidal
20384,20404,So this might be kind of long but here gose. I am 17 i come from a long line of alcoholics and criminals. I use to volunteer and donate time and money and goods. But i got exploited and used so much that i feel like a idiot for ever believing that humans could be good. And the worst part is i have become no better i have become a very severe alcoholic and a thief. And i genuinely enjoy stealing and the thrill that comes with it it is hard to stop. I have already failed i have become no better than who i feared becoming. I am honest to god terrified because i have no friends and no one to talk to. The only reason i have not killed myself already is because I am afraid. I should do it though the world already has enough criminals and alcoholic's. I wish i had someone to talk to but I am to afraid to reach out to anyone. I have become everything i feared.,Suicidal
26117,26137,I just want to live without having to push myself so hard. Regardless I deserve to push myself to death to the point that it drives me nuts to suicidal thoughts. I have made many mistakes and even if I go back in time and fix my past mistakes there will be thousands more mistakes to come. People will tell me that everyone makes mistakes and no one should push themselves so hard! and yet people will get pissed off at me yell at me and hurt physically andor verbally me telling me how much it says about me and not them and how much I deserve the punishment for my mistakes. Its just so fucking ironic lol.Even the littlest mistakes I have made are just so big for me. I am feeling like all mistakes are the same and that my mistakes will be just as bad as others mistakes.As much as I love everyone on this earth this includes my family friends and even everyone in general I do not love myself as much. Perhaps I am just too sensitive for this world. Perhaps I am too different for this world.I may be ignored on this sub but fuck it. Fuck my life fuck my pain and fuck all the cruel shit on this earth. I just want to go home called heaven and let God be able to finally heal me after all the pain and mistakes I have regretted and experiencedI apologized for my profanity. I am still thinking about harming or kill myself I am too sensitive for this cruel earth. Might as well harm or kill myself in the future,Suicidal
9106,9126,I hit my mum today for the first time in a long time. She did not deserve it she never has ever deserved it. I hate myself for the way I have treated her and I wish I could go back and fix everything I have destroyed. People say things to me or provoke me when I am already feeling low and it causes me to fly off the handle and I emerge into someone that I despise. After these episodes I often think about ending my life I do not think I have the guts to. Unless one day I badly hurt someone out of anger because the guilt would consume me. Sometimes I cut myself after these episodes because it seems fair but there is only so much that can do. My mum is a lovely caring woman and everyone in her life treats her like shit including me and I am stuck in this cycle that I do not know how to change. I need help I have fucked up my life.,Suicidal
13381,13401,So it occurred to me today during my morning sob session that no matter what I do I will still because everybody in my life some level of pain. If I stay alive they will watch me crumple and waste away doing nothing.If I kill myself they will be sad in the beginning but it will lessen as time goes on. Maybe even be a relief. Seems like a simple decision to me.Maybe this sounds obvious or silly but it was a little epiphany to me.Opinions? The lesser of two evils,Suicidal
10189,10209,I really want to kill my self. Dealing daily with mental illness and bulimia is taking a toll on me. Life is exhausting And I am in so much pain. I think I might be pregnant which is adding to this despair. I want my life to end but I am too scared to do it.Help. I really want to kill myself.,Suicidal
9966,9986,I went out further than my local store for the first time in many years today. Ever before the pandemic I had not been out in a while due to depression and the increasingly massive weight gain it caused. For years i have been living and working in a small bedroom alone wearing the same pair of ripped leggins everyday. Recently I have been trying to diet and get out of my funk and I thought I was ready to go out and enjoy the day! I made a special effort to dress properly and put on makeup etc. I knew I did not look GOOOD but I thought I was pretty innocuous at least...but I could not even walk a few hundred metres without people making fun of me and mimicking my walk waddle I guessIt happened two separate times this morning and I have been crying ever since. Its pathetic....I thought I was getting better but today has just proved I am not and likely will not without professional help which just is not coming. My mum she is the one who came with me today since I have no friends lol called the mental health crisis team and my GP earlier today both just kind of shrugged and said that thoughts and threats of suicide were not enough for them to intervene I would have to try st first. Now my mum is frustrated because its 1AM and I am still sobbing! She said she is not going to spend time with me like this again because of my bad attitude which means I have absoloutely NOBODY Anyway I hope everyone else is doing better haha. Any tips on how to get through the night without waking my mum up crying again? What should have been a nice day made me realise its time to go,Suicidal
20865,20885,I am really tired like reallyyyyyyy tired of going to sleep every night at 4am and waking up at 6 or 7 and spending the whole day thinking about one person. Every single day suiside is on my mind and when I met my best friend my life shifted but idk if it was for the better or the worse. I love him so fucking much and do not want to see him lose it he is my world and I appreciate evey word he says to me but I am not sure if I can hang on any longer or make it to 16. People have different ways on seeing things and my way of seeing our friendship is that yeah now is strange one we are laughing and doing everything right then stage 2 we start to drift bc things like this do not last forever. Stage 3 we have pretty much forgotten about each other and we just say our final goodbye and wish each other the best I have a bad habit of thinking of the depressing things and one that I always think about is saying goodbye to them. I am sick of having to stay alive it sucks big time and I have given up on my dreams and beliefs and even my future I never asked to be here I hate it here the only thing I like about this place is the dark not like the opposite of light I mean the darkness inside of people the dark that you cannot eliminate the dark that people declared insane crave. I like feeling this way most of the time but sometimes when it gets like this I do not bc ik that if I die someone else will to probably. I think I might do it someday this week bc I will be alone almost always and before anyone is like no stop do not do it ha I am done what people say okay if someone is coming with me its there choice not mine yes I love them and told them not to do anything if I go but I now would like to say that from rn 205am I do not give a fuck anymore if I am going to do it I am going to do it nothing will change that. Good day All good things come to an end eventually,Suicidal
17500,17520,This motherfucker has only been working here for 1 week. I tried to give him tips on how to work efficiently and to make future work easier for both him and others but no. Hes incredibly arrogant and stubborn. Apparently hes been spreading rumors that I take 40 minutes breaks while I was on my off days. This fucking Piece of filth is going after my job. My fucking livelihood. What I use to pay my bills. Hes been here one week. Hes been getting into it with other workers too. But you are NOT GOING TO GO AFTER MY INCOME. I WILL NOT SIT QUIETLY AND LET SOME FUCKING NEWBIE RUIN MY LIFE. THIS PIECE OF SHIT HAS NO GOD DAMN CLUE WHAT I have BEEN THROUGH AT THIS PLACE. HOW HARD I FUCKING WORK AT THIS GOD FORSAKEN PLACE. Sorry. But I have been holding that in all day ever since I found out. Thankfully my supervisor knows how hard I work and trusts me. All I try to do in one day is get to work do a good job and go home. Just leave me alone. do not talk to me. Just let me work. Stay out of my business. You do your work Ill do mine. Leave me alone. Just leave me alone. I do not know what I am going to do. I cannot relax in my own home. Just knowing some shithole is already trying to get me fired after a week of work. Ill admit I was the nicest to the guy but that was after he would not listen to me. After he would argue with me even though I know what I am doing. I lost my patience and started talking back to his passive aggressive comments. I have put to much work into this place to let some newbie talk to me like that. Again sorry for the rant. I have not been in a good headspace ever since I started working here. I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up. Asswipe at work trying to get me fired.,Suicidal
26419,26439,personally the worst feeling I have experienced was having to put my belt back on after using it to try neck myself in the shower. this was a hour again. lost consciousness but sadly did not die. its still wet the worst felling,Suicidal
13582,13602,I annoy my family whenever i open my mouth about a hot take they all come at me make fun of me. Tell me to go to my room cry and scratch myself. I am boring to my boyfriend he probably just talks to me because he feels sorry for me feels like he is obligated. all his replies are blunt and dry anyways. My friends cannot stand me Ik they cannot. they just feel like they owe me because I have been there for them. idk. i can tell they get bothered by me too. I cannot maintain healthy relationships with anyone. And I know its my fault. Everyone is so much more calm and happy when I am not here. People are unbothered they are not annoyed. They can enjoy peace and serenity without this burden always being a thorn in their side. I am so sick of pretending to be strong. Who am I being strong for? Clearly nobody wants me around so why should not I just take myself out. I would just be hurrying the inevitable of me dying by myself with no one around. it would be better if i was not here,Suicidal
19134,19154,A friend of my friend committed suicide today and he is devastated.I also have had a friend pass on from hurting themself but I had no support from anywhere. Because of that I have no idea what would have made it feel better as honestly I am not even sure how I dealt with it.I know there is not a lot of words to be said or things to actually do but sitting in silence does not feel right although I know sometimes silent support is all that is needed.If anyone has any suggestions on what I can dosay it would be greatly appreciated. How do I properly support my friend after his friends suicide?,Suicidal

9586,9606,My day is shit it is going to be shit tomorrow the day after that and the day after that. Why is killing yourself with stress okay but suicide is not seen as okay?,Suicidal
7554,7574,They say suicide is selfish but if i decide why cannot i have the option to die peacefully after a certain age? is not it selfish for everyone to prefer me suffering everyday rather than being peacefully dead? Like if i decide to die do not make me search for weird non guaranteed ways that can leave me seriously crippled give me some amount of mandatory therapy and if a still want to after that let me go.. I genuinely do not get why i need to live i do not want help i want to die,Suicidal
25521,25541,I am not going into details because i do not want that person to find this reddit post. I just feel so heartbroken and my urges are getting worse. I know i am going to try to kill myself again soon. I just hope that this time i succeed. I tried to kill myself yesterday and i lost someone close to me due to my attempt.,Suicidal
11490,11510,I ran away because I could not help it ptsd response. I am so unlovable. I just want to fade away. Every time a car passes by I secretly wish someone would just shoot me. I do not deserve to be alive. I feel like I am forever broken and damaged. No one wants me. I constantly feel stuck and like I have nowhere to turn to. I am stuck even though everyone would secretly be better off and happier without me. Please I just want my misery to be over. I wish I could just keel over and simply vanish. No more pain for anyone. Just peace and happiness. All I do is ruin everything and turn everyone against me. I deserve to jump in front of the next car that comes my way. I hope I accidentally fall I do not deserve to live and I am so unlovable.,Suicidal
16410,16430,I cannot imagine anyone wanting to be in a relationship with me I am an ugly 23 year old who is never had a job or been in a relationship. To make things worse I am a trans woman and have no social skills. I am convinced I will die alone I do not even have any friends. How could anyone love me when I cannot even love myself?,Suicidal
25138,25158,I know that there are people that care for me. On the outside I have a good life. But my mental problems are way too often overlooked. Ever since I started my job I have been extremely stressed. I have at least 1 panic attack every shift and before the work day starts I fantasize of various ways to hurt myself enough to 1. Get out of work and 2. Be seen as mentally ill enough by my parents to get the help I need. I think I will overdose on my antipsychotics tonight. My intention is not suicide and may as well be just attention seeking but I genuinely cannot receive help otherwise. I am simply out of options. Scared of Suicide but out of Options,Suicidal
21043,21063,I fuck up everything. I have shit grades and barely any friends. I had an outburst at my girlfriends party because I got overwhelmed and everything else in my life is going wrong so I feel like just offing myself. Idk how to tell my girlfriend I feel like killing myself when she is mad at me. I just cannot keep doing this.,Suicidal

22897,22917,Idk what to do anymore I either end it now or my life will keep spiraling down until I cannot stand it anymore and end it then. Either way I cannot handle my own emotions. Everyone says I am sensitive just for caring. The only way to feel numb is drugs or death and deaths starting to sound better. I have been like this since I was a kid I do not think it can get better. Being alive feels like a trap. ,Suicidal
17994,18014,I am going through a divorce from an abusive spouse and have relapsed horribly with my ED as well as depression.I am having suicidal thoughts constantly the other day I wanted to take all these pills so badly but I live with my parents so did not want it to be a huge thing.My question is does anyone else feel like they could not possibly be more obvious that they are suicidal and nobody seems to do anything about it? Like if I killed myself there is no way anyone in my life could say we had no idea or we did not see this coming.Want to do an inpatient program but I still have to pay my mortgage and bills for my house states away that my soon to be ex husband is living in. How am I supposed to do that? I have no money saved. I swear if you are depressed its like either let the illness kill you or go bankrupt and ruin every other aspect of your life and then you will probably be even more suicidal. Like really what am I supposed to do? Anyone feel like you could not be more obvious that you are suicidal and no one does anything? And how can I get help when I have financial obligations?,Suicidal
16430,16450,that is all i ask yet it still seems like too much I am at a loss for words and everything else especially for will to live I just really want to be dead that is all there is to say,Suicidal
26727,26747,I posted here yesterday about having uncontrollable obsessions with certain aspects of life and nobody responded guess it just proves my point. I take life too seriously I rarely experience any pleasure or happiness and I am lonely and suicide seems more and more like a legitimate response to all of it. Endless struggle and no idea how to get better,Suicidal
15652,15672,So I am having this weird sort of experience where I am accepting the fact that I will suicide and I am looking forward to the day where I have everything set up just right. ? Okay. Anticipation,Suicidal
20098,20118,I work in fast food because I had to drop out of college because I tried to commit suicide 3 times and was so depressed that I could not go to class. Now it is too late and I failed a lot of classes and cannot go back. I got As in highschool was several years ahead in 2 subjects scored very high on an IQ test and was constantly reminded of how successful I will be by my teachers. Well guess what. I dropped out and make 12hour while also paying my dad the insurance and car money I owe him plus a bunch of bills and do not even have a place. I suffer from malnourishment which causes me to get sick and miss EVEN MORE work. This leads to being even more broke and my bank account hits 0 a week before I get paid. I am 6 feet tall but I weigh 125lbs and can barely lift anything because I am so weak and frail from malnourishment. I have tried doing UberEats to help and it worked but suddenly my car has some issues I cannot afford to fix yet. I am screwed and I am eventually going to die anyway in lots of pain from malnourishment so why not end it now? what is the point of living if I do not make enough to?,Suicidal

21566,21586,I went out with them today and since I am on holidays I will not see them for another week so this seems like the perfect time to tell them since I will not have to deal with them immediately and also it gives them time to process things. But I just cannot get myself to send it I wrote an almost 1000 word ramble about how I feel things I have never told anyone some things that I have bottled up for so long letting go of the one thing I can control is scary. Really I am only planning on telling them the bare minimum which is what I wrote but then they will know and unfortunately the bare minimum is still too much of me that I am giving away to add on to that even though my friends are not the type to do this I am scared that they will share it. In hindsight I really do not need to tell them how I feel but I feel so close to offing myself and I am just searching for something to keep me going. Maybe friends support could help but then I am left alone and vulnerable. I am scared and I do not know what to do I am trying to tell my friends I am suicidal,Suicidal
15491,15511,I cry every day. I talk about killing myself often. I self harm and show people. I tell my therapist about it. I write suicide notes and show people. I tried to do a thing and my partner grabbed the apparatus and asked are you done yet? I let my body weight try to do the job but he never dropped the apparatus. Of course I eventually chickened out first. I say I cannot even pack my clothes myself I am too ashamed. He says Just let me know if you need me to pack your clothes for you and take you and I will. Did I not just say that?My therapist said I believe in your ability to manage your emotions without going inpatient. I asked Do you believe in my ability to not kill myself without going inpatient? You never said you wanted to kill yourself. are not I saying it now?How much louder do I have to get when I can barely breathe? Every time I scream for help and am not heard I choke on more water and lose even more precious air. I am out of reserves now and I am drowning. I am past the point of helping myself I have been doing the work for years in therapy groups leaning on friends and using my coping skills as best I can. I am exhausted yet no better off for it. If one 1 person at my funeral says they are shocked it was so unexpected they never knew so help me God I will Lazarus myself long enough to drag them back to the pits of hell with me. They all know. Are they waiting for it to happen? Its coming I can feel it. I told everyone and it did not matter. People actually do not care to help. Telling a suicidal person to ask for it is sending them on a wild goose chase.,Suicidal
14938,14958,I have spent the past couple days in my head and I am so afraid of getting stuck in there again. I was doing really well letting the past go living in the moment and enjoying life. Today I just feel deflated and empty. I feel soggy and gross.I think it is because I have had an amazing past few months. Senior prom skip day graduation a twoweek trip with my best friend etc etc. And I tried so hard to live in the moment and now that moment is gone. I cannot really be on my own or without constant movement I have learned or I will sink into my old ways.I forced myself out of bed and drove 20 minutes to a park at a marina to go on a walk with my dog but all I could think about was how much I wanted to walk off of the pier and plunge into the water.I have tried to make healthy changes I tried to get fresh air listen to music read books. But I feel like absolute shit right now.I just want to give up right now and just lay down in the grass and melt into it. Grow into a nice tree or something. I just want to be like everyone else sometimes. I do it to myself but I cannot not do it to myself. I love being sad. I love being manic. I love feeling too much or else I do not feel like I am feeling at all. Want to walk off of the pier.,Suicidal
13835,13855,I am going to kms soon i literally do not care anymore no one can convince me to continue living like this Ok,Suicidal
26650,26670,Its exhausting pretending that I want to get better for my parents who are very loving and supportive but its just not true. If I do not end my life before adulthood my life will be full of self destruction that I cannot get away with now since my parents know I cut and I still live at home. Therapy is awful and I cannot help feeling nothing but embarrassed when it comes to explaining stuff. Opening up does not help me it only helps the person on the receiving end feel better to think they can help. I just wish no one cared about me. Id swap places with a kid in a neglectful household in a heartbeat. My family is loving and wants to help and all I end up doing is lying and coldly push them away. I do not deserve nor want support. I only yearn to kill myself and die alone which will probably end up happening anyway regardless.15M I wish people stopped caring and gave up on me just like I gave up on myself,Suicidal

7943,7963,that is normal. Not. I have always hated myself and my life so much ever since i was a kid. Suicidal thoughts ever since i was a kid. It just gets worse the more i age. I am quite broken. My mind tormented and plagued by past trauma and existential crises. it is so appealing to escape the suffering of life and the suffering of my mind. I was planning to travel to some places i really wanted to see before i die. Like the pyramids and the great wall of china. But now I am wondering why bother. I feel a bit like a coward in not wanting to go through with a painful suicide method like hanging. I just want to leave this world peacefully. I am not sure which method yet. Some kind of gas probably that is always been one of the main ones i have been interested in. But there is still quite a bit of preparation you need to do for this method like obtaining the gas and then setting up the method. Whether an exit bag or something. Exit bag sounded good but looking at people in them it seems a bit morbid now. Like your last moments of vision will be in a bag. I am not sure. I am researching about suicide methods on my birthday,Suicidal
10635,10655,Its been a recurring thought throughout my life. I have come to the final conclusion that its long past due. I am sorry to all the people I hurt. I am sorry to the girl I love that I was an awful partner because I had too much shit I just hid and kept under. I am fucking terrible. And its time. I have tried those helplines. They are useless and some of those people do not actually care. I do not deserve to exist,Suicidal

25625,25645,I am here to voice out what is inside my mind because I really have no one to tell. I have been suffering with depressing thoughts ever for almost two decades and this is the only way I can vent out. I hope you guys find solace in this. Here I am breaking down staring at my monitor for the voices of constant suicide does not stop for it is increasing it is magnitude the longer I feel this. This numbing pain is the worst part as it eats away every bit of sanity I have left. Day 1 of 365 days of suicidal thoughts,Suicidal
21715,21735,Last year a coworker jokingly asked me where do I see myself in the next five years. I was honest with him and told him I am not going to be alive by then.I am currently 27 did my first attempt when i was 21. And ever since while I have discovered things that temporarily distract me i do not look forward to anything really I am tired of pretending I have worked exploitative jobs to help around the house because my self esteem simply sabotages me from taking a big leap career wise. I know I will mess up in my first try. To be honest i regret choosing the career i have. Not once brought me joy. But i do not think anything else would have either way.I regret paying for braces. What for? I am going to end up dead anyway. Stupid painful expensive procedure. I feel even worse knowing my mother paid for it and I am going to waste it when I off myself. Same for school same for keeping my long hair same for trying not to drown in rum which does bring temporary peace when I am drunk.I have a very faint fantasy of finding my other half. But it is very faint because who in their right mind would even consider tolerating me by their own free will. I would like to marry wear a pretty dress I would like it red i think it will suit me. But again at this age with all this burden why do i even imagine that. I would like to do many things but I will be wasting somebody is else time. I feel like I am in still water. Just floating by. Waiting for an opportunity to end it all in another city. Maybe i lied that is probably the only thing I look forward to. Thank you for reading. I do not do long term plans,Suicidal
9133,9153,i think I have lost all my friends my family hates me and i have no one. i wish i could just get out. living to 18 seems impossible right now. it feels like no one would notice if i died so what is stopping me from doing it right now? i do not know how much longer i can live. i need help and no one cares enough to give me that help. talking to someone would not even help i just do not have any other options. its a terrible fucking feeling to see other people my age having an amazing time with their friends and I am just here. barely surviving. i cannot live anymore,Suicidal
19508,19528,26F. Outwardly I am completely fine. Great job with upward mobility homeowner supposed to get married in October to a man who truly loves and supports me and is my childhood best friend and I love him so much. Inside I cannot go an hour without thinking about how much I want to die. I suffer from horrible OCD and anxiety. I have habits that I have to do to keep my family members from dying. I used to randomly text people at 3AM to see if they were okay. I am basically just always waiting for something bad to happen and I was barely sleeping for years. I think I was running on a high from all my anxiety for a long time because I never was depressed. Suddenly all I want to do is stop being anxious and I think the only way is to die. I sleep a lot to keep from feeling anxiety. I take naps in the middle of the workday when I used to be a workhorse. I am so so tired of this. I try to talk to my therapist and she agrees I am tired but does not think I am really suicidal. If I try to talk to someone in my family who is kind of falling out and fighting a lot about it they say I feel sad sometimes too or you have to let things roll off instead of taking me seriously. My fianc is very concerned and wants me to maybe go inpatient but I do not want to I went once as a teenager for OCD and it was awful. Clearly nothing will ever help me. Family therapy in patient literally getting married. I have even tried picking up a hobby. I would just feel horrible leaving my fianc alone. that is the only thing that stops me. I used to have my nephews and nieces to think about but ever since my family started falling out I do not even really have that. I am honestly just rambling at this point and I have no idea why. I am always just rambling about stupid shit which is probably why no one gives a shit when I say I am suicidal. I do not know why doing lifes so hard for me,Suicidal
10661,10681,I am so upset with what my life has come to. I really want to die sometimes. I want to meet God and be happy forever. This life Is full of pain. I am going back out on my balcony now. Stood on my balcony in the pouring rain for an hour and just cried,Suicidal

11986,12006,I just want to be rid of them. I have worked so hard to recover been through multiple outpatient programs to try and recover from the psychological havoc they put me through and lately I have finally been feeling great and optimistic for the first time in years. And then this bomb dropped on me. I think they are not going to stop until they can watch me completely crumble and die. I do not want to give them that. But I am starting to worry that I will never be free of them and that I will never feel safe. I will always have to protect myself from them. they will try to get to me any way they can. that is not a life I want to endure. My abusive ex is lying about me sexually assaulting them to get revenge for outing their abuse and I am thinking of killing myself.,Suicidal

24207,24227,context I want to attempt and failNot on here or in real life. Another Redditor told me my friends and family will give me the obligatory sympathy and then just kind of push it aside. So now I am conflicted if I actually want to fail or really die. Both sounds good tbh. Like honestly. Either way the outcome is its going to be good. If I attempt and fail people will realize how bad it actually is. If I attempt and succeed all my problems are solved immediately. And even if I actually did it eventually nobody would care,Suicidal
13207,13227,I met her on twitter in 2018. Right after my only friend killed himself and I was about to do the same. I said goodbye to my followers and she immediately messaged me and managed to stop me. We became friends in the following years. We have never met and never even talked on the phone. But she is the only person I know and the only person I care about.Over the past year i have developed strong feelings for her. I did not told her because I did not want to lose her. But she noticed it anyway. We had a long talk but she is not comfortable with my feelings. I do not even want her to feel the same. I know I am not worth loving. She told me it will be better if we stop it right now. I do not wanted this to happen. I lost my job in noverber and I am to sick to find a new. Was in psychiatry in january and february. it is getting worse and worse. Now I lose the only person in my live. I am so lost. I cannot stand this anymore. In this world there is nothing left for me. I want to leave so bad. Nobody will notice if I do it. The only person I talk to dumped me because I love her,Suicidal
24467,24487,To live is not something I will survive even how hard I try I always fall back into the thought should I take my life? I am still here but not for too long. I am scared of death but its the only thing that makes me feel safe . Take my life and Ill give you money,Suicidal

11420,11440,Sooooo... thanks to the quarentine and my own stupidity I am not doing so well but my last chemestry grade was just sad 44 out of 100.And I can recover it if I work really hard even thought I did that and fail. But my mom is already disapointed with me and the person I become and I can take it i do not want her to realize that I am a useless piece of garbage! So my solution to that and my other problems is just giving up and killing myself.I know it might soud dramatic but the only thing I could do right and make my mom slightly proud was that and now i fuck it up. sorry for the long and confusing text that might not make sense Well....fuck,Suicidal
10685,10705,I have been struggling with these thoughts my whole life I am a 20 year old female I did not have the best childhood and I know that comes with the trauma and the thoughts and having to heal But I have been to therapy I have taken my meds i reach out I have even institutionalized myself and its just so lonely. I live with my sister and grandmother and I am 100 sure not a single soul would check up on me to even find out maybe after 2 days? 3 days? if i do not leave my room maybe they would wonder but none of my friends would think its abnormal and please do not say reach out to someone I have reached out to everyone and anyone around me if someone wanted to be there they would be and i do not blame anyone for not being there because its their choice its a lot to deal with when someone is feeling well like ending it because what else is there. My whole life has been full of abuse and just being there for myself I have taught myself everything even just basic hygiene shit I have a full time job I make pretty good amount of I have traveled I have seen other countries and states i meet people and i go out i try to distract myself but when i get home that void is there and its been there longer than I can remember the earliest I have felt these thoughts I was merely 5 years old and they have never left and I am not worried about people missing me I truly feel and believe the loss of my life would not effect people. there is not a single soul that comes to mind that I think would even think about my death for even a week and i have no one to talk to so I have just been reading posts on here and thought id let it out i do not know what else to do,Suicidal

11144,11164,This is the third day without eating and drinking. Though' will be enough to die but I do not feel any pain or at least is not like the kind of pain you get from when you are hit or cut yourself it is more like a cold as when you are sick but being more dizzy and tired with high temperature. Sometimes my heart ache and random places from my body but I am still resisting and thinking like nothing changed at all. This also made me think it must be the best possible way to die but not entirely sure. Will be more painful as the time passes? How can be worse from now on?Not a nativeenglish speaker so I struggle sometimes writting grammatically and finding the right words not do I care anymore at this point. How does actually feels dying of thirst?,Suicidal
26273,26293,I cannot find a job. I do not know a single person my age that is able to live independently. I do not know anyone that has a job in their field of choice. I am afraid of being raped again. I am afraid of someone calling the police on me for having a public meltdown again. The fucking ocean is on fire AGAIN. I cannot go outside because of how hot it is. I am disabled and will never get better. Everyone I know has been raped at least once in their life or sexually assaulted. Is life just one trauma after the other? I cannot help but think this way. My life has been littered with molestation and rape ever since I was 4. I live in the United States. I have seen three shootings upclose. I have seen so many people die. I am only 21 is it always going to be like this? How do other people continue to live when the world is literally constantly on fire? I feel like its only time before I am sexually assaulted again. I am afraid of leaving my house. I cannot get anything done. How does everyone do it? why is life just one trauma after the other?,Suicidal
23417,23437,You know how suicidal people sometimes give away prized possessions? I tried and it seems no one wants them. I have things belonging to my grandparents and father who have passed away but my family does not want them. I do not have many of my own things. Nothing really important to me besides a ring Ill send to my mom the day I take my own life. I live 2000km away from my family and I do not have many friends. Certainly none who want my parents wedding gift dishes. I wish my mother never brought those things here to me. They are going to be thrown in the garbage now. My whole life in little keep sakes in a steamer trunk and a rubber made tub. I am sending them gifts instead. I do not have much money so I thought Id save up and send them something they would like maybe. Something positive out of all my negative. I find I am on auto pilot now. I gave away just about everything I own. All I have are books and some clothes. A camera and my steamer trunk. Even if its not by my own hand Ill die soon anyway. How odd it is that I am afraid to die when I have wanted to for so long. I am unhealthy. I am very overweight. I can hardly walk and even laying down too long hurts. I do not have faith that I can fix it. I think I am too far gone to come back and be.. better? I told myself Id try harder to get better mentally and I did try but here I am planning what happens leading up to and after my death. It should not matter what happens to my few belongings. Maybe its just another tree in my path to getting what I want. I am not a religious person. I do not know if there is an afterlife. I hope there is not. I hope I do not have to look back on my life or be punished in some sort of hell. I hope I just stop existing. Like a light going out. Its just gone. I get that I am crazy.

17909,17929,For everyone who does not live in the Netherlands a dutch crime reporter called Peter R de vries has been shot a week ago and died today I feel bad for his family his friends and all his coworkers.He did the best things ever like finding people who murdered young kids and always being there for their grieving parents he also crowdfunded millions of euros for someone knowing what happened to a missing girl.He did not deserved to be shot if there is someone who deserves to be shot it will be me.I was extremely cruel to animals between the age of 4 and 11 I almost killed a bunch of newborn kittens at the age of 5 I bullied little kids 6 years younger than me at age of 11 and my life sucks anyway by dealing with being bullied for being fat and ugly mostly in high school and currently on the streets and having a dad with alzheimer's who has treated me like shit if I was there in Amsterdam with Peter R de vries I would have jumped in front of him so the bullet would have hit me instead of him because he did not deserved it he is a good person.Not me I am the scum of the earth and deserve a bullet between my eyes. Why the fuck do good people always die earlier than bad people like me? I have been suffering from my mistakes and my life right now and I am a psychopath living with depression. I do not blame my high school bullies and strangers on the streets for calling me fat and ugly because they are right. I am the biggest mistake ever ugly and cruel.If I could give my life to let Peter live I would do it. Dutch crime reporter Peter R de vries did not deserve to die but I do,Suicidal

22535,22555,what the fuck is the point? my best friend moved across the GLOBE. she was the only person i could just get up and go hang out with. and now she lives on the other side of the atlantic. i just started a job so I am not really chummy with my new coworkers. my bf just went up north again for some conference and is already back to his shit texting. hes being short and abrupt with me. I am so tired. I am so tired of school. it will be like 3 more years before i can even start my career. and my bf is going to break up with me as soon as school starts so he can have his college experience aka fuck other women and men. i am wasting my life.what is even the point of breathing?so i can continue this stupid life overweight? so i can continue to surround myself with ppl who do not care? I am done hurting. i just want peace. why even live if this existence is exhausting,Suicidal
9445,9465,i do not want to die i just want to be at peace. i spend all of my free time asleep. i do not even know how my body can sleep as much as i do but man is it comforting. there is nothing more comforting than being asleep. even with my extreme nightmares every night i would not trade that feeling of bliss for the world. i wish i could feel it forever. i just want to sleep forever,Suicidal
23786,23806,I do not fit in.Everything is ripping me apart like always.I went to a proper party for the first time in my life and probably for the last time a guy I know that has a girlfriend for several years was completely fucked up dancing and making out with everything that has legs meanwhile his best friend is knocked out downstairs sitting in some corner puking himself and him not even giving a shit even though he knew on the other side of the house some guys are smashing in their skulls and everyone is encouraging them and everywhere there is random people making out.Meanwhile I am standing in the middle of everything looking around and asking myself if this is life if this is the fun everyone is talking about it is not even like I did not try to have fun I drank as much as everyone else if not even more because I am 185cm tall and weigh 90kg so I thought I might need a bit more than everyone else but all the alcohol did not do shit I could not stand up properly but my mind did not change yeah I was a bit more open but only because I knew that everyone else had a toddlers brain because of all the alcohol.That party just again showed me how different I am and how much I do not fit in with people like that I maybe was not as suicidal as always but that is because of all the people around and probably because of the alcohol but I was sad even more than always I was sad that I am right with my thinking about humans that everyone is egoistic and an asshole I was sad that a guy that had a beautiful gf was more desperate than a virgin that never touched a girl so desperate that he forgot his friends the world and life around him just to have fun with drunk girls that are not even going to remember anything.And I am back to my routine again I again did not make any progress with finding something that is fun that brings me joy or hope no it is the complete opposite it just showed me the real world and that I am not made for it why? God knows was I born like this? Did puberty do this to me? Did mental illness do this to me? Are my eyes just open because of depression or is my brain just roasted and I am delusional? Or am I simply just a loser?And again I know that I am better off alone and even better off dead so I can finally have peace and silence in my head. Am I a loser because I have depression or do I have depression because I am a loser.,Suicidal
13780,13800,Just act crazy and swing around weapons or a unloaded gun and they will pull their guns out and make me droplike a bag of potatoes. They shoot to kill so it would definitely work. Also majority of cops are emotionally detached and enjoy using their handguns. They will not get fired because its hard for them to get canned. Idk why suicide by cop is not more prominent when its so easy. Suicide by cop will probably be my choice of method due to it being stupidly easy in the United States,Suicidal

21095,21115,I am tired I do not even know where to start but I am tired. Ever since I was little my dream has been studying and becoming a professional in a career I can be proud of. I was the type to take college classes in high school so I could expedite the process. When I got the opportunity to move the USA at the age of 15 of course I said yes. Yes dad! Of course I want to go. The land of opportunity the land of the free. It has been more than 10 years and I have been anything but free. I am 26 years old and I have not started my career. I am an illegal immigrant. I cannot graduate drive or work unless I do so illegally which has never been my desire breaking the rules has always been my worst nightmare. Doing the wrong thing completely paralyzes me. I do not suppose dad knew what he was doing when he moved us to this country. And yes I could have left but it does not work like that in our family where the man of the house is the ruler and tyrant. Leaving meant having nowhere to go with no roof over my head or food in my stomach. I have always struggled to make friends I guess they all have sensed the brokenness that is in me and ran the other way. As the months go by my interest in people diminishes. I want to be left alone. do not talk to me do not look at me do not breathe on me please ignore all this and love me anyways. Just give up on me and leave please fight for me. I understand I am hard to love which makes this decision a little easier. Dad even though you were tough on me I know you were just as broken as me. I do not want to follow in your footsteps. I tried. I really tried. But I am you. Mom I love you so much and I am sorry. You do not deserve to lose your only daughter but I cannot do this anymore. Hubby. You have tried your best to be patient and be there for me. But my presence is a burden that you do not deserve to handle. I hope you find love again. I know you will with that light that shines through you. I have realized that a life in which I contribute nothing but pain and strife is not worth living.I hope it will be a light painless death. I will sleep and hope to never wake again. My Suicide Note,Suicidal
13411,13431,I do not know who I am. Sometimes I am the son of my parents the one who exists solely to make them proud. Other days I am the employee at work and the coworker so my friends. Sometimes I am a college student who is only purpose is to excel. there is always a day when I realize I am nothing. I feel worthless I cannot stand these different sides trying to pull me towards them. I hate myself I hate them but all I can do is cry about it. Sometimes I feel so emotionless that the world may as well not even exist but other times I feel as if I take everything on myself the pain of those around me and I shove mine down to make room for theirs.But no matter how hard I try it feels as if no one truly cares. No one gives me a second thought. That I am nothing to those around me. No one hates me more than me no one is more disappointed in me than me. The world is a pool of despair and I take it all on. One day Ill pass from this world and I cannot help but hope that day comes soon because when it does my pain is finally over. Whatever exists beyond this world has to be better I sincerely hope it is. Because I am tired of suffering. EmotionlessOverly Emotional,Suicidal

13201,13221,Hi I am Jen and I am 30 and writing personal farewell letters to my few friends family and mom and I do not feel anything. Have you ever cried emotionless? Like.. tears are just running out of your eyes just like that? I am never officially diagnosed because I live in the Netherlands and we have a waiting list that is huge. And I heard that if you finally get help they put you in group sessions to clean up the waiting lists. How to reach out for help when the whole system does not even work or takes it serious? I am not going to do group sessions where I am talking for 5 minutes and listening to strangers for the other 55. I got some sessions when I was still in school but they were against my will and with some woman staring at the ceiling for an hour long. I also feel I do not even deserve help or that what I feel is not real or is just an exaggeration because that is what I am told all my life. Also my mom calls me boring occasionally ' I was never really confident although I figured out how to mask it quite well from my late teens until my mid twenties. I kind of felt good or okayish with this made up personality after being bullied in middle school for 4 years but it was tiring. I started getting really bad in 2018 again my dad died in 2017 and my dog the year after but I kept up a positive front but going downhill on the inside the more time passed. Covid completely tipped me over the edge..I guess.. idk.. I cannot take it anymore and I do not even know what the because is anymore of me being like this. I just feel so empty and hurt at the same time.At night I imagine myself slowly dying.. this is how I manage to fall asleep because it feels comfortable imagining this is it I am not waking up tomorrow. I punch myself in the head when I cannot fall asleep or when feelings become overwhelming because I do not want to bother anyone with this so I keep it to myself and take it out on myself. I can feel happy tho but those are only short bursts of something that feels like happiness because even that feels not real to me. They usually only last for an hour or so before I am back to this..ehh.. default state of mind? I am so tired but at the same time I feel as if I am being chased. I do not know what I am doing on this ball of dirt I feel lost. I needed to get this off of my heart I hope you are all safe just a scream in the void from a random stranger Very long,Suicidal
18639,18659,I have a family that loves me a few close friends and I even have the means to got to an alright college. Despite all that all I can think about is killing myself and it makes me feel like a spoiled piece of shit. This leads to me hating myself which makes me want to die which only repeats the cycle. I wish my life was shit so I would not feel bad about wanting to kill myself,Suicidal
9837,9857,I am 35 I have never owned a vehicle I have only ever dated one girl and that was over 13 years ago. I have only ever been passionate with 2 woman and the 2nd was a lesbian. I do not own anything and I have never paid my taxes. My teeth are falling out but I do not drink often or do many drugs other then occasional weed when my mind starts spinning and I need to calm it. I spent my whole youth in front of a computer screen I am 250lbs and I have a horrible time in social situations I almost always embarrass myself to the point that I feel uncomfortable even being in crowds. I have been on tinder for over a year and only ever had 20 matches and 2 replies. I am not very attractive. I am going to die alone I have no future to look forward to my job is physically demanding with very little pay and long hours. I was at peace with the notion of growing old and dieing even if it is alone but lately I find myself wondering if life even holds meaning enough to carry on for the few people that still know me. My only 2 friends only bother with me once in a while. If I chose to live it will only be in misery and sorrow. Why would I want a long lonely road ahead. I do not know,Suicidal

12129,12149,Hi Reddit I will go straight in. I am 16 going through the 9th year of my depression and I am starting to lose hope. My life has fallen into hell I am currently contemplating as to what to do with my life while the doubts in my head cloud my vision. This my desperate attempt to find the will to live again. This year has been the hardest year for me yet backstabbed casted aside and neglected has left me all scarred with no will left to live and every moment I breath feels like a mistake. I do not know what to do anymore I do not fear Death but I do not know why I can bring myself to jump. If anyone is out there please help me. That is all goodluck everyone Please help me find hope,Suicidal
19721,19741,I have always been the one that helps to the ones that i think needs help. I offer mine even if they did not ask because i know what it feels like to bottle up emotions. I know when they need help because i see myself in them. I helped 2 people go through depression. I tried my best to be the wall they could lean on. One was the person i loved anne. And the other one was one of the closest friends I have ever had jhane. There have been times when i wanted to ask for help but i knew that anne was busy with her life. she is already facing alo't of problems and i know she does not have time to listen for me. And I have lost already lost contact with jhane as she is already happy and also she now has a boyfriend. I am afraid to ask her as I am a guy. I do not want to be another issue for them as i know how important this relationship is to her. I know... I do not know actually. I guess I am just afraid to ask. I do not want to ask anymore because the everytime time i asked for help it felt like i was talking to someone made of ice. It always felt cold and uncaring. Whenever i ask for help and i see them busy and happy and i just did not want to disturb them. It always just ends up being the same. I ask how they are then i see them busy and happy then i lose the will to ask for help because i do not want to be an annoyance to them. I am afraid. I tried to help everyone i could but i could not even help myself.,Suicidal
14749,14769,I feel like there is no other solution. To all that shit I have been through the trauma. I cannot get over anything. I cannot process what is happening to me and the memories are slowly piling up.I never realized how fucked up my life's been up until I started therapy.

12345,12365,I 33M am tired of emotionally abusive and controlling parents. I am already suffering from daily thoughts of suicide. And have attempted once when I was a minor. My current circumstances especially financial dictate that I cannot just up and leave my situation. Death seems like the only escape from this. I am a failure in the eyes of all who know me. The only time I feel safe is when I am asleep. I cannot go on like this. I am too scared to tell anybody lest they decide to use involuntary detention on me. My mother has threatened me with it multiple times. I want to end my life but am too scared of failing and ending up worse off in a lunatic asylum. .,Suicidal
8417,8437,I am 16. I failed 10th grade because of struggling with online school and now I am on probation for truancy for 6 months. That really is not that big of an issue for me because I can pass the drug tests and I am a mostly behaved kid. My parents are divorced and they do not get along at all. I see my dad maybe 23 times a month and its only ever for a few hours. He beat me once when I was young and I had a horrible stepmom who neglected me and verbally abused me for years. He never got in trouble as my mom did not press charges but that and my stepmom basically ruined our relationship. I have a girlfriend with severe depression and anxiety issues. I will not go into specifics for her sake but Ill just say her alcoholic father caused a lot of her trauma. This girl means the world to me and I want her for as long as I am alive but i just do not know anymore. She smokes weed and vapes and it kills me to watch it. I always try to convince her to stop but she says you know what you signed up for. When I try to talk about it she makes me out as the bad guy every time. It genuinely crushes me like nothing else. All but 1 of her friends are what Id consider addicted to weed and nicotine and they are horrible influences. I try to tell her she needsdeserves better friends and then she calls me controlling. I truly am not controlling I just want the best for her. Her mom and I have discussed it and she agrees with me. Idk it just feels like I am trapped but do not want to escape. I just got my first job at Kohls and i get paid 10hour more than minimum wage so I feel like I should be happy but honestly I just do not care. I feel like my life is just running on repeat. Same bs day after day and I am so tired. I do not have the guts to end my life but I just want it to stop. I feel lost and alone and like nothings worth it anymore,Suicidal
25511,25531,There are a lot of pills in front of me and I am going to try this again um idk I just do not want to do this anymore. I am so uncomfortable all the time with myself its so irritating to have to be me it almost makes my skin crawl. I have tried this many times before and Id like to make it easier on myself but I do not see any other way. I think that its either I kill myself or I end up annoying or hurting every one else. I do not want to have to be alive to lose anyone else either. Pills,Suicidal
24589,24609,I do not know what to say.I have been suicidal pretty much since the start of my teenage years. I do not know if I have depression or not but suicide is the only thing I am able to think about. I have fun with my friends and I think they like me too and I am dating a beautiful girl.I feel like I should be thankful for all I have but all I can think about is ending my life. My left arm has self harm scars that I have subconsciously trained myself to hide.I have scanned online forums for methods and now I find myself adding materials for my chosen method to my Amazon cart.I have had a desire to exit that has only grown with time.

11500,11520,The crushing loneliness. Arguments. People lying to me using me. Being the backup plan. My mom who had cancer with a high risk of return.I am done man I am turning 21 coming Tuesday and I do not care! I really do not give a shit. What is everyone elses summer break? Partying hooking up getting to know new people.Mine is the same everyday. Get up play video games. Be mad at everything wallow in sadness and envy. August comes and its back to the grindstone for college until the day comes I graduate and I can slave away for corporations until I am in my late 60s considered useless and die. My parents who are the only people I can honestly say are my only rays of light in this world will not be here forever and realistically will pass away once I am in my late 30s or 40s.I have so much to say and so much to tell but what it all comes down to is that I am so done. So mentally exhausted Id rope myself if I had the fucking balls to do it which I lack. I cannot destroy my parents and sister like that the annoying question of but what if it gets better later? in my head which is basically me holding a carrot in front of my own face and the survival instinct to stay alive.I do not know what do. I am fucking done with this shit but I lack the courage to do it,Suicidal
22673,22693,Please for the love of god someone interact with this. I know it is not healthy but I really need it. I have been living and working these past few years in the Hopes that eventually things will be solved. What things you ask? Well I will list them off here really quickly.1. Hate my body everything about it from my face to my stomach to my dick. Everything is the exact opposite of everything I want it to be and it IS impossible to change.2. I am going to die someday and all I have ever done will be rendered meaningless.3. I do not love things like everyone else does. I do not love real people and the people I do love I cannot be with because they are not real.For years and years I have been living life off of the belief that these problems will have a solution. I have done the liberty of listing the solutions as well.1. Maybe far off in the future I will be able to switch bodies through brain transplant to something I want. Maybe I will be able to construct a robotic body of my own.2. Maybe someday they will make a way to become immortal or find a way to resurrect the long dead. And I will be able to continue enjoying the life I have loved so much.3. Maybe even further off in the future they will invent a way to travel through dimensions and I will be able to be with someone I really love.I have believed these things really I had hope. But I have had it thrown in my face. I have been told everything I have hoped for everything I ever wanted is impossible. I do not want my life to end I love it so much. But it is going to end and I cannot sleep knowing that it will. I cannot do anything knowing that everything I have ever wanted is impossible. I cannot live knowing this. Please I am begging whatever person is reading this anyone at all. I am trying anything to stay positive but I am going to die anyway,Suicidal
