50656,Anyone else have nothing in common with other people? When I see normal people constantly talk and have fun with it I'm genuinely shocked. How the hell do they have something to talk about all the time?? How do they know what would be interesting to the person they talk to?It feels like I operate on lvl 1 of social skills while everyone else is already on lvl 100. Nobody around me has the same lvl so I can't even train to become stronger doomed to lose every encounter.,Personality-disorder
50657,Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives listening indirectly to their conversations while in public being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost in a way that no one could see me nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.Some of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life just some sort of play or movie.These days I been having the classic I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog idea and daydreams and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature never having to deal with socialization again only brief interactions for let's say buy necessary stuff from other people which I don't mind. I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.I guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection where I could be myself openly and comfortably but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry. I don't have patience for people anymore I'm tired I'm being judgy as hell and I'm activelly avoiding new people.,Personality-disorder
50659,I am hurting Lately I just feel like garbage. I havent left the house much in like 2 weeks and I've been missing class. It all feels too overwhelming for me but being at home makes me feel like trash too...I cant win. I cant sleep right either. I wake up every other hour and im so tired....I feel so angry and anxious lately too because I feel as if everyone hates me and that they're happier without me. My friends hardly talk to me lately. I see them on social media chatting and making plans to callplay games and im never included lately. Im not surprised though. Who'd want to be friends with someone as depressed and broken as me?I want to crawl in a hole and disappear ,Personality-disorder
50660,I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer most aspects of the job are too triggering and I cant handle it.Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 030 minutes of work the previous day I have no update to give I panic and have to lie and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame guilt and stress. Its already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do with the code or on Slack has a timestamp a notification and is visible to everyone. Once theres something Im avoiding committing code deploying code posting the code for review responding to someone testing code an upcoming meeting etc. I often go offline from inactivity and then Im afraid to even open my laptop which can take hours to overcome because once I do everyone can see Im online on Slack my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people Im not responding to my manager.I already got in trouble for not doing my work missing meetings not responding to people for days or weeks and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a monthlong probation which Ive gotten past only because I didnt ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend Im struggling way less than I am. I cant admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing or how much communicating with people the most important part of the job so fundamentally terrifies me.I know every trick in the book about procrastination time management breaking down tasks but thats not enough when Im this afraid of people. Ive accepted I need help from another person. Ive talked about this some with friends but none of them understand so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and Ive been trying to find a therapist but theyve all been unhelpful many actively harmful.I know it's a slow process but every single day at work is like torture and Im on very thin ice. Because I cant get the work done its not endurable and I dont have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I dont want to quit because I havent been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job for the same reasons. But I cant stay like this for months until I find someone and begin making progress.I dont know what to do,Personality-disorder
50661,AE feel like this? Im 24 and dont have a stunningly high body count it never used to bother me but once i hit my 20s and people i knew hit that phase of sleeping around and doing the casual relationship thing it just hooked into my brainI tried to do the whole hoe phase thing but im terrified of everything around being more intimate with someone making moves doing things right my own body just not being able to keep up the act ive got going and having to have someone see all of me you know? and on paper i know its fine not everyone on earth is hoeing it up either side of the spectrum is fine but my brains really latched onto this as another thing that makes me different from everyone else and something people are going to judge me for. like im not a person because no ones ever really wanted me. amp every time someone brings it into conversation i just feel physically sick with how much of the biggest freak i feel like im sorry if this barely makes sense i just really needed to get this off my chest,Personality-disorder
50662,How to deal with inperson avoidance? Hi dear community!I have a question my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.And I noticed that when hes going through an anxiety episode or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.For example if he feels embarrassed or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will hide behind his laptop or walk behind or in front of me distancing himself physically while still being kind its more of a way of hiding from me when he cant actually leave. For example when we share a hotel room on vacationI did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking that he does reciprocateeven when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but Im not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it or if he likes it that Im gently being reassuring and consistent.My dear AvpdErs when feeling low do you like being comforted or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!Thanks everyone !!,Personality-disorder
50664,Expressing myself I feel like Ive had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. Its that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort. I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the fake it til you make it strategy. Although I became more conventionally likable it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But Im trying something different.Its very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling say it put it out there in some way for better or worse. Also treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.As I said its challenging and not always doable this is because A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.But regardless I realize that this is what I have to do and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing whats on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment rejection etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said but whether or not that is true isnt important.Ive been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music writing and drawing and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.Anyway Im tired of pretending. Im not sure if I will ever be able to speak without fear and shame but at least I wont have to strain myself into a safe caricature. Maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but I hope someone relates or understands.,Personality-disorder
50665,An absence of social pleasure social anhedonia It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone elses body but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. It is rare that I enjoy a persons company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people I cant deny this but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. To say it different I dont feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default being alone is peaceful and ideal. Is it really anhedonia or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I cant feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others. Wish I understood so that I could participate more in life.,Personality-disorder

Granted covid did happen as I started. Still dont know if it could have been different for me Im bitter to say the least.Both times it was something like thisFirst year I try to fit in but get all stressed out. People reach out a little I either avoid it or get in the situation act awkward and get back to avoiding.Second year I get a nervous break down heavy paranoia and practically speak to nobody. People stop reaching out.Third year I feel a little better in a who cares anyway kind of way I try to act like a normal person again but people make an effort not to even come in contact with me.

I mean I really dont feel good I didnt lie its just not a physical illness.What I am suprised is that she instantly also said that we can meet next week.

50675,Feel like a leech Sometimes a song stops me in my tracks and this is one of themhttpsm.youtube.comwatch?vWjxIuZVgjp8.My mother would tell me Im exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. She called me a sociopath someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my familys lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldnt know about. Its been the foundation of all of my relationships with others and helps explain why I get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. Trying to connect while thinking Im secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that Im taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. That everything I say is actually calculated and manipulative despite me being unaware of this. That my side of the story isnt just shameful and wrong its evil and vile.Avoidant with BPD is contradictory hell. Im hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships I can keep so they dont leave me. Im unbelievably stressed because Im so close to disaster. I hate to vent to my best friend of several years because I feel like Im being too greedy of her time. I feel like Im sucking off all the meat of this relationship taking up the space for my troubles and then I dont even improve. I know shes going to leave when she discovers Im actually a terrible person and that I dont change. I can feel it creeping towards me and I want to die.I feel like shes only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like Ive somehow manipulated her into thinking Im a nice person. I feel like Im so much worse than she thinks. I cant understand why someone would care about me other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I cant believe the situation Im in. It happens every single time and I never learn.I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like Ive done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth.

50680,I think I have AvPD avoidant personality disorder I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off Im very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping. I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. Im not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level. I dont really open myself up to anyone. Im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. Im close enough with my parents that I dont get anxious around them however I still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. I have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. Whenever Im at work I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience I overthink everything and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like Im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when Im asked questions and I dont feel like Im much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by. I play it safe. Ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like its more than just that.,Personality-disorder

I do have family but they all live far away and I dont see them often.So sometimes I cant help but wonder what would happen if I ever have a stroke or a heart attack or if I fall down the stairs or if I choke on some food I often read about people being found dead in their home several years or even decades after they died and deep down Im convinced thats how Ill end up.

But beyond that its like I have no personality. The only reason I can survive my office environment at work right now is because of an actual real and positive coworker. She has the personality that I wish I had easy to talk to and very kind. But shes leaving tomorrow.So Ive been faking my entire self.

50686,I'm screwed maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.The average person is socially active whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.I'm incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career life experiences life skills energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,Personality-disorder

50688,Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. Even then the relationships I do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.,Personality-disorder
50690,Storytime... Hey so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there most of us are still there let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. Alright so I was showering thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!So basically I'm part of a church group and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't liketrust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. Though I don't share everything these people are genuine and kind and they always make me feel safe. It's just that I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me. So as part of going on the trip I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team 9 people including me. I trust love and feel safe with everyone on this team and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. Anyways the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small mostly funny slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles my past my family all of it. And these are my friends they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though the medicine is kind of iffy really. Anyways I'm super anxious about it especially since I did something similar last year but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year I was so empty and emotionless. But of course nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. But it's not like that that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy. I'm much better now but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay but as soon as I was behind closed doors I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though everyone of us is sharing our testimony no matter how much it hurts we're going to be here for each other.If you've actually read this far I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.,Personality-disorder

She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby her father was also a race car driver before helped her achieve big things but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. My best friend is so fckin smart she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart all of his grade averages are 95 100 is the highest in my country. I'm surrounded by smart and talented people with a future people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself while they're here working their ass off for their future.My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away. I'm gonna be 20 in october my teen years are finally over. I didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are supposed to experience. I can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.,Personality-disorder

In classes in coffee shops in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. It is the profound feeling of alienness.gtAt any moment in the group conversation something in me snaps. I look around the table at the other people blissfully talking and I do not feel like one of them. I am not one of them. I am different a foreigner an alien a stranger in a strange land.gtAnd then the urge to run away to hide to be away from the people comes up. Sometimes I fight the urge and stay on hiding my vast discomfort. Other times I do run away cursing the cowardice and the shame miserable in my misanthropy but secure in my solitude.gtThere is something in the faces in the voices of the others that I do not have. They are into the conversation. They live outside themselves I live inside myself. They talk listen and laugh I think listen and smile.gtThey are relaxed. I am not. I am never relaxed except when Im alone. Solitude is the only place where I can ever truly be known.gtYet I am not content with this. For the real me is lonely desperately lonely longing for intimacy friendship and love. I long to be able to relax to laugh to talk and converse amiably with other human beings. But I cannot. I idealize them in private and fear them in public.gtFear...fear drives the haunted mind. Fear tortures me gnaws at me and chases me from nearly everything I crave the most. But not even fear can conquer the longing the desperate longing the aching striving for meaning in life for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged the dreams unshared the life unnoticed.gtWhen I am alone I wish I was other people. When I am with other people I wish I was alone. This contradiction is slowly but ruthlessly destroying my soul.,Personality-disorder

50696,How can I function with unwanted thoughts that don't go away? I am 22 years old and male. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and I relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with. I spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts. Can anyone relate? How can I function like this?,Personality-disorder

50700,How common is this for people with AvPD? Sorry I'll try to keep it relatively short.I'm a 31yearold male and I've never been diagnosed with AvPD but while reading about the symptoms a month ago things finally made sense to me why I act a certain way. I thought I just had some kind of social anxiety when I went to therapy several years ago but I've felt that there has to be something else since I started feeling different in middle school. I've avoided people responsibilites and have taken jobs where I can mostly avoid interpersonal communication. I do still have close friends a great family and a girlfriend but I still have this urge to selfisolate and be alone. However I do try to help people whenever asked and I try to do well at my workplace. Right now I have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion 13 years along the line in a position that I could basically hold for the rest of my working life. But it would surely involve a lot more responsibilites speaking another language I don't know too well I live in a bilingual country where I speak the minority language a lot more and of course a ton more interpersonal communication. I've searched and applied for other jobs recently because my current contract will expire in a few months. I'm much more inclined to take a temp job for 1 and a half year with something I like more and less interpersonal communication than a potential permanent job position. It probably sounds crazy for most people if they heard this but this is genuinely how I feel. I let my feelings of inadequacy and wanting to avoid people control me instead of doing something that could secure my future. Is this at all relatable?,Personality-disorder
50701,Any advice is greatly appreciated I have AvPD and I am too afraid to ask for help. Even if I found the courage to find a therapist I am a minor so I would also have to tell my parents that just feels impossible. Do you guys have ideas of small steps I could take so I can work my way up to having the courage to get help? I struggle with things like ordering food at restaurants so is there anything easier than that?,Personality-disorder
50702,Finally deactivated Facebook. Where I am from everybody is on Facebook. That anxiety inducing place where I never feel safe and I feel hated invisible and dumb. Lately I've been spiralling and posted sad angsty posts to people who don't care about me. Thankfully I got only 60 friends. Facebook made me feel more alone. I'm disabled and I don't go outside and I struggle with texting. I just don't get it. I don't have the energy. I kept deleting my posts feeling more ashamed. I need it for something that's work related and still ongoing. But enough. I don't care if everyone is there I rather not feel like a burden and vent on Reddit. Having a profile with my name and face while I am utterly depressed? No thanks. It's not like I made any friends there. I really hope that my issues will be resolved and I won't go back and make a fool outta myself because no one cares.,Personality-disorder
50703,I desperately wish want to live alone but physicallyfinancially cant I have always dreamed goal of mine to get away from my family and all people if I worked hard I could live by myself and never ever have any obligation to speak to another human being so long as I had my ducks in a row both financially and in general think ordering groceries and just leave it at the door tip well go away. I'm getting older and I hate how much I keep needing to interact with people I don't have anyone in my life other than my parents but even they are on my last tiny nerves... except we've been needing eachothers help a lot. They're old and need help I'm getting older and sometimes need help when im getting sick or life happens. This flop era is turning into a flop lifetime. I'm drained seeing people. I just want to wake up 1 day in my own place and hear complete and total silence never cross paths with another human being never make eye contact or play the dumb game of social interaction and just have enough... stuff to get my needs met. Not even an escape I just want to exist solely.,Personality-disorder
50704,Do you also feel this way? I just really came across with this term avoidant personality disorder on Google by searching why do I want to be alone and live on my own away from others and I clicked on the very first article that came up. I couldn't give much clearer description of myself after reading the article and so I looked it up on reddit and surprisingly a subreddit exists dedicated to this. I desire to be alone and living on my own away from my family and people because I feel inhibited by them. I feel like I'm restricted and couldn't act my true self when I'm with them maybe because I'm afraid of being disliked by them? I'm not really sure and I'm still learning and knowing about myself. Am I the only one who feels this way?,Personality-disorder
50705,Once people get to know me they tend to love me... They only problem is they never get to know me because the only possible way they will is if I am forced to be in a situation with repeated exposure to them in which case I become familiar and slowly open up over the span of a week or two. It's downright disturbing how many times this has happened in my life and it's depressing to think that those opportunities are few and far between now that I'm out of the primary environment they occur school. I was so desperate at one point that despite having everything people normally strive for great career money success etc. I thought about joining the army just to meet people... Holy shit what is wrong with me.,Personality-disorder
50707,New to the communitydiagnosis Hey allI was just diagnosed with AvPD yesterday along with some other things and to be honest I still feel a little shell shocked. I'm still learning more about the diagnoses obviously but I wanted to ask what tips or lessons the community has for a newbie like me. What do you wish you knew when you were first diagnosed? I've been working on overhauling my brain for a few years and I want to avoid falling into a trap where I just give up before I can fail as it is my tendency to do.,Personality-disorder
50708,Dating apps even harder with AvPD Disclaimer I dislike dating app culture in general. There's a hell of a lot more to a person than a few pictures and prompts.If I'm not attracted to someone then I won't swipe on them. If I am attracted to someone and there's even one thing on their profile that I lack or don't relate to then I won't swipe on them either. If there's someone I'm attracted to and there's nothing problematic in their profile I won't swipe on them because I doubt they'll be interested in me. In the end this leaves a very very small pool of people which I guess makes the whole thing pointless?,Personality-disorder
50709,My friend expressed that she is disappointed in me. Long story short I felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class. I didn't show up for this class in forever and didn't turn in much work so she was worried I'd procrastinate like I did in 1 semester and fail.When I said I'll probably skip again she looked at me with so much disappointment and said I really should stop caring about people that much.It didn't register then but it hits me now how hurt I am from her words. It feels like I'm not doing good enough and I probably am not. So that day I forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. But I can't get the look on her face out of my mind.To be fair to her I said I needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. So maybe she didn't think I felt as horrible as I did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.,Personality-disorder
50710,Feeling down lately It was my birthday the other day and it was a bit depressing. I spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza it was good though lol I didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake also good. I was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my momI dont have many friends besides a few online friends and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me. When I see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry. My friend says everybody cares and loves me but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their livesTo make this worse my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her. The last time i had a therapist who knew of my avpd they screamed at me and said i couldnt be helped...This is all just making me feel hopelessly depressed and feeling rejected ,Personality-disorder

50715,Is freezing during a conversation an AvPD symptom? Hi all! I'm new to this subreddit I was recently diagnosed with AvPD. I'm trying to understand it and come to terms with it.The thing is I don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks I know like my colleagues and friends I'm even morethanaverage social.However I do notice that I'm... slow in social interactions. I mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and I can't answer properly in the moment. Or I can't hear someone properly but I'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves ?! so I just kinda freeze andor act as if I heard what they said and the conversation goes on. Then later I think of a correct reaction and can't for my life understand why I shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then.This happens with friends too although it's more common with folks I'm not that comfortable with. Is this an AvPD thing or just a me thing?TLDR Is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an AvPD thing?,Personality-disorder

I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder afraid to leave the house by myself reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.Nothing really brings me happiness except substances and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and I've been mostly sober for a year.I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70 of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.I don't have many friends and live in a small town so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked I've tried so many treatments but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.And I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help that I don't know if I can find.Please if you can relate at all or have any advice please please respond. lt3 I'm desperate.,Personality-disorder

50720,Inner monologue is brutal One problem I have with criticism and people offering it is that I've heard it already. A lot. From myself. I think the worst things about myself to myself constantly. The other night I told myself that I'm nothing more than potential. The reason I'm lonely is because no one wants to wait around for me to finally decide to be a reality. Im walkingempty promises. That encompasses a lot. So when someone wants to tell me about myself it feels like a rerun. And they hate that. Hate that they can't get their issue off or add their redundant nugget of truth. Idk if that's part of avpd. And its coming off as arrogant. It's not the critiscm itself. I don't mind. More fuel for the fire. It's the attitude that erupts in response to me being unphased. I always feel like I'm preparing myself for the worst possible things so I'm not as affected when they happen. Being one step ahead of anyone trying to hurt me. Sorry if this has been discussed. I'm in and out a lot.,Personality-disorder

50724,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure egodystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are egosyntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? Like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality-disorder
50725,I hate myself so much I met this guy on vacation and we hung out for two days at the pool. I'm a very socially anxious person but with him I felt like I'd known him for years. One night he told other teenagers that he liked me. They told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriend's here. I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. I was bullied at school for being the quiet kid in class and I would run to my parents hoping they'd comfort me. But they'd get mad at me for being so quiet and they'd blame me too. I used to go up to my room at night and sing myself to sleep someday my prince will come. Now he was finally here. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and got mad at our friends for telling me.He cut off contact with with me. I was so sad that the one person who saw me for the good I have to offer still gave it up. They broke up two months later and he looks at my social media. We're not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. Im not angry at him for being loyal. Im angry at him for thrusting me into this situation. Im sure it wasnt easy for him but I was the one that suffered the greatest. He got to choose between two girls. His girlfriend is a victim too but at least he tried to make things okay with her. And me? I had no intention of getting in the way of a relationship. I just thought I finally fell in love.,Personality-disorder
50726,Appearance and AvPD It seems superficial almost but my severe acne is contributing a lot to my avoidant tendencies right now. I'm doing everything in my power to treat it dermatologist prescription acne cream antibiotics clean bedding clean diet daily showers face wash etc. It just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst I've seen. I'm talking big red cysts. At this point I'm convinced my lithium is causing it.I was making decent progress too. I was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. I'm trying to work up to going back to work. But I just can't bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this. If I go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how I look and feeling gross I feel as though I'm doomed to fail. If my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then I pretty much have to bail. I'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. I don't know what to do it just feels hopeless. Between severe cystic acne and hyperhidrosis it is so fucking difficult to put myself into social situations. It's much safer to just hide away and wait it out but each day that passes is another day I've lost.,Personality-disorder

I think oh fuck I said something wrong. I always say something wrong. I can't ever say anything right. I'm such aThen they'll reply. I chide myself for being so silly. Then do the same thing 40 more times within the same conversation. You'd think being proven wrong so many times would fix it but no. I always think Ah this is the time I fucked up.

50729,The worst part is the lack of hope Im always gonna be like this. Even with years of therapy and meds even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing and anxiety reducing drugs Im still too socially anxious and awkward. Sure I can force myself to socialise but I cant force myself to enjoy it or force myself to relax and just be myself. The fact that this shit isnt getting any better no matter what I try is so demoralising it makes everything else pointless having severe avpdsocial anxiety really does infect every little area of your life. I cant hold a job I cant make friends I havent talked to a girl in years never mind having a relationship. My anxiety is so bad I get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen or hearing others use voice chat in video games. And as I said sure I could force myself to get out there and maybe make friends or a gf but I cant force myself to enjoy being around them. Id be constantly stressed out tense unable to relax. Id have nothing in common with them I only ever feel comfortable alone. Living with a brain like this is like torture craving connections and feeling horribly lonely but being unable to actually make any connections or function in a social situation. Im technically an adult but I have no independence I still feel like a child and I know for a fact that if I keep on going my future is nothing but boring bleak and lonely. Whats the point of going to an awful stressful job everyday if my days off are just as bad. My hobbies are just escapism I dont even enjoy anything anymore Im just so tired I really dont see the point in going on when my brain is this fucked up and my future is inevitably empty and alone. Im barely in my 20s but Im certain I wont make it to 30 its so crazy how fucked up i am avpd is so awful it robs you of a basic human need but still leaves you with the desire for it. A longing hunger that can never be sated the empty void inside my only gets bigger things are only getting worse. No heartbreak or feeling of loss nothing to even look back on theres just nothing. There has always been nothing my life is empty and always will be,Personality-disorder
50730,This is a bit of a weird question but does anyone else relate a lot to these anime titles? Mushishi Kino's Journey etc I've always wondered if this is something AvPD adjacent. Mushishi Kino's Journey Spice and wolf Girl's last tour Serial Experiments LainThey are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.Does this make sense?,Personality-disorder
50731,All I am is a useless burden I volunteer at a place that I like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because I like helping people plus Itll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days I didnt show up due to sickness. Now im supposed to text them when I dont show up my manager? boss? made that very clear. She even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that I absolutely couldnt take phone calls due to anxiety. Now I may or may not have just skipped that part as Id hate to bother them with a text plus its embarrassing. So basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that I cant keep not notifying them when I cant go and I have one last chance or shed rather have me not help out at all. This of course I soooo badly wanna say traumatized because it feels that way but ive experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasnt actually traumatic really hurt me. All I wanted to do was help. I just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all I did was end up being a burden. I hate myself for this im scared to even go in again. If I cant even hold a volenteer position im sure as hell arent ever going to be able to get a real job when I get older. I fucking hate this disease its taking my life away.,Personality-disorder
50732,Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I selfdiagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic paranoid insecure and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my trauma is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did but they felt really sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself and nobody did for me.This person lashed out at me calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and honestly that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.This person wasn't wrong but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back it felt nasty and unwarranted.Still though it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends a few years since those bad exchanges occured and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my selfesteem and it still does.When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like I wanna die to myself like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more normal again though.Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered offtopic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.,Personality-disorder

50736,Does anyone find it so hard to get over a commentcriticism to the point they feel suicidal? Trigger warning. Mention of Eating disorders and suicide. A month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned 30. He was saying how he didnt look 30 and he pointed to me and said he looks older than me. Im 24. It felt like a stab in my heart. Ever since Ive barely left the house. I wasnt trying to date before that but now Im not even going to try. I feel suicidal now and I dont feel like lifes worth living. Im old looking for my age so I should just give up. That comment is running through my mind 247. Its torture. I feel so embarrassed. If my brother knew what that comment did to me it would suck. Im so angry but hurts. Its not really his fault how I feel but why did he say that. Ive struggled with eating disorders my whole life. I get anxious seeing my brother because Im scared of what he will say. Everything reminds me of that comment. I have barely been eating. It just reminded me why I shouldnt leave the house because other people will think the same. It feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but its taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday. How am I meant to go through life if a silly comment like that has gotten me like this. How do I get over it? Im not strong enough to go through life.,Personality-disorder

50740,More Clarity Insight amp Awareness An article I wanted to share with you all to read. Thought it might bring more awareness for yall especially for the ones who are unofficially diagnosed and highly suspect they may have it. Although I have enough clarity to know I have it undiagnosed this is hands down the best breakdown and description of each possible symptoms that come with it. Never heard it like this before. It's not like your typical DSM5 avpd symptoms that are more generalized and broad. This is more in depth and even more eye opening since I resonate so much with all of them.

50742,Anyone else lie as a child? Not sure if its an AVPD thing but growing up I told a string of lies to all of my very few friends. It weighs on me almost daily. Some were really horrible like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. Of course thats not real. I cant believe I said those things to people but it felt like the only way at the time.Through a lot of reflection I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person because I didnt deserve them. But nothing in my life that I understood at the time was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if youre not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge its not a valid mental health condition. I didnt think I had any reason to have the problems I did so I had to give people fake reasons to make them believe it because my parents told me thats the only way.Also somewhat of a test like if they stay for this horrible person Im pretending to be theyll surely stick around for who I actually am if thats better. And its not hard to be better than that given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave then Ill have been in control of the rejection. And theyre not reacting to the true me anyway so the judgement doesnt hurt as badly. Avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person.,Personality-disorder
50743,My mom has Avoidant and dependent personality disorder and I don't know what to do. My mom is a very caring and emotional person and she's never been mean or rude in any way. However she never believes me when I say that to her. She's struggling with loving herself and believes that no one loves her and can help her. And because of that she has resorted to drinking. Because of her disorders she constantly bullies herself every day on everything she does and thinks she's the worst person alive. She's very sensitive too so one little thing can ruin her day and cause her to drink. My parents are separated but theyre both on good terms and still talk. On top of that Im struggling with myself too and I think Im stressing her out. I'm only 14 so what can I do to help her? She tried many antidepressants and other treatments but said that none works. Compliments doesnt work either since she never believes me.I always worry she's going to do something bad to herself one day.,Personality-disorder
50744,AvPD diagnosed recently Hey all I was diagnosed with AvPD quite recently and finally I guess after all those years spent in confusion what is wrong with me. I finally got an appointment at psychologist we were doing for the first few hours screening process turned out I do have AvPD and I met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with BPD. Also he mentioned that I do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. But after I read his diagnosis this evening he wrote that I have Other personality disorder. Which idk how I feel about that. Like I do not belong to anything even in this. And when I started to talk to him about feeling really depressed and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today he just said that we will talk about it next time in a two weeks. And I am so confused about this like no one really care especially with the suicidal thoughts. And feeling I do have no one to talk. Or maybe I dont want to? I dont know. But this is making me super super lonely and more depressed. No one really cares..,Personality-disorder

50754,Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD I don't date much and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. Hes a empathetic person that cares for other people but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95 sure he's gone to therapy because even though he will explode at the most random times there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.Before we dated I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly a few weeks before he was flirting with me but I didnt pick up on it. So when I invited him it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter that I dont follow he was saying stuff like playing with peoples feelings is bad and disloyal people annoy me. The next several weeks he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.Hell also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really arent a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll.

50756,Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart and attractive and I care for people but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my first love?The first guy Dave I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side. We only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. The second guy Steve I met a year later at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives. We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wpn90,Personality-disorder

Im the only single person here and theres so many years of bonding and inside jokes Ive missed out on. You know when at the beginning of the night everyone seems happy to see you and laughs at your comments if youre your lucky but then everyone slowly stops replying to you and distancing themselves from you as the night goes on. I also got overstimulated and frustrated very briefly not at anyone in particular but now I just feel like I overstayer my welcome.

And worst of all I have to be honest to heal. Im not even honest with myself. I just smile and nod to everyone. No one takes me seriously because Im always laughing and joking. I cant turn it off. Like when your parents say keep making that face and itll stick that way forever I got my face stuck in a clown mask.I feel like a shriveled dehydrated soul. Like a sewer rat crawling out of the soggy drain. Im horrifically depressed the worst of my life. And honestly the effort just doesnt feel worth it. Id really rather just rot and die.

It is possible! Its just really hard uncomfortable takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? Im also open to suggestions of what else could help.P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry skeptical reaction or think Im being narcissistic.

50772,I look like how I want to. So this is actually something really positive for me even if it isn't considered the best thing in everyone's minds. I was going to the bathroom and I was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days. The pants used to fit me just fine but I've lost so much weight that I have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off. Anyways what I'm getting at is I saw myself in the mirror when I walked in and I couldn't help but think that I look exactly how I want to look. I love how comfy clothes look my hair is long and messy and I guess I'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. I am embarrassed that as a guy I like feeling cute but I think it's great and I've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. But when I was admiring myself in the mirror I lifted up my hoodie no I don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies the temperature much too hot for that as I can barely wear this hoodie and I saw that my waist was super skinny. Of course I don't eat much and I still function fine so I guess that's okay. What I'm getting at is I was able to look at myself in the mirror today and I liked what I saw and people can think what they want I look exactly how I want to look today and I love that.Things have really been getting better for me and though there's still plenty of low points I can easily see my condition is getting better.

Its exhausting but its basically second nature at this point and I literally dont know how to be anything else. I find myself telling so many little lies even about the most mundane things about myself and I dont even mean to do it on purpose. My opinions are always what I think the other person wants to hear. Every word I say and everything I show on the surface is always a watered down version of what I truly want to say and feel. Even when Im just in the car with someone I only play music I think they would like or what I want them to think I listen to. Most of the time I dont even know what parts of myself are true or not. Im like a puzzle made up of completely different pieces that dont fit together. Its all just so fucked. I dont know how to fix this.

I'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. Actually I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. My friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends i.e. other outsiders. We'd meet to play computer games or sometimes rarely go swimming. But we never really talked about personal stuff. I'm not even sure this counts as friendship?Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together?

Sending an email or text takes me way longer than it should.It really interferes when Im trying to talk with others.

Anyway he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.Now my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still havent let go of the past. And the truth is neither have I. Ive forgiven my partner but I havent forgotten how everyone else treated me even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school seek any professional or academic opportunities but mainly it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply dont trust anyone anymore. Today my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents and his friends were already there since theyre in the same class. Keep in mind that I havent seen anyone in about 23 years. After panicking for a week before the event I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself its not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot as well. Well.Aside from my partner everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke they wouldnt acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light so he didnt confront anyone. He did stick by my side so I was at least grateful for that. It all just augmented my social anxiety avoidant personality and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me. Im really struggling to decide if its just a bad day or if Im really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that hes grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes ideally we wouldve never had to go through our dark phase. But hes helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me. They have no idea what their rejection does to me.,Personality-disorder
50784,is it only me? i've been diagnosed having BPD borderline personality disorder 4 years ago when i was 16 since then my life have been a living hell. However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot though i still have all the BPD symptoms some symptoms like avoidance social anxiety isolation feeling less came up from nowhere. For matter of fact i stopped talking to all my friends stopped working going out date i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement and if it wasn't for my mother i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden. Sometimes i think i might be paranoid but i don't think people wan't me any harm nor i feel persecuted i'm just ashamed of myself... I don't know if i have AvPD or just social anxiety but it's a fucking misery..Is there anyone if this situation?,Personality-disorder
50785,does anyone else hide their phone from everyone or turn off the television when someone else walks into the room? Not because they are doing something suspicious but because they don't want their preferences or choices to be seen? I have the option to watch YouTube on a smart TV but instead I watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when I'm in company because I don't want anyone to see my web or streaming history even if it's something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article. I just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although it's generally harmless and boring crap.I remember being 10 years old and my brother being angry at me because I would turn off the TV and act all shifty when he walked into the room.When I was a child I would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because I would be so embarrassed. That was my first sign of AVPD.I was eventually diagnosed at 21 and again by another psychologist at 27.,Personality-disorder
50786,Lack of opinion and interest in things Anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? New show comes out new game comes out new trend im always late to it all. I always find myself saying the phrase thats a thing? when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else hasI seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is I hate it and 10 is I love this and will skip sleep to do it the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I love. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times Im just not that into it as the people around me. One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea but like this happens with everything I tryOr when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just heard was a highly paid major without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking what jobs it would train me for hell whether or not I even liked it. It was just ok sounds good. One of the most important decisions of my life made in 10 minutes. And now senior year I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.Makes me think about how many opportunities Ive missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life. IdkI'm asking on this sub mostly because I'm curious if this is related to avpd or not. Or if its more a personality thing,Personality-disorder
50787,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know but in the platonic sense too.i don't even think i'm physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera.don't get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age i feel like it's too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people.but i think that's okay. somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food.there's some days when loneliness hurts though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.You think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont. In fact you feel more alone than you did before you left But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. Bojack Horseman,Personality-disorder
50788,This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do could have been done better and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now during my clinical rotations every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve. I am always reserved and quiet and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However this has backfired on me as I struggle to form connections and networks losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible which makes me feel hopeless. What can I do to sustain balance at least in my mind? In addition to this I am lonely and the effect on my alreadydamaged mental health is apparent. Last year I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable and I felt liked. But in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable whether I had anything interesting to say and whether they looked down on me. The gutwrenching anxiety became too much to bear and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media I see how new people have joined the group formed close friendships and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this mysterious aura around me but after a few more dates I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.I'm sorry if I went on for too long or sounded negative but I really needed to share my thoughts and emotions with those who can understand. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.,Personality-disorder
50789,AvPD and covid has ruined my dream job. So I've been a nanny for about 10 years now daycare before that and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction. I'd go to work one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say goodnight and that was it. Since covid however at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to say hi to their kid. I worry so much about where they are what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby my appearance the way I dress. I imagine they're mocking the way I sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.I am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder. I can't tell you how many times I've tossed my phone across the room when I hear footsteps coming because even if I am only looking up the weather or craft ideas I'm terrified they'll think I'm on the phone all day.,Personality-disorder
50790,BPD and AvPD comorbidity anyone? Lately Ive been reading more about BPD particularly silent BPD and I check off every symptom on the list. Im wondering if its a common thing for these two conditions to be related as it seems that this combo could be incredibly self destructiveas I am and hectic. Thoughts?,Personality-disorder
50791,is it wrong of me? i am not diagnosed with avpd. i think i have it but i wont say i have it. ive shown a lot of symptoms since childhood. im 18 and usually they diagnose people who are older so yea idk. ive posted on here several times and feel such a comfort with all the people who relate. ive lost friendships because of how i am. its so nice to feel understood and to connect with other people like me. i dont know where else to go to vent so i usually go here. all the people who comment really make me feel better since they get it.,Personality-disorder
50792,How do you get through the process of getting a job? Im planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for. I shouldve started applying for those weeks ago but Ive been avoiding it because I feel like Id either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking Ill be a valuable addition to their institution which I dont think I would be. So essentially Ive been doing self sabotage. Now the problem is that Ive had quite a lot of absences at school the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. Ill need references for the application process I dont have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they dont want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they think they know Ill only mess things up. Honestly I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow would be a miracle in the first place Id somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again. If I dont go for this diploma Ill essentially have wasted four years of my life and I dont think my chronically depressed self could recover from that. Any advice?,Personality-disorder
50793,So tired of everything I am so goddamn tired of everything. I am not looking forward to anything have no goals..just a lowpaid job that I don't really like. I guess I can be proud that I got one in the first place despite how horribly painful that was to get used to it and my thoughts about quitting it after first week. But honestly other than that I have no clue why I am doing all this. I mean everything..going to job eating trying to do something..living. I am so tired I barely drag my body to work or practically anywhere. About my job..I got more or less used to it but I still feel like my coworkers hate me. It's my avpd brain acting up again. Goddamn pesky little thing. They're nice to me but this irrational part of me wins every time Every day is a misery and I am so tired.. I always tell myself that I have to go forward and don't stop but by now I am not sure why or where I am going. Feels like I am just aimlessly wandering around in the darkness with no clue whatsoever,Personality-disorder
50794,Just wonder if people have heard of hypersensitivity. Im a Highly Sensitive Person or HSP but I realized I was being super sensitive for awhile now. I think this is when I started to realize my AvPD. I was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it. Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive. I think a lot of this comes from trauma. Also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general. I dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas. Ive been doing that alot more lately. It took a really long time but I feel less stuck now.,Personality-disorder
50795,Please tell me Im not the only one? When people get to know me Im actually very loud. Almost obnoxiously loud as in Id be embarrassed if I acted that way around random people And I sometimes wonder if Im avoidant because of the fact that deep down Im just an obnoxiously loud person and somehow Ive decided being avoidant keeps my life easier. Less drama no risk of annoying people. But then I also wonder if maybe in reality Im just loud sometimes to make up for the way too many times Ive kept everything inside? Idk but that leads me to another question. How can you truly heal from your problems when it would require getting rid of coping mechanisms held in place all your life?I should add Im generally a very quiet person.,Personality-disorder
50796,Can't make a single phone call? I was told to phone call someone but I cant even make myself! I'm literally about to tell them I'm incapable of talking to people and make myself even more pathetic! Wtf should I do? They will just tell me meaningless things for an hour which I have no solution to.My phobia is getting worse and worse !I'm also starting to have some anger outbursts which rarely happen but I think I will snap! And it is not even that big of deal.,Personality-disorder
50797,What are you guys good at? Sometimes I forget I'm good at things it helps me to remember what ones since there's so much I feel like I'm not good at. I'm more than what I'm not naturally good at.I'm Very naturally flexible so yoga is easy for me. Extremely resourceful I feel like I can make anything out of anything. Great at literary analysis. A good cook. I don't easily give up when something is difficult. Good at understanding amp applying new concepts easily. Good at drawing amp art. Good at trying new things if they're not too overwhelming. Empathetic and nonjudgmental despite what my face and energy are giving off lol Good taste in books fashion films etc. Good at giftgivingWhat about you all? ,Personality-disorder
50798,Anyone here try making online friends? For me its difficult because everyone is more advanced than me or younger. Many people are focused on careersproductivityschoolfamily. I always feel like a kid compared to others when I observe or interact with people.Another issue that would happen is the few people I found remotely on my level would ditch me after some months. I think it does not work with people if you do not objectively help the person or intend to interact with them on a physical or visceral level rather than just talking about interests or random stuff.In theory I should just go ask people if they want to play certain games but it does not feel right if people just opening up about their personal lives or bantering with me makes me feel like trash. It is absurd to me that I have to shut out 99.X percent of the population because they are better than me or I don't share their interests.,Personality-disorder
50799,does anyone else keep making new Reddit accounts? I find myself abandoning Reddit accounts and making new ones every few weeks or so. I hate the fact that Reddit leaves a trail of evidence about me that I can't hide from people and make my comments and questions private. I hate the whole karma and upvotesdownvotes thing. I like Reddit for the simple fact that there are communities here for just about everything that I don't have access to otherwise. I also use Facebook groups but I have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile. If I have commented too much in a single group and people start recognizing me I usually change my name on Facebook. You are usually allowed to change your name on Facebook several times a year or so.I just hate the fact that I am seen and I have built a persona either online or offline. I just wish I could be invisible or anonymous everywhere I went including online. I also hate people knowing what country I was born in because most people are from the United states and it makes me stand out so I try and use American terms and spellings as much as I can. I also have trauma from my home country and just mentioning that I am from there makes me anxious and I feel paranoid talking to people from my own country. I go back and edit comments constantly and I'm always deleting things.People automatically find this behavior shifty and I have been called out a few times and people always think I'm up to something.,Personality-disorder
50800,Is anybody mainly scared of simply being perceived? Like I dont really care if they think Im dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying. Eye contact is the absolute worst because its 100 percent focus. I always try to look people in the eyes but HAVE to look away within a second otherwise I feel like theyll hate me. Im 24M and its waaaay worse with women I feel like Im invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point I dont even know what their face looks like after an interaction.When my best friend of 10 years comes over to watch a movie I will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch. But I can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all. I also feel like I have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if I go to a restaurant I will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time. I just realized being blind would be kinda awesome and probably take away like 90 percent of my stressors. Okay this got way out of hand im baked goodnight and if youre reading this I love you,Personality-disorder
50801,Im worried Im second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me and he asked them not to tell me but they did. When he found out that I knew he cut off all contact with me. Two months later he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it I'd just watch the videos.A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers but whenever I'd watch his videos a few hours later my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days eg. I'd watch his videos one day watch it two days later then the day after and each time I saw them my views went up and on the days that I didn't watch them they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year it was still frequent but less so. Now it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time he even posted a TikTok in English English isn't his first language and all of his previous videos were in his native language.TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.However twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up he started following her on TikTok but unfollowed her within a few hours probably because she didnt follow him back. A month later one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I dont post much and he looks at it every two to three days.,Personality-disorder
50802,You're actually all great people and this subreddit is living proof. I've been on this subreddit for a good period of time now and it's quite an active one with several posts every day and pretty much all of them receive a response of some sort whether it's about people asking for advice or venting. There's no toxicity. There's no arguing. There's just empathy and help. So I just want to say that although living with AvPD can be a painful existence that eats away at our selfesteem I appreciate all of you for making this subreddit such a great space.,Personality-disorder
50803,I make people uncomfortable My presence makes others uncomfortable and i can feel it. There's this awkwardness. Whenever I need to go out and i have to interact with others or when I'm with my own family i feel it. And i know that awkwardness is because of me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I know some will say it's in your head but no i really feel like my presence is just uncomfortable to be around. You know sometimes people can sense things? People can sense when you're sad or in my case uncomfortable in social interactions so they pick up on that and they aren't used to that so then everything becomes uncomfortable. I don't like this feeling.,Personality-disorder
50804,Conversational and social skills what are they I think Ive never given myself a chance to develop them because of AvPD. I couldve had a fuller social life in school but I was so in my shell I just had a few close friends. And even with them I felt I couldve been better. It seemed like they all clicked with each other very well and even though we were all good friends sometimes there was something missing in my connection with people. I know they say skills are to be learned but it really really REALLY seems like its just inborn for other people. So I just do everything I can to avoid one on one conversations so nobody has the chance to think Im weird and dont know how to talk or something.,Personality-disorder
50806,I cant sustain long conversations It doesnt matter who the other person is if we are engaged in a conversation the longer it takes the more symptoms I get. At first I am ok then the worry begins in my head where at the same time I am talking I start observing myself. The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear my ears turn red my lips start to shake my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. Later on as days pass I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. After sometime I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. I am 56 and have been like that since High School. Some medications have helped particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes. This is all from times in my childhood where I was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts uncles grandparents and teachers. One of my grandmas used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when I did something bad. So for some reason now when I talk to other adults it triggers all of the reactions I had as a child when I was getting yelled at.,Personality-disorder
50807,Feeling disconnected from peers how do I stand out to fit in? Hi I've been struggling a lot in school from even before college and lonely for most of my life. I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising I can't seem to use social media well too afraid that my relatives will find it andor hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange? I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long I want to express myself and find a space for my art craft and ideas that accepts me for me.And I'm sure in order to be independent I need to also be comfortable with myself.But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down. I feel like a NPC living a scripted life.How do we overcome this and have the courage to live for us? Can I do it in a way to eliminate these stresses? Or is avoiding them the main issue?,Personality-disorder
50808,I love the idea of a romantic relationship but I cant put the work in. I 28M feel like any kind of datingrelationships is just work work work work work work. I like the idea of having a connection in my life but I dont think Im willing to do what it takes.I think bc Im so lowmaintenance I attract a lot of very clingy needy people which made me hate the idea of dating because theyd never leave me alone. And not just the process of dating itself which sucks for most people but just being in a relationship requires too much work and expectations. Maybe Im just lazy but how do you have the motivation to keep going with dating when its just annoyance?,Personality-disorder
50809,crippling guilt from my inability to answer texts I dont know how common this is but its extremely difficult for me to find the strength in me to text people back and its killing my nonexistent social life and the possibility of ever finding love. I live in constant guiltdread knowing that I have people in my DMs trying to contact me to hang out but my fear of embarrassment and awkwardness is freaking killing me. All ive ever wanted was to belong and be able to make friends but my brain literally stops me in my tracks. Its also necessary to note that I have ADHD primarily inattentive and once I take my medication Im lucky to have maybe 30min of adequate dopamine levels to push myself and reply. Sometimes I do reply but when I go back to baseline I just want to isolate and be in my dark room. I really feel like Im being tortured by my own brain. Its a terrible feeling to crave social interaction but to also be deathly afraid of the possibility that I could ruin everything and be viewed as an embarrassment. I really dont feel worthy of having the opportunity to make friends. My SSRIs have made me so numb and my personality rarely sparkles anymore so I cant imagine anyone would want to be around someone so dull.Do any of you relate?? It feels like a mental trap.,Personality-disorder
50810,Currently grieving the life Ill never have Yes Im working on myself and its never to late to startchange. But some things are time sensitive and Ill just have to accept Ill never have children for example. Sure I could pop one out right now but that wouldnt be the responsible thing to do given my mental state as well as just my general state of things.There just isnt enough time for me to get well enough get my life in order find a reasonable partner get married and start a family before time runs out. So now Im just trying to prepare myself for when the inevitable comes and Im still here left alone probably still struggling mentally.That is all Im sad this disorder has robbed me of so much and I still cant seem to get a handle on it.,Personality-disorder
50811,is there a point in trying to completely get over this shit i try so hard to get close to people and basically no ones ever responsive and literally no one gives more than baseline politeness. i expend so much energy trying and nothing comes of it. all i get is hurt because people dont care about me at all. it hurts so much to try and get nothing and rejection in return.I'm genuinely wondering if there's really any point in me continuing to try when nothing works out and i just end up in so much pain. i want to just give up and isolate to save energy and prevent this fucking god awful pain i keep feeling over and over again every time something social comes upi understand part of this hopeless feeling is my unrelenting depression but ive quite literally never been able to develop true close relationships outside fucking elementary school and im 21 now,Personality-disorder
50812,just turned to my coworker and talked one day i've always been in awe of people who can just start talking. every time i think 'i could say this!' it's immediately dogpiled with other thoughts. the self hating ones. i don't have it in me to list them right now but if you're reading this unfortunately you probably know what i mean. anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday and i got my marlboros out of my locker. smoking is bad i know. i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy. so i turned to my coworker notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew and said hey check these out. and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries but not here USA. i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since especially not while 100 sober. it was nothing. and the self hating thoughts came right after. but once those settled a bit it was nice. thanks so much for reading i just wanted to ramble as always.,Personality-disorder

Thing is i have avoided everything all my life even my feelings. So its hard.One thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at 13 years old i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality. I only came out once i was 19. So 6 years i was 'locked' in avoiding being who i am. I am in my 30s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out.Is it possible that being ' in the closet' for more then 6 years contribute in developing AVPD? As i notice i still dont accept my sexuality 100 and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality. Thats what i did when i first figured out i was gay thinking that my then friends would bully or reject me...Any other gay people here who can relate?,Personality-disorder
50815,I just need to vent about my partner. I think my partner has bpd maybe AvPDHi everyone. I have no idea how to start this. Im honestly not even sure if bpd or AvPD is correct Im just grasping at straws at this point. My 27f boyfriend 28ms brother has been diagnosed with bpd. Which is why this is my first step. And while Im obviously not looking for someone to diagnose him like this Im just lost. And need someone to listen. I am massively struggling in my relationship and I just need someone to listen. Even if this goes nowhere. My boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if I were to ask the same in return. We just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and I cant quite think of an example of that at the moment he does ask for things in one moment and when I do them or stick to it he tells me its wrong. Example he has wanted to get a photo ID for a while. We have two options drivers licence or a photo card. About a month or probably two ago he said he needed photo ID for a test at work hed been putting off. Then he said not long ago that we dont motivate each other to do the things we need to. I know he has anxiety planning things and doesnt want to so for our anniversary I said pick which ID you want Ill drive you there pay for it and itll be done. Ill put all the planning into it. All good and he loved that idea. The day we were supposed to go he was angry about something and it caused an argument. So we didnt go. Which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. To today. Each week he said Ill do it next week on my day off so I asked and he pushed it again. Today we spoke about it and while hes not good at planning I was waiting around to find out if we were going or not as I wanted to plan when I was done work and went to get gas and groceries. When it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test I told him that I didnt care if we went but if he wanted to study more now was the time. He told me tonight that he only did it so ID shut up about it and when I said you told me you wanted more motivation so I gave it to you he just said fair. But we always have those moments where he says he wants something and I change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. If I try and talk to him about my needs or what Im wanting more of or how Im hurt by something he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. Or hell just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what I was even talking about. If we have an argument for 1 full hour lets say. There will be lulls in the argument. Maybe every 15 minutes. Maybe start half hour mark and then end. It always changes but the lull is when he sits listens and answers me with respect. The other times its that I have said even one word to set him off and hes miserable. And angry and not nice. Im finding myself constantly working around his moods. Sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a TikTok or something I find interesting. If he agrees with what Im showing him all is good. If he doesnt he gets angry. Says hes confused and basically shuts down. Tells me he thinks thats dumb or why would someone even do that. Theyre not part of my life. Why do I even need to listen to that. If Im talking about my work or just complaining hell tell me why he doesnt want to hear it. That its not part of his world so it doesnt matter. Ive asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever I do hell tell me something he needs in return. He cant just take blame for things. Sometimes he can. But normally cant. I definitely do not help the situation because I am at his every beck and call and hes at none of mine. If he asks to be left alone and I walk to another room he says he feels guilty that Im going away. And that hell just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesnt get his way anyway. He wants to be left alone a lot. Cant ever take anything I say and listen. Always has to tell me why whatever Im going through is something hed love to have or how his life is worse. Example we moved for his work. Away from my family and friends and my best friend dropped me. While she was being shitty all the time she was the last person I had to talk to. And if Im sad about it he tells me thats his dream for people to leave him alone and he doesnt understand why Im upset. If something small happens he wildly blows it out of proportion. Especially if its something he doesnt understand. I have to be careful with how I joke with him because he will take everything to heart but has zero problem disrespecting me or poking fun at me for something. If we go out at all he doesnt want to be there and will usually get extremely high or drunk to avoid socializing because it makes him anxious. Im just not sure if this is like anything anyone has dealt with and Im looking for advice or help or just something. Thank you for reading this long novel. I really appreciate you all.,Personality-disorder
50816,I dont know if I actually have AvPD Last few months I was struggeling with lots of depression. So I started looking on internet and I found lots of mental illnesses and I really felt like this one is really matching my symptoms.Now when I somehow improved my depression I see myself differently and I feel differently. I had depression my whole life without even realizing it for me having depression was a normal state sme I had no idea that there is a nondepression state.But now when my depression improved I see that some of AvPD symptoms starting disappearing and I feel better.But at this point I am just not sure I might have it and depression was making it worse. And I might now have it and it was just depression all the time.,Personality-disorder
50817,Mentally Exhausted I have been very mentally exhausted.I dont mind working long hours at my job its just at my job theres a lot of people around since its a large store connected to a bunch of departments. A few months since I graduated high school Ive been working. But I cant seem to really talk to people. I have a tendency to avoid the groups sometimes I cant even open my mouth. Its even worse when I think about how much I suck and how awful I look. I feel like an inconvenience and a burden because plainly I am pretty stupid. Even though at the beginning of my job I was putting on a smile and a happy voice to convince myself it was okay I cant even get myself to smile or look people in the eyes unless I have to. I am so exhausted. I dont know whats wrong with me. I am depressed both mentally and physically tired. I really have no plans for my future.,Personality-disorder
50818,Feeling like I don't do enough I'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not if it's imposter syndrome if it's from old Christian mantras of put others before yourself being baked into my psyche since childhood or if it's a combination of all three but I often feel like I don't do enough for other people in my life. Whether it's with other family members close friends or coworkers I often get this sense. I work from home. And I've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. But now that we're sitting near the finish line almost ready to golive with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover I can't help but feel some kind of guilt like I'm not doing enough. Even though I helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. With friends or family it often comes in the form of should I be there? or I know I be there be present but I really don't want to and then I just feel like a POS terrible friendsiblingsonetc. for not doing it. For example a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. Naturally I didn't go. I'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. Nonetheless I still felt like an asshole for skipping. Especially later when I talked to my dad and asked how it went I asked who was there? and he said Just about everyone. Except for you. I don't think he intended to make me feel guilty but it kind of did. My mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it but nonetheless I felt like I didn't do enough. Even though again this relative having the child and I don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. Another example is a friend a close friend who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. They'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants and 9 times out of 10 I don't go. Part of me appreciates the hell out of that because I need it and it's nice to be includedwanted. Another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone because I don't think I'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. Then I start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. Wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder or if it's something else. Anyone else experience this?,Personality-disorder

50820,Devastated after finding out my little sister has a secret boyfriend Not sure if this belongs here but I'm so upset about this that I haven't slept all night. My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts interests and even my mental health struggles. I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything. Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities. I knew this day would come my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone abandoned and betrayed. She never mentioned that guy to me and my father I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything. Of course I want her to be happy but now all I'm left to do is wait for her to get married move to a different country and forget about me leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone.,Personality-disorder
50821,Does AvPD have another name in your language? In English there's both avoidant and anxious whereas in German there's ngstlichvermeidende anxiousavoidant and selbstunsichere self insecure. The latter got me wondering if there are other names for it across the world.,Personality-disorder
50822,Did not even want to say hi to me I have an online friend and they really wanted me to meet their friend. I was hesitant but they told me that theyre nice so I joined their little discord server literally had like 5 people total with me with the intentions of maybe sending a message or two and never again. But their friend didnt even want to say hi to me. Like my friend told him to say hi and he literally just said no . This happened a few days ago and Im like really upset about it. He barely even knows anything about me.I talked to my friend today and they said that they think he is just jealous that im sort of close with them. But Im still really really hurt and upset about.

50827,HopelessnessToo lateness Is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything? Too late to try too late to get treatment too late for anything and everything? Too old? Or if someone is too badly off? I've seen some people around Reddit and the net refer to failed lives. I've recently made posts and tried to look around Reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be nobody. And the only conclusion I can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up. And AvPD along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess. Growing up or developing AvPD in a family full of NPD didn't help.Most subs seem to skew younger which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive. How has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness? Feeling too old and that it's too late to change anything satisfactorily? Does anyone have other issuesdiagnoses that mix with AvPD to just make things impossible?,Personality-disorder
50828,Quality over quantity Friendships I know people with AvPD struggle to maintain friendships and I do too. For me I think it's the daily or at least frequent messaging to stay in touch that I struggle with. I will get tired and ignore messages just because I don't have the capacity to engage with a subject that I frankly probably don't care much about or I'm just worn out by the constant interaction. The messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me. if it's a friend that lived far away then I'd rather not speak for 6 months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and fortunately I do have a couple that are like that. Anyone relate?,Personality-disorder
50830,Longtime lurker with AvPD just wanting to vent about the fantasy of disappearing and starting a different life Using my alt throwaway because reasons. Recently Ive been having a hard time and although I have deeply caring and wonderful people in my life I still isolate and as much as I crave time with others I get tired so easily after a short while. Also grew up with cluster B parents and family which doomed me to some kind of mental problems. Lately Ive begun to think about the idea of just leaving. Disappearing no trace. Not suicide. Im not suicidal at all I mean leaving going somewhere Im not known changing all my details and completely starting over. I cant help but feel it would make no difference to anyone in fact it might even be better.Ive googled step by step how tos on it.Im hoping to be able to talk to others who have been in this dark of a place and what got you through or any advice.Because this is mostly just a fantasy but the idea is sticking in my head more than Id like it to. I dont actually want to go through with it. I think Edit for clarity what got you through the mental state if youve felt this way not advice on disappearing. Oops!,Personality-disorder

50832,I came off as an asshole today and Im struggling with it I went to the mall to buy some fragrances and I came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers. There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women and theyre all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions I wasnt prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didnt wear anything currently then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didnt really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.This experience made me realize that I also act cold and assholeish to everyone thats not the people I live with or my mom. But thats also the only way I can speak to people so Im kind of stuck between dont socialize at all or act cold to everyone.,Personality-disorder
50833,what avoidance feels like to me i'm not diagnosed but i always thought there was something deeply wrong with me. i've never kept a friend longer than a couple years. i'm in my second year of college and i have been at zero since covid happened. i've transferred schools so new place and new people and i'm more isolated than before.it feels like i'm not human because i'm unable to do the human thing and communicate. like i'm watching and observing but as an alien or a void or something that looks human but if you look to closely its all distorted. or robotic even. someone's failed attempt at a human being.all i do is lay in bed and ruminate over every bad interaction with past friends and family or think about how my roommates or classmates perceive me. fake conversations justifying my actions to absolutely no one. it feels like i'm going insane. i thought it was just social anxiety but i don't get panic attacks. and my reluctance and inability feels wired directly into my veins every fiber of my being and it feels like it can't be undone. like my entire identity is wrapped up in being alone. and that's all i'll ever be.,Personality-disorder
50834,as to not be a burden i will now isolate myself. you are welcome! recently I've been distancing from my friend because I needed some space. but after a while I noticed they seem... happier without me. like actually laughing and smiling more they even started talking to a very cool person. and they even talk to other ppl in the group more often. so now I'm kinda isolating myself because well... i just want them to be happy. if being absent from their life is what will make them happier ill do that. seems like I'm just a toxic person that drains everyone around them.,Personality-disorder

50837,How to cope with shame Hello I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame shame of what I did in a specific moment shame of how I reacted what I've said shame on how I was dressed the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things because anything material has more value than me . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things. ampx200BHow do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life? When I remember one time I start remembering the others they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence that they already happened that there is no way I could live with those things that happened. I feel shame from myself all the time but when those memories come to me I want to snap out of existence. I don't know how to deal with that. Thank you.,Personality-disorder
50838,its becoming impossible to keep avoiding my life without real consequences well real consequences already happened and i avoided facing the feelings that wouldve prevented them from happening but now my parents are threatening putting me in a halfway home or making me live with them again them saying they would sell the house which utterly terrifies me but in the face of how my life has gone suicide is also a considerable option tho not one i can follow through on but its becoming easier to every day its amazing how the economy and life can utterly ruin people isnt it why is it so hard for me to speak in my own voice oh right the trauma its really hard to drag them out of it as their minds resemble mine far too much and mine resembles theirs far too much the pain of having to get a job while also not even being able to be myself in real life is really depressing i feel like just another person with unfulfilled dreams forced to grow up and accept reality,Personality-disorder
50839,Is there anyone else here who checks off all of the boxes for AvPD but cant ever get officially diagnosed with it because your case just isnt bad enough? Im fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that Ive been able to match up to down to a tee. Ive went to therapy and discussed my issues but it doesnt seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.While Im fairly certain I have avpd my case is more mild because it doesnt completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young Ive always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didnt have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that Ive been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. Its a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I cant get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?,Personality-disorder
50840,AvPD can be avoiding woman only? I wonder if avoiding woman can be AvPD? I have avoided woman almost my whole life at some point in high school I liked a girl I talked to a bit. But never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way. Its probably the only time I spoke with a girl. Mainly because I was invested in wanting to be with he but was to afraid to be with her in a relationship.If AvPD is not only avoiding woman for my instance then I dont understand AvPD.,Personality-disorder
50841,I haven't been diagnosed yet I haven't been diagnosed with AvPD but I think I may have this disorder. I was always an anxious child then in my teens I started taking panic attacks before any social situation but mainly before going to school so I stopped going to school I just avoided it. I'm now nearly 30 and I've never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance. I feel like I now avoid anything that causes me the tiniest bit of stress by not leaving my house sleeping and not letting anyone know about it. I then get really depressed and disappointed in my self. It just feels like an endless cycle of me not showing and getting down about. I'm just wondering how AvPD affects others and if there is anyone from the UK suffering from AvPD Thanks,Personality-disorder

50843,I despise my mom 22m Pretty much the title I just can't stand her I never liked her ever since I was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it.Just to clarify I don't think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if it's just the order of the way I put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are MY things she isn't satisfied with the way I put my clothes in my wardrobe or when I don't do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy In the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open even this days she complain when I don't leave a gap but on that case I don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kidspeople' because I don't act or do things they do and I cant forget her 'what you gonna do with your life play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason.Im afraid of embarrassing myself in public im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because I don't think I can do it or I'll make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how I was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons I eat in my room is because I just don't want to be around her because I will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it and my dad lives abroad my ears my hair my clothes everything. She always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever I want regardless of her opinionpicks I still remember that when I was younger she would be upset and mad if I didn't wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as I said I still wear what I wear and the judgement doesn't stop at that. Her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about the way I behave WhY YoU ARe NoT SmiLing and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. She would always try to buy me stuff I don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something.When I think about all of this and other stuff I understand why im so incompetent afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. It's not all her there are things I probably could've done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now I need to find a way to get back on track somehow.Also today I pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings I stored inside. I don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling.P.S if there was another post made by me that's titled the same blame my stupid phone for this XD.

People on social media always say Im trying to get attention but wtf is wrong with that? I dont know for sure if I have avpd but I think I do I cant pay for therapy I live with my mom and I hate her Im 18 cant drive alone I always get in crashes or get a ticket sometimes I speed because Im mad at my uncle. I have a job but I dropped out of school because I dont care and I have so much trauma from everything in my childhood. And anyway nothing matters now except being famous thats all I want I just have no idea why in real life I avoid people but online I have a girlfriend and Im obsessed with her it scares me sometimes because I cant stop thinking about her and if she broke up with me I dont think I could take it Ive only met her once in real life but it doesnt matter I talk to her all the time but the most important thing is that she talks to me and shes obsessed with me so I need her. I think I deserve to be famous more than anyone else because Ive been through so much and also I feel like Im better than most people something about me is different and Im special . Can someone dm me to talk more about this? I need to know why I want to be famous and how can I get famous? Also is it possible to have avpd and want to be famous?,Personality-disorder
50846,Societal Standards Not sure if this is just me but the more I self reflect the more i realize that im unhealthily antisocial but ok with that until i feel societal pressure to be different. Ive always been a loner and i can be like that ALL the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who arent like that and find it weird. Its almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because thats what you need for a happy life apparently but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure theres literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess Im deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and cant relate to others and feel insecure about it like I wish I could be in the standard of whats normal but Im also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy its hard to put into words how I feel but its like Im so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people dont live their lives like that. I dont want to miss out but find it hard to change. I guess my behavior isnt normal but trying to fit in just makes my anxiety so bad. Hopefully somebody understands what I mean. I think this is just how it is when your mentality ill for a long period of time.,Personality-disorder

50848,Conversations Anybody else feel like they dont have the natural ability to have good conversations?Whenever Im having a conversation with strangers Im often pretty quiet and I dont know what to say unless its work related or something Im really familiar with. I think this is normal with society anxiety thoughBut whenever I have conversations with a group of people Im comfortable with like my family I feel like I suck at having conversations. If its about a topic I dont care about I always zone out or stare at out the window. If its about a topic Im interested in its so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn I can wait but it stresses me out and its hard to jump in sometimes. It feels like Im going to forget what I was going to say or theyll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk I feel like people dont really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations sometimes its just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background. Anybody relate,Personality-disorder

50851,How to not hurt peoples feelings I think Im doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally dont interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I cant always have a recovery. When Im socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof disinterested monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them Im just worn out.Usually with strangers it doesnt matter that much because Ill never meet them again but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc. and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying but Im just really irritated right now for reasons other than you and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and theres no reason you wouldve known this Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I cant manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because I at least want to preserve their feelings. My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me do you hate me am I annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent its a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about. I cant handle navigating those questions when Im socially overstimulated but I dont want to make her insecure worse either. I know a relationship is a two way street but I always feel like a burden for my emotions and needs Any advice?,Personality-disorder
50852,Do you have goals? I realised that I never really had or was aware of life goals or dreams I had. I think this is why I don't really feel like a person and so different from others. And why I never let anyone get close to me otherwise they would realise how different I am and distance themselves.Do you have dreams and goals? Have you ever had them maybe as kids?,Personality-disorder
50853,I feel like Ive missed out on my teenage years Its so depressing to think people have spent all these years going out with their friends and partying whilst I was just on my own in my room. Ive always had barely any friends and never been in a relationship or had a paid job I only managed to start doing a few hours a week voluntary work a few months ago. I watch the people around me do exciting things and make new friends and get partners whilst Im just here bored alone and depressed as usual. It doesnt help that later this year Ill move away from this town for university and Ill probably never see most of the people Ive spent years wanting to be friends or more with but been too scared to talk to again. It feels like this phase of my life is really slipping through my fingers and I have no time to repair it. I try to tell myself at least I have the future where I could become better and make the next phases of my life better than this one but in reality I know that Ive just been declining for years so I doubt that very much.,Personality-disorder
50854,did a bunch of dxm yesterday and I realized that the reason I'm like this is that I've viewed other people as threats my whole life. Ever since I was little I've implicitly assumed that other people want to hurt me until and unless I have incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. I have no idea why I'm like this. It sounds like something someone who was abused would write but I wasn't. My parents were nice and caring. I just came out wrong somehow lmao. I had nothing to be afraid of and yet I was terrified of everything ,Personality-disorder
50855,I went to the gym!! I just thought I would share a good thing. I have been trying to go to the gym for a while. I would drive to the parking lot then turn around and go home. Today I went in and walked on the treadmill! I feel so happy about it. Especially after I got the courage to go to church a few weeks ago after missing 3 years and saw someone very triggering and had a melt down for the rest of the day. It made me feel there might be no point in doing things if it is just going to lead to feeling sad and stressed.,Personality-disorder
50856,I went to a party! I actually went to a garden party! There were tiny sandwiches a bunch of fruit and little cracker plates with meats and cheeses. I actually felt comfortable the whole time!I've been on some medicine these past few weeks I can't remember the name and I think they may actually be working. I still get depressed andor anxious around the night time or when I'm not doing something. I just have to keep myself busy and I'll be okay.But about the party. I knew almost everyone there I've known them for a long time now and they're closer to me than my family. I helped set up the party so I didn't feel like I wasn't being useful I took my time this morning in making sure I looked presentable and of course I showed up early just in case. The party lasted about an hour and a half and I even got to talk with some of the people there! Today is just a great day so far and not if but when things start to go back down to normal I hope I don't forget that I was able to be happy today. I know progress can jump forward just as much as it falls back but I'm going to celebrate today as progress!,Personality-disorder
50857,don't be like me little rant I was a college freshman at the beginning of covid. I was just your stereotypical introverted quiet guy who also struggled in social situations. Covid gave me THE perfect excuse to avoid anything stressful. Don't have to go to class don't have to meet anybody everyday I just drowned myself in entertainment. Eventually I dropped out of class and basically became a shut in.Fast forward to a couple years later. I have no idea how time went by so fast. Everyone is all grown up and busy people keep asking about how I'm doing at school and everytime I lie to my parents that yeah I'm going to school I did good on my exams I'm about to graduate etc. It's so fucking unfair to my parents that I turned out to be such a piece of shit. I hate what I've become just lies and avoidance. When I'm actually motivated to do something I'm then immediately reminded by the reality that no matter what I do I still wasted all these years of my adulthood that I'm still betraying my parents' expectations that nothing I do is going to undo all the damage I did to myself. I'm a mess. I have no hobbies I can share with normal people I have no humor because I don't have any experience in the real world I can't make my family happy because I don't even like myself and it shows. Sorry for the rant sometimes you take a step back and really look at the situation you put yourself in and it's unbearable. Why didn't I try harder at school? Why didn't I tell my parents the truth? Facing all these fears I chose the easy way. And it is clearly the wrong choice otherwise I wouldn't be suffering this much now. If you're reading this I hope you can learn not to be like me. Avoidance is hell.,Personality-disorder

Now the one who lives 15 hours away is coming for a few weeks in the summer and she wants to drive to see the one who lives a little over five hours away. He only has the day to visit.

50859,Nobody Knows It But Me Like a clown I put on a show The pain is real even if nobody knows Now I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me The lyrics from the song Nobody knows by Tony Rich Project has always really stuck with me. It illustrated perfectly how Id felt for such a long time. It hit me like a load of bricks how beautifully it described that feeling. A feeling that Id struggled so much to put into words was put so simply and it brings tears to my eyes even now. How sad it is that only You would know this feeling and nobody could relate. It's a tragic love song actually but some lines of the song just resonate with me as someone with AVP.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vPf0BA5IA9Ihttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vPf0BA5IA9I,Personality-disorder
50860,Looking inside I am an avoidant diagnosed 30. I got high and looked inside my reality of my concept of self I wrote down what i actually am inside. Felt like tearing into the layers of characters I built over the base of immaturity or even aware of a concept of such. Felt like a young boy with undiagnosed issues of maturity. Like a man child ugly and unresolved petty character. Outwardly pretending to grown but inwardly hardly even close to a understanding the concept of growthThe gap is hugely unfilled between my physical age and the inner development. The concept of even self feels unexplainedI have some yong age attachment issues that are manifested in my personality. My interaction with people is so shallow with no depth not in a negative outlook but that of a unprocessed thought of selfI am hardly maintaining to keep a distorted adult character on my face I have not understood anything of heartfelt feel good emotions as I haven't even dwelled on it and just brush it off rather to even process as mature person. I just didn't realise that I have actually bypassed all this ages without feeling anything natural maturity that one goes through.,Personality-disorder
50861,I wish I never existed I feel like my whole existence is a failure.I want to connect but I cant. Ive always been way too boring for others. Its been a bit hard lately.The only people I ever really connected with are people that are supposed to be authority figures therapist and a teacher. So they kind of have to put up with me. I mean mytherapist gets paid to talk to people. Besides that he probably has hundreds of other clients. Hell probably be glad if I left one less complicated issue to take care of. If I left he and no one else would remember me anyways. But I honestly dont want to be forgotten. It hurts.Ive never spent time with people in my childhood. I was the weird gay kid the f word. The one that gets picked last in PE class and has always been shorter and weaker than other guys. We once visited my cousins when I was very young. My father got along so much better with my cousins who are all more boyish than I was. I was quiet and boring. My mother told me her dreamwas to be a grandmother. Why else would anyone want a child? She definitely didnt win in the lottery because Im as gay as they come. I almost never spend time with my family I was too young to remember my actual first holiday. It has always been just myroom and I. How am I not supposed to be hurt that the only people I enjoy talking to are people I will never spend time with outside of their job? It feels so unfair. I wish I could end it all sometimes but I dont want anyone to find my corpse probably traumatizing them. Once again Im probably only doing this because deep down I want pity. But this is my only emotional outlet right now.,Personality-disorder
50863,Where to stay during summer holidays? 12 months Europe I'm looking for some ideas or thoughts every holiday since childhood I'm 26 now I spent in my hometown living with my parents who used to be pretty abusive. Despite them now trying to do better I still think it's not healthy for me to be there for 3 months straight but idk what to do. I got no friends or relationship duh and I only finished highschool. I don't mind strangers seeing me too much I mainly struggle with seeing someone regularly. I got few thousands saved since I never used to spend money on anything. I'm not thinking about travelling rather renting something in nature and staying in one place for a month or two. I was thinking maybe look for an animal shelter job in my country but I doubt they'll hire me for a month on the other hand I'm afraid I'll be completely bored.

50865,Has anyone figured out how to detach from wanting love? Im tired of wanting love. I get the courage to ask a girl out only to get shot down. I can kind of talk up people one on one but in groups I freeze.When youre in a relationship you have to form relationships with their friends and family. But that seem nearly impossible.Has anyone figured out how to happily detach? The only relationships I can seem to find are with women with BPD. This always leads me to ruining my life and taking 5 years to start over.,Personality-disorder
50866,Don't know how much longer I can take the loneliness I haven't had a bf or been intimate with a guy in 10 years. I can't fend off the feeling of desperate loneliness anymore. I've been trying Tinder for the 2nd time used it for a brief period last year but never really talked to anyone before uninstalling and have been forcing myself to put in an effort responding to messages and messaging first. But it hasn't been going well...there were a few guys who I thought I was hitting it off with but they all stopped responding to me eventually. The last one hurt the most because I had gathered up the courage to ask him to meet me. I don't know what I did wrong I thought things were going ok we had been chatting regularly for a little more than a week. I messaged him again this morning to let him know I was available today if he wanted to see me and he still didn't get back to me and probably never will.I'm devastated right now. I was so happy about talking with this guy a few days ago and now I'm back to being as lonely as ever. Another lonely Friday night...I don't know how much more of it I can take. I don't know if I want to keep trying if it's just gong to be constant rejection. It seems inevitable I screw everything up and drive people away with my shitty personality I shouldn't even be surprised this happened but it still hurts so much ,Personality-disorder

50871,What I see on Instagram IS real and it's killing me inside A selfpitying post for your viewing pleasure Stop self harming by stalking people yada yada yada I know!!!! I know I know better!BUT.I'm sick of being told they only show the happy moments. No shit. But they have happy moments. They have adventures with friends that they post every other week or even just every month and some of them even post every week or more. I'm in my early 20s and so many people I went to high school with are traveling the world before they're tied down with more responsibilities and their bodies fall apart mine already is.... Not because they're rich but because they're simply financially comfortable and have connections with people social skills. And because they're not afraid to take risks. And because they've built a life for themselves an identity since early on in high school maybe even earlier which makes doing all of this feel normal to them makes it all so much easier for them.And if they're not traveling they're still going on smaller adventures with friends and gfsbfs. Or they're performing in a band at local venues and they're actually good now. Or they're about to graduate college. Envy kills me.I'm so fucked up I took a gap year to figure out what I want to do with my life only to drop out of an overpriced community college this year because I still feel too directionless.And I know I could have at least a small chance at what these people have if only I would get off my ass instead of sulking. I actually just checked more like stalked because I'm not following any of these people Instagram for the first time in months. Hurt even more than it did the last time. And in those months where I stopped looking at their lives did mine improve? Did pretending they aren't living happy fulfilling lives by avoiding their social media posts altogether make my life any better? Contrary to what every mentalhealthgurugenius on Reddit claims no it didn't make my life any better. I'm still stuck. I try my hardest every day and I'm still stuck.Sure. I've finally had a job at this point in my life retail but I snapped and quit. I can drive now though I hate it. I can go by the mall by myself and do some shopping not that I have money to spend. And yet it's nothing. It means nothing because it's not enough. Not enough for society and not enough to make me feel fulfilled because it means nothing without other people.,Personality-disorder

50873,The Strip Club pt.II This is in response to another post about the strip club. Anyway my friend took me and paid for a lap dance. From this experience I learned something. I don't think it's for me. In fact I think I'm a sexless sort of entity like a fungus or a germ. The part on stage was super awkward. I ended up trying to put money into the stripper's fat roll because I was too nervous to find the strap. Are you feeling my cringe?Then there's the fact that she spent a lot of time putting her butt in my face. So the thought of buttholes was just ever present and killed the mood for me. I was also hyper aware of my face and trying to either keep a straight face or look impressed don't give away that I'm not feeling it.Then my friend insisted on buying that same lady for the lap dance. I was trying to politely say no but he didn't understand. Also he bought two or three... Anyway she kept grinding up on me. Now another poster here told me that nobody would be paying attention to whether or not you become... aroused. But trust me she noticed. And she seemed kind of mad about it. And I ended up being depressed because I couldn't help but feel like something was wrong with me. I mean not even a twitch.I was so relieved when it was over. And I don't think I'm ever going back. Good learning experience I guess.,Personality-disorder

50880,I took public transit today. After not being able to step foot out of the house without my ex driving me I finally was able to step up and go on public transit by myself. Its been 2 years since Ive taken the bus. I honestly did not know what I was doing but I asked the drivers for help and directions as to which bus to get on next etc etc Social anxiety was at an all time high and still is writing this on the way home. So many people are on this bus and the only thing Im thinking about is when do I get home and why are they looking at me. Realistically theyre looking at me because people have eyes and observe whats in front of them and scolding myself that they dont have hidden agendas is helping lol. For anyone who hasnt been able to take public transit because of this stupid fucking difficult disorder I sympathize. It gets easier. Dont have much to say just wanted to share bc this is a massive achievement for me.,Personality-disorder
50881,At this point I dont think theres anything in this world that can cure this innate sense of loneliness inside me. Am I destined to be like this forever? Relationships seem pointless and I dont know if I could even handle being in one anyway. Ive basically been alone my whole life and I dont know how to be anything else. Ive never even had a crush on an actual person. It sounds conceited but nobody Ive met is interesting to me in that way and I feel like if I gave someone a chance Id just end up breaking their heart because of this nothingness inside me. Right now I cant even imagine myself being intimate with anyone and I feel like Im not emotionally available enough to have someone rely on me like that. Theyd probably end up feeling more like a burden to me more than anything and I dont want to do that to anyone.I really hope one day Im wrong and Ill meet someone that makes me feel a little more human but I dont have much hope.,Personality-disorder
50882,I get very down when people don't include me socially but But I don't even wanna get to know them at all? It's like I'll get sad and feel like no one wants to be around me and I'm excluded a lot. I'm never the first choice. But if I actually get it my way and get included and someone try to befriend me I suddenly lose interest and change my mind. It's very annoying. I know I actually don't wanna befriend anyone right now but I get sad when I'm excluded or not chosen regardless. I wish I could be more careless. I know why this is tho. Because if they actually show interest in befriending me and they find me pleasant to be around I will get kinda overexcited and will be with them at all times and sometimes that scares people away. It's either I avoid people like the plague or I get too attached. Both is equally as bad tbh. But I can't help but feel sad when I see people get along so well so easily and so fast while I'm sitting by myself. There's times I starve not on purpose but because I don't wanna sit in the cafeteria at school. Where do I even sit. This week I've only eaten two pizza slices and some candy also drank some chocolate milk. I just don't wanna be around anyone. I managed to grab some dinner from the cafeteria earlier tho I live on campus.I have two years left of my time at school and I'm trying to just force myself through it all. I know I won't get better and I can't try as much as I would like but I know I'll go back to being avoidant the second something goes wrong. I can be the most friendliest person you've ever met and be lively and bubbly but the very second someone shows the most minuscule sign they don't enjoy being around me I start to go into avoidant mode. I'll lock myself up in my room and go offline from all social medias play games all day appetite depletes and all that stuff. It can last for months.Well anyways that was just a little rant if you will. I don't have anyone to talk to obviously and thought maybe someone here would understand and relate. At least it helps a little,Personality-disorder
50883,Id rather be alone than feel like this Went on a date a week ago for the first time in years. Normally I am not attracted to people but this time I felt super attracted to this person. Good talks and the whole day we spent together. We had sex but I did not sleep at that persons place bc thats too intimate for me I see sex a something purely physical but sleeping is too scary for me. However that person didnt text me for a week so I texted to ask to go to a concert with a mutual friend. Still no response for 2 days. I feel so insecure and rejected and it confirms the negative view I already have about myself. I really would like to have a relationship and fall in love but even dating makes me feel so worthless ugly stupid and anxious even after one date. Sorry for the vent but this is the only place I feel I can share this. Other people say that I just need to relax stop overreacting and stop being insecure and blablabla. Thats why I never share these feelings with people,Personality-disorder

50885,My dog is teaching me just how destructive my mum was for me growing up and now. The other day my mum left the house and my dog had zoomies. I thought how strange. Maybe she is glad she has me all to herself.Then I became aware that all the tension went out the door with her.I've been so isolated with only my mum as 'company' that I forgot how different kind and cool other people can be. I'd become a bit of a misanthrope. However on walks I've met some really genuine and good people. It was shocking. I couldn't believe it. It's making me realise how harmful being in constant contact with my mother who is extremely toxic is for my affiliation with humans.I can't wait to move away from her. Maybe I'm not doomed to be alone.,Personality-disorder
50886,I just realised I don't seem to make friends Soooo...I'm 44 years old. I have a group of about 15 friends in my home town in another state to where I live but 14 of them I did not make. ALL of those 14 were made by my best friend back in school who I befriended at age 14 who is quite outgoing. And then we just had this friendship group which started at 4 and then eventually grew and I count them all as my friends but I never actually made any of them myself.I made not a single friend in university. I made 2 friends at my first job when I was 22 but we never saw each other outside the workplace and I haven't heard from them in 20 years since I left there.I made 2 friends at a subsequent workplace when I was about 30 but one kind of kept trying to be my friend SO insistently that eventually I gave in and she was fun and nice but I haven't seen her for over 10 years. The other one I realised later was my Favourite Person FP BPD lingo and that is the only reason I was interested enough to want to get to know her and want her to get to know me. I had a platonic crush on her. Even so after 2 years my interest fizzled and I haven't heard from her since also about 10 years ago.Then when I was 40 I made a friend here in my building she lives in my home town most of the year but has a place here too and she became my Favourite Person which again is why I let her in and we became close. Again my feelings of attraction fizzled after about 2 years and we're still friends but I hardly see her as she doesn't live here most of the time.So I feel like my friends are all mainly made via my original friend who I made at age 14. And now 30 years later...I still don't really have any friends and haven't really made any.Is that weird?,Personality-disorder
50887,Is it okay to appear rude to others? I find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others.The funny thing is I am continually day after day in my attempts not to appear this way am this way. I don't give solid eye contact to others mere glances I hide myself away in plain sight with poor meek body language I carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions.All in vain attempts of appearing in my delusional mind 'nice'. It is so self destructive you essentially let people walk over you ignore you in some desire to be liked. By people who dislike you will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours or simply horrible people who you wouldn't want to like you. Let me give an example of what I'm thinking. You're shopping for groceries you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else you need something on that shelf like a tin of food or something. Usually I will see this and think 'oh my god don't want them to know I need something there' heavens forbid if they see me what will they think? So I quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move.So instead why not stand in their shadow and wait patiently let your presence be seen in an ideal world ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when you're more confident? So yes stand next to them and don't budge just let them know non verbally you're waiting.Another example you're at the cashier they're doing your items I always look everywhere but where I need to look I lose focus on what I should be looking at which is the items I'm paying for the cashiers eyes in case they're trying to communicate something. And what if they say something small talk for instance well maybe I'm not in the mood to pursue further small talk so why not just give closed answers why do I feel the need to fill the silences to say whatever I can to appear 'normal'. I come across as flustered shy unconfident I see it in their faces they see the fear they see the disgust on my face believing I'm a wrongin or something but it's really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face then they mirror it. And I think awful things about myself. So why not stay calmer speak slower not try and have a positive small talk experience just take things at my own pace. Otherwise I leave feeling utterly embarrassed ashamed and the next time I shop there and there my cashier they're going to hate that I'm there. As opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty.I'm rambling a bit losing focus on my words sorry but some of that probably doesn't make sense. I hope you get the type of rude I'm talking about. It's not purposefully being rude. It's more being true to yourself being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal. Something I avoid.Any ideas or experiences suggestions on these niche topic please?,Personality-disorder

I legit had NO IDEA that I had it insanely bad up until now. Drunk friend got on top of me we made out she started undressing and I legit just stared at her BLANK. Had no idea what to do why she would do that and what to think. That's when it hit me. I'm an absolute social failure. I can never initiate anything I never talk about emotions and now I truly understand the only way I'll ever have sex is by getting raped. That's it. I CAN'T EVEN RETURN A FUCKING HUG! I don't want to be like this. I'm fucking 25 already. I legit didn't care about any of that until I realized how nice a kiss felt. I can only imagine what sex feels like. I fucking hate my life. I fucking hate I'll never get to be with someone because all I can do is shut inside myself and cry from a distance. Funny thing is I'm fit and average looking with a way above average salary. But it's all useless when I have absolutely 0 social skills. Fuck my parents and fuck my bullies. I can't go back in the past. I will always be like this. I already missed on my youth. It's legit not fair.,Personality-disorder
50893,Do therapists even understand AVPD? I generally like my therapist. I think he's the best one I've found so far. But today's session just proved that he doesn't understand. And I admit that my inability to open up is a barrier to make much progress. But I heard the same generic advice....go out. Meet people. Do something fun. And that's not BAD advice. Probably should do that. But the problem is every time I go out I feel anxious selfconscious and ashamed. I don't even think I have social anxiety. Shy but not on that level. I can handle BRIEF infrequent surface level conversations. Anything more than that is a nogo. So I seem more outgoing than I am. And it's like he focuses on my lack of relationships so that's what I bring up. I think it's because he's a solutionfocused therapist and he doesn't seem too concerned about the pastunderstanding one's self. Just do it pretty much. CBT. Opposite of feeling action. Which is all true. But honestly I isolate because I'm depressed. Which is why I don't maintain relationships or want to put myself out there. So I don't know what to do. I don't know what my problem is. I'm just over it. Older seasoned avpders if that's a thing any advice for me? Should I stick therapy out or just forget it? He's like the 3rd longterm ish therapist I've been with and I don't want to dump him out the blue like all the rest.,Personality-disorder

50895,does exposure therapy work for AvPD? Does exposure therapy or testing your fears work for AvPD?my therapist is pushing me into exposure therapy.

I try to get around it most times but when I have to i do it even though I feel anxious,Personality-disorder
50896,Am I a piece of shit or what? I mean I've never been diagnosed cause I'm afraid of going to the psychiatrist and discovering I'm a real shit but this days I was doing a personality check from Twitter just for the joke and the result avpd came so close home I felt offended.I grew up always walking behind my group of friends. I could never do anything apart from others. In any social situation it has always been my role to be the child in the corner or the one following the parents.It doesn't help my father is a controlling sexist. I've never slept out my own house never dated someone openly afraid he would beat me up never visited my friends houses I don't even know if I can call them friends.I'm nerdy but not smart. I always got high grades in school but I never liked being complimented on it because I thought most of my grades came from the cheating sheets I made to remember the subjects before the exams.If I have to talk with someone for anything I have a script in my head I have to follow to ensure I'm not saying anything idiot.After graduating from school I fell for my relative's advice and did not leave my hometown preferring to go to college in the neighboring city and work with that relative. Well we had a fight and I had to quit uni cuz I was fired.I couldn't muster up the strength to deliver resumes in my city due to sheer shyness.Five years have passed since then. I'm almost 23 years old. I'm just a high school graduate. No professional course taken no money in hand living with my parents...I still don't want to hand out resumes I don't want to get in touch with people... I long for physical contact but I don't have the courage to get close to anyone...So to you guys who suffer from avpd how do you cope with this shit? How do you guys have strength to work?Sorry my thoughts were all over the place while I was writing so please forgive me if it sounds confusing.,Personality-disorder
50897,my guinea pig passed and now there's just me i dont know if my flair is correct? idk. last night around 2 am she passed. my sweet lilith. i had her for a good 7 years and she was a darling so sweet and kind jumpy and squeaky all up until the last couple days where she suddenly became so tired. her last day came around and i just felt it. she was so exhausted. i tried to get her into my local vet yesterday but they said they didnt have time for her that day? so we stuck it out hoping i would get her in today but. there wasnt time. i gave her as much water as she would take before she passed tried to feed her and mostly just. talked to her and praised her and loved her. i held her all night. she hadnt eaten in a day already aside from the very few nibbles she'd taken from what i tried to give her. tomato was her favorite food so i brought her some tomato last night as she was on her last leg. it was her last treat. i was surprised she came running for it despite her exhaustion and she had a little nibble. just a little. i wanted her to have more but she was so tired and im glad she had even that. everything seemed so much for her. she snuggled with me in some of her last moments before i tucked her back in her cage where she felt safest. and she passed. i have friends but not very close ones anymore as ive isolated myself so much. i feel very very alone and i dont know if there's anything else for me here. i think there's probably not. im so so tired and im ready to give up. my parents are going away for the weekend and with the way things are lining up i wonder if now is the time. i guess im just posting this to vent or maybe to have someone for a little bit or maybe a call for help or something. i dont know. but im so tired and sad and afraid and alone and im so over it all. i want it to end so badly and. idk. im sorry i really am i just want it all to end. i want it to be over so badly.,Personality-disorder
50898,I hate my crush for further reinforcing my insecurities I met him on vacation and we hung out for two days together at the swimming pool. I'm a very socially anxious person but with him I felt like I've known him for years. One night he told other teenagers that he liked me. They all told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriend's here. I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. Ever. All my life I was treated as a freak so I was just glad for this opportunity for something special. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and got really mad at our friends for telling me.He cut off all contact with with me after. I blocked him on Instagram after he rejected my Instagram request. I was so sad that the guy I liked decided it would be best if he never saw me again. The one person who saw me for all the good I have to offer and he still gave it up. They broke up two months later and he still looks at my social media. We're not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. I've never had the privilege of falling in love before and he just took it away from me. How could we truly ever be in love when he didn't want me? When he chose to let me fall into the abyss? I trusted him. I had confidence that he was a nice person and it was all a lie.,Personality-disorder
50900,Why am I such a loser I take online classes and only leave my house for therapy or medical appointments. I am usually too afraid to talk to people online even in anonymous online spaces. I've always been a loner but for about a year it's been worse than ever. Literally zero friends. The severe isolation has caused me to forget how to socialize and behave around other people. I get so awkward and nervous and don't know how to carry on normal conversations. Even the dialogue in my writing is unnatural and weird. I see people online and even in this sub who aren't total loners and have friends or even partners. How? Why is everything so hard for me? Why can't I just be normal and function like everyone else?,Personality-disorder
50901,I wish I could socialize normally and make friends No matter what social setting Im in Im always the odd one out. I feel like I physically cant talk. I only speak when someone initiates and even then the conversation just ends almost instantly cause of my bad social skills. I wanna be normal and be able to make small talk and actually have relationships with people. I feel so alone and I dont know how to change. Im 22 and wish I could have friends and go out like other people my age. Was considering going to the Disney college program but I know itll just be the same no friends and Ill just be the weirdo everyone avoids. Please I really want to change my life I need some advice. Did medicine or therapy help any of you? Did anyone get better on their own? A part of me just wants to be courageous and force myself to talk to people. I know Ill be unsuccessful but maybe Ill get better with time ,Personality-disorder

50903,I confronted my kid's teacher today My kid has been having issues with this teacher all year. They really struggle with concentration and memory and the teacher has been terribly unsupportive. It's the only class my kid has been failing.A few months ago my kid was diagnosed with cancer. We set up a 504 to reduce the amount of assignments and give them extended time.They were then out of school for two weeks for surgery. All of their teachers except the problem teacher followed the 504 and greatly reduced the amount of their makeup assignments.Regardless my kid worked hard to turn in a large portion of the assignments. Yet they're still failing that class.I emailed the teacher today to make sure she graded all the assignments. She told me she did but otherwise did not give me any helpful information in getting my child's grade up. I then asked if she has been following the 504 plan and I've not received a response.I've already been second guessing whether I was too aggressive in my emails but at the same time I feel like I'm going to have to escalate it with the school.I'm stressed and I've been fucking sick to my stomach all day. I'm cycling between anger and embarrassment and I'm going nuts.Just needed to vent Edited Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I've been in continued correspondence with the teacher. She stated that she has already reduced the amount of work but I still have issue with the amount and content.I also elaborated on the fact that my child has been having issues all year only in this class. My child has told me they're afraid of this teacher and they struggle with her teaching methods. The teacher had no helpful comments and has only repeated that the issue is missing assignments as if I don't have eyes. She also said she thinks they can turn this semester around if we can motivate them and thinks they are not having academic difficulties. This rubs me the wrong way because motivation starts in the classroom and she's clearly been lacking.PT conferences are tomorrow I'll be talking with the principal.,Personality-disorder
50904,How do you make therapy work? I dont know what to do in therapy we usually just sit there in silence as my therapist does grounding exercises saying things like notice the things around you your breaths all your senses etc to help with my anxiety and then she asks the dreaded question What do you want to work on today? Like hell if I know even when I do know I wont say it cause of my anxiety. I told her about my anxiety and possible AVPD which weve been learning about together even though its information I already know but honestly at least were doing something. I want to get deep into my trauma my mentality my thought processes who I am just everything about what caused this hell but I feel like were getting nowhere because my therapist doesnt bring us anywhere. Its like asking a blind man for directions. I tried telling her that I like it when she leads the conversation which she has been trying but in the end shes not leading enough. I know in therapy a therapist shouldnt lead and let the patient control their session but honestly I just wish someone would ask me a bunch of very leading harsh to the point questions with no way out so I can talk about my feelings without feeling guilty and selfish or embarrassed.ampx200BI know nobody is probably going to answer but in the minuscule chance that you do you have my Eternal thanks and appreciation.,Personality-disorder

50906,Fried my personality I feel bad for making another post here but I just want to see if anyone has experienced this and recovered. I feel like being isolated and particularly avoidant over the last year has completely fried what little personality I had. I think a mix of depression apathy and mental anguish from little human contact has left me as this husk of a person. I was never good at connecting with people but now it seems impossible. I'm so distant and just don't have it in me to feign excitement or interest during social interactions anymore. I'm not sure how to work on things when I'm this robot with no substance to my character. It makes every attempt to speak to someone strange and awkward. It makes me feel like I have nothing to offer to another person in a conversation or interaction.,Personality-disorder

I made a hair consultation appointment and had to get the bus then walk a long way through town to get there. Saw loads of people around my age with friends socialising laughing. It hurt so much. Then at the hairdresser being reminded Im not normal as I try and fake being so for the consultation. Next week I have to sit an hour and 45 minutes while they dye my hair.

Changing my number and not giving it to anyone I suffer from really severe social anxiety to the point where I even isolated myself from my family. I feel like I have nothing here. No friends no job I messed up my relationship with my family by barely leaving my room. They all think Im awkward and weird. It doesnt help Ive become a pretty bitter and rude person over the last couple years because of how miserable I am in my life my fault I know. Feel like I have screwed my life up too much Im an embarrassment and want to go where nobody will recognize me My mom was ashamed of me ever since I started being socially anxious around 6th grade. She hated how quiet and unpopular I was. She can also be very clingy overprotective and worried too much. I cant handle it anymore I feel totally smothered. I just want to get out on my own even if Im living in my car for a while. But I am starting to feel extremely guilty because I know shes going to freak out when she sees the note probably have a panic attack and call the whole family probably telling them Im missing. I feel like my parents do not trust me whatsoever and see me as some useless idiot that will never be able to have her own life Im planning on alternating between motels sleeping in my car and working my way up to renting a room in someones house somewhere,Personality-disorder
50909,Im scared of going to college Im a senior in high school and after being on this subreddit for a month Im terrified of going to college. Granted I was terrified before that. Before I figured Id take a gap year to figure things out and I didnt feel like I was in a good position to do well in college. But now Im realizing I was just avoiding applying because I was scared to be rejected. Or maybe I was scared of what would happen if I was accepted. I dont know what I want to get into and its scary how relatable a lot of these post feel. And what scares me more is that I keep seeing posts about people having to tell their parents they dropped out of college. Is that going to be me??? Am I just going to be a drop out?? Should I even try?? I dont know but now Im worried Im going to get to comfortable once Im out of school and will be too scared to return.

I had to send an email to a coworker explaining how far i reached in solving an issue so they can take over but i have made 0 progress in it even though i took 2 fucking weeks for it. I also can't say that i didn't make any progress because i told my boss otherwise. I just don't start my work itself because I am too scared to encounter new issues that i won't be able to solve. Procrastination is fucking me up. I don't even know what or why I am typing. I feel i just keep feeling sorry for myself and don't really do much to improve.Anyways I am preparing side by side for a career shift but i dont see how it would be much better as the issue mainly lies with me and everyone in my job are great people. I just think way to hard on how to appear a certain way to others because I base my self worth on others opinion of me which I am trying to change but honestly don't see it getting much better.I went to different psycologists and psychiatrists in the past but never sticked to any. My mind kept finding reasons to not continue even tho some of the meds helped me at the time. I will probably go to a therapist again. Thank you if you read so far.

I dont have much contact with her as she ran away for drugs when I was a kid but have tried to be a part of her life now for a few years. She was in rehab and were now a recovering alcoholic and drug addict but then she called me the other day very drunk and it hurt me so much and made me worried. I sent a message to my family member who has the most contact with her where I said she was drinking again that I feel really sad and I dont know what to do feel helpless etc. I also sent something similar to my grandpa because hes working with her she lives in a psychiatric apt. Now its been days and Ive gotten no response. I feel anxious and regret sending the messages they probably think I was on drugs or crazy for sending desperate messages like that and therefore not responding. I want to unsend the messages but Im not sure if that would be acceptable to do or look weirder if I do that. Im considering texting my grandpa something else after unsending but my other family member I dont know that well and cant really do that. I realize I shouldnt text her again after this as its obvious she wants no contact and now Ive embarrassed myself.Would you unsend in this situation? Or any other good advice?Sorry for the rant.,Personality-disorder

50919,I haven't replied to someone for 30 weeks . Thankfully this person was not a close friend at all they were an acquaintance but God I feel so embarrassed that I never replied. What must they think of me . Because we were only acquaintances this person literally won't miss me but it's moreso the fact I've probably came across as extremely rude that is upsetting. I'm not sure if I should just leave it now or if I should message and apologise and tell them I won't be replying anymore. I should have done this aggges ago and told them that I won't be replying anymore instead of just avoiding for 30 fucking weeks.I think messaging to let them know what happened would be a good idea but I should have done it she's ago. If I did it now I would feel so anxious about messaging them. Maybe they hate me now and don't want me to message them ever again. Idk guys .Edit I don't think I will message them because there isn't really any point the friendship is obviously over and I don't plan on trying to reignite it I wish I could but it's too difficult. I did briefly tell this person that I have issues with replying to people so I'm praying that they won't be mad at me and instead would have attributed my absence to this.

But I often think about the people that went out there way to be nice to me they would have got noting out of it they did it just to be nice maybe they could see I was shy and lonely and had pity for me so they would talk or smile or say good morning to me to make me feel like a human being even though people pitying me makes me feel embarrassed and small I appreciate it so much but Im never able to show it so I just pray for them every day and hope they are having amazing lives and I hope they know they are angels.,Personality-disorder

50930,AvPD or something else? Sorry if this is actually completely normal or offtopic. Basically I find myself so genuinely hideous in a You look too ridiculous to seriously expect anyone to acknowledge you as a fellow human being kind of way. It doesn't just stop at my appearance either. It's literally every single facet of my being that is too ridiculous to ever be taken seriously. It prevents me from talking to people finding a well paying job making friends of any kind doing literally anything out of the ordinary including necessary appointments like the doctor or even wanting to be alive. The only person I see regularly now outside of work is my therapist who insists there isn't anything wrong with me as a person but I find it incredibly hard to believe he doesn't see just how unbelievably embarrassing and stupid I am. This feeling causes me constant distress and is completely unshakeable even though I am aware of how logically silly it is and I worry it might mean I have a personality disorder because it handicaps every part of my life. Obviously no one on here can diagnose me but I guess I am wondering if it sounds similar to what you guys deal with.,Personality-disorder
50931,Root of avpd and lifedamaging thoughts I had M21. My problem with avpd is that it made me weak defenseless I feel like prey living among predators.My self esteem is low and I know how it can be increased it just requires me to be strong and all the problems will eventually disappear.I was bullied by two different group of people I realize now the reason was that they instantly saw my weakness the second time I was bullied by my friends at that time initially they even respected me cause I was serious but when you can't defend yourself it looks pathetic and I even can see their perspective you just need to be more tough and confident without any reason.This experience reflected in my thoughts I was living with till recentlywhen I was a kid I thought you need to really know how to dance know the technique or some kind of particular style but thinking about my stupid rural relatives refuted it cause how they being so stupid could think about it really it's not possible but they fuck I don't.second was about clothes hypebeasts.I thought classmates were making fun of me cause I looked weird lame. Even though it's not fully wrong I just exaggerated it on a new extreme level. There wasn't particularly anything wrong with my clothes I just couldn't understand their reaction.Third was about thinking that the group of people knew something that I missed or like there was some hidden context I was unaware of. It was a constant thought when I was with my peers.I also has such problem that I often can't decide when I should feel offended and when not it's important cause it can really lead to being a punching bag. This is also a beginning of my PPD part of personality. This kind of thinking leads to paranoia.I hope I won't regret posting this. Maybe it's the only time I can be honest.,Personality-disorder

I've gotten really close with him and I am so fuckin glad I befriended him. He's really loving kind and patient. He's assertive out there and also very protective while I'm very quiet meek and also generally on edge and easily spooked so he balances me out and calms me very well. I can tell he cares very deeply about me and he's accepting of my differences. I told him about my avpd and he has been very understanding and helpful. His attitude and actions have given me a really big confidence boost in our friendship and just in general. I feel a lot more comfortable just existing and taking up space. Even tho i still struggle a lot having a supportive and caring friend has helped me tremendously and I'm planning to keep him around for a very long time ,Personality-disorder
50935,anyone else feel like isolationconstant lack of interaction is turning them into a hateful person? I mean i do have various have mental issues but i think chronic isolation in particular is a big part of why I'm growing into such a bitter and hateful person.Objectively it's not really much of a problem because i'm alone all the time so it's not like i'm being actively hateful or offensive towards others. But yeah basically it seems that whenever i hear sth concerning other people be it celebrities or strangers on the internet or whatever i am either jealous or upset. these are my only reactions i don't empathise anymore. it's kinda starting to affect my beliefs as well but I'm aware that it's more of an emotional issue than anything and I don't plan on being alive for much longer so no need to worry about that,Personality-disorder
50936,I cant do it anymore Im alone with my struggles and it has reached a point where its only suffering Unfortunately I dont really have someone I can tell this so this will be my venting space right now. The only thing currently holding me alive is my family. If they didnt care and love me I would have kms years ago. But now I really wish theyd just abandon me and stop caring because I really dont want to live anymore. Really I hate to say this but their love just makes it worse. What do I owe them? But yeah the thought of how theyd react if I did it is so bad that it currently holds me back. I do have friends but they either never reach out to me or if they do its in a context of meeting as a group and that happens like 2 times a year. Some of those people do stuff together I came to know but not once was I asked to join. And I have a best friend whos just weird. Idk why I even call him my best friend maybe because I know him since 19 years and we did stuff together he as well never reaches out by himself and when I do almost always declines is busy. On those rare occasions we meet I never get asked a question. No one ever showed interest in me besides my ex girlfriend but thats another story. I dont really have a perspective. Because I was lazy struggled in school as a teen I hold a diploma which is almost useless. Cant study but dont want to do the soul crushing labor I did before.If I want to change something about my situation I would need to put in tons of effort but my batterys empty I cant charge it no more and no one gives me a new one,Personality-disorder
50937,Becoming indifferent about relationships I havent been around anyone outside of my family in two weeks and Im really content with it. For the first time in a while I dont feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness because theres nothing to compare myself to. I dont have to worry about being asked about myself or being expected to be social. I like it this way. I dont know what this means though. Im dreading having to go back to class next week because everything I want to avoid comes back. Im tired of the pressure that my lack of social skills and low self esteem brings. No ones looking at me and judging. Im not constantly thinking I look awkward and shifting in my chair to look as normal as possible. I can breathefor once. No default answers to questions. No fake laughs. Just me. I know I cant stay in this shell foreverbut I like it here.,Personality-disorder
50938,I have to tell my family I dropped out of college immediately Its all coming to a boiling point.My mother says You need to go into what you need to do for graduation or if you are not doing the ceremony then please be kind enough to tell me now.Of course Ive known for months that graduation is not happening. Im too afraid to tell them and admit Im so sick. Ive been lying the whole time and I feel disgusting. But even if Im too afraid to tell them they will know eventually theres either a ceremony to attend or theres not and come to their own conclusions of me. They are extremely abusive people and I know they are going to shame me severely. They are the reason I even have this disorder in the first place and now I have no choice but to sit there and let them blame and shame me for having it. I cant handle living alone right now or being completely by myself. I feel I have no choice but to throw myself into the flames and let any confidence I had left burn awayPain is the only option I have on all sides. I dont know how to deal with any of this.,Personality-disorder
50939,vent I honestly hate my life I think everything sucks and nobody is cool. I don't have any friends. I have people I can occasionally speak to once a week sure but I don't have any friends. I don't even call my boyfriend half the time so i just constantly feel like I'm in some sort of simulation. I can't make friends because my autism greatly impedes how likeable i seem and the only people who do pay attention to me are guys that wanna fuck me because I'm attractive so i end up speaking to no one i just hate it here.,Personality-disorder
50940,My strange twosided life Hi I'm 25 M new to to this subreddit and also to Reddit. I am not diagnosed with AvPD so far but I am able to relate to almost all the posts here. My parents are loving but the rest of the family on my dad's side is fucked up. My dad and his siblings are all suffering from some or the other disorder Not all are diagnosed though because no one takes mental health seriously in my family. Everyone's super selfcentred to the core. But it is the exact opposite on my mom's side. All of my mom's siblings cousins and their kids get along great while I feel like an outsider.I was terribly bullied in middle school because I reflected the behaviour I saw back at home. Also because I had started watching porn. This went on for a few years. I learnt to build a shell around my myself to prevent people from seeing my true self. This shell has hardened to such an extent that nobody I repeat nobody has access to the person within. I have since been the mature kid in school and focussed primarily on academics. I made it to one of the best universities in my home country. A couple of years into university I realised that I had a lot of friends but there was no one I could truly call a close friend. No one knew anything about me. I collaborated with a lot of people both academically and in extracurricular activities but never got close enough to anyone. At that time I didn't think much of it mainly because I was doing well according to the norm. I bagged some great internships and a wellpaying job right out of college. Interestingly this did not seem to affect my job. I performed exceptionally well and received great reviews both in the technical and interpersonal front. But as you might have guessed it already no one knew me out of work. Again I ignored this and remained focussed on my work.Then I decided to go for a master's and got accepted into one of the top graduate schools in the US. I have completed a term here. I started noticing this problem again during my first term after meeting and talking to people. It's not like I can't come up with things to talk about but everything seems very superficial. There is no intimacy in any of the conversations. Also it feels like people behave differently when they talk to me.I am not really interested in people's life and it is extremely exhausting to pretend otherwise. What's sad is that from the outside it looks as though I'm doing great and living the best life. There are people that look up to me and dream to achieve what I have achieved. But no one knows the truth not even my parents. This post is the most candid I have ever been in my life. I don't reveal anything about myself to anyone. I have never been in a relationship and at this rate I'm afraid I will never be. I want to turn my life around before it's too late. I'm not sure how my family would react to therapy. I don't have enough money to fund it myself.To end this vent the details I have added in this post are not intended for bragging. I totally understand that people have suffered worse. Those are just to emphasize what an absolutely perfect twosided mess my life has become.,Personality-disorder
50941,I lie so much Does anyone else realize how much they lie to themselves and other people. I always rationalize it because I sometimes do it to protect my feelings or others' feelings but that doesn't make it any less wrong or cowardly.,Personality-disorder
50942,I dont see a point in getting better anymore or healing Honestly what is the point Im so sick of people going on about how much they wish they didn't miss out on things when they were younger I just don't care anymore I spent a whole 6 monthes bulling myself to do things out of existential fear and I'm so exhausted I want to do nothing ever again I'm so tired what is even the point If you get better your just going to be left as nothing but a empty shell or worse you'll become one of THEM I just want to have my joker moment completely self destruct and then die,Personality-disorder
50943,What is wrong with me I am in a relationship that I have wanted out of for the last idk how long. I cant break up with him. I have three times and every time weve gotten back together within 24 hours. I love him and I keep getting back with him but I just dont want to be with him anymore. Ive already posted about this here before since that post I did take everyones advice and break up with him but I didnt block him on everything and we ended up getting back together literally the next day. Why am I like this? What is wrong with me?We have had a messy relationship to say the least and despite how its not as messy anymore I just dont want to be with him. But I love him so much when Im with him I dont actually want to leave him. I know if I break up with him I will regret it eventually. I know if I break up with him again it will break his heart. When were talking everything is fine we rarely fight anymore and he does everything he can to resolve issues now because I know hes scared Im going to break up with him again. That makes me feel bad and also want to stay with him. Its a cycle of this. I just cant be real with him I cant be normal with him I cant be honest with him. I am a bad person its like I want to be unhappy.,Personality-disorder
50944,How much detail do you give when reaching out to people you've ghosted? I feel like I cannot move forward with my life until I right my wrongs and reach out to people I know I've hurt from ghosting. I wrote a 'letter I'll never send' mainly for my own benefit with way too much information about my life and my struggles but it seems way too intense to actually send out. I feel ready to take the next step of actually making contact but I just don't know how much information to give. Is a simple apology sufficient? This might be the avpd talking but I worry that by giving too much information I'll come off like I'm trying to justify the pain I've caused. I also dread the fact that they'll know how sad my life is but that cannot be avoided I guess. For those who have done it successfully any tips?,Personality-disorder
50945,Makes me sad when people delete their postscommentsaccounts. I'll admit I've been guilty of this many times myself. I don't know why I always feel shame even though it's anonymous. As a reader I've never once regretted reading something where it felt like someone put a part of themselves into words. I don't know why the same logic doesn't carry over when you're the writer. I wish I could tell them that I thought they had something valuable to say. Reading your words made me feel connected. There are more people out there reading than you think. You deserve to be heard.,Personality-disorder
50946,Do you guys feel like a makeawish kid when trying to meet new people? Idk how else I could explain this but I often feel like people are trying their hardest to be gentle welcoming and polite when they're internally wishing I never engaged with them in the first place. People always treat me so weirdly that I just have my alarm beeping all the time and I have to actively switch it off because I cannot tell anymore what's fake positive and what's actually a true warning. Guess I'll give up the social stuff and just stick to loneliness feeling like a stray dog around normal people is the most painful feeling ever.,Personality-disorder
50947,DAE struggle to talk to people they like? I've been focusing on identifying people I truly personally like in therapy. Or well. More like validating my own opinions but it always comes back to people. I have a net of people I'm really 'close' with because of the way my uni living was set up. And I'm realizing through a lot of questions that there are people I just don't actually like I'm surrounding myself with? Or people I want to interact with more that I know will make me happier compared to my current friend group.But I can't help but think that anybody I would actually enjoy talking to couldnt possibly like me as a result. I think it's become a selffulfilling prophecy. The more I criticise myself the more I pull back the less I interact with people and the world and the less 'worthy' I am. But the flavor of people I enjoy are the hardworking driven nice ones. They wouldnt gossip about me behind my back nobody cares enough to do that. But I would feel like such a charity case. When I'm doing okay it's okay. When I'm not I hate the thought that I'm forcing my prescense on these people. That my attention to turned towards how shitty and empty I feel all the time and not the other spicy things that give life flavor.,Personality-disorder
50948,must bargain with the universe for social plans so my 18ftm coworker evilyn 19f was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house. she said she'd be down and now i'm just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on SC. she mentioned having extra tickets but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15 each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets? it's not unreasonable i know if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100 platonic because we're coworkers and i think she knows i'm gay the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls. but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. another fear evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with jonah 20M our other coworker a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake let's not. as in they've hung out outside of work more than once. now i don't think jonah is the petty type but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know. rambling post but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere. this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone. mainly in my own head i have to earn outings by going over everything that could go wrong and by being of use ie giving her a ride without expecting a free ticket. yeeeah it's a lot. thanks for reading all ,Personality-disorder
50949,DAE avoid taking care of your appearance? I don't mean personal hygiene. Like avoiding skincare not caring abt your hair dressing as baggy and blandly as possible not doing makeup. I just desperately don't want any attention. I don't want girls to comment anything about my cute outfit I don't want men to stare at me. I want to be invisible,Personality-disorder
50950,Depressive personality disorders Hi from what I can gather about Depressive personality disorder is it's a lot like AvPD but I can't seem to find out much about treatment for it. Or if it is even treatable. I took the mcmi iii and scored 111 115 is as high as it goes have AvPD DPD and masochistic traits as well. But they seem to be coming down.

50956,Has anything actually worked for anyone? When I say Ive tried it allI mean it. Every medication you can name except MAOIs because I actually medically cant take them. CBT DBT EMDR ketamine infusions Ketamine nasal spray TMS talk therapy and about a million other things. Its just been getting worse and worse. Now I cant even sing in the shower without the fear of my neighbors hearing me so I just dont sing. Cant sing in front of my mom. And I know I can sing I sang in a band for years when I was young and now it makes me nauseous to think about. I barely leave my house. If I go to a restaurant I think everyone is staring at me and judging me and I know they arent but my brain doesnt listen. If Im having a bad skin day acne wise then I dont leave the house even if I have shit to do. I physically cannot talk to strangers. I would give anything to not care what people think and to just be carefree. Im one step away from becoming an agoraphobicand I am a musician!! Its ruining my life like my friends dont even talk to me anymore. Im ready to off myself tbh because this shit is making my depression about a million times worse. And my autism tbh because I feel like my sensory issues have gotten wayyyy worse. And I just wanna know has anyone has success? Because I have no hope left. And I need some right about now.but my therapist and psychiatrist told me theres nothing else I can do for you.EDIT on anxiety meds Buspiron Xanax and Ativan and depression meds Nortriptyline and Ive tried everything else. I also meditate every day I have my medical weed card and I do yoga,Personality-disorder
50957,when i hear my name called i feel extremely uncomfortable and i feel like i did something wrong. i dont know if this has anything to do with AvPD or noti'm 20 years old and i think i suffer from Avpd u can check my other posts herethis is a problem i noticed recentlylets say I'm talking to someone and if shehe calls me by my name i feel extremely uncomfortable i feel like i did something wrong so i dont want to talk anymore and end the conversation there. it happens both in real life and online. if someone says my name its a big turn off for me. normally people dont even know my name people in my class etc. they dont use my name at all. i just wonder is there anyone here in the same situation?,Personality-disorder
50958,Feeling like an empty body with nothing inside. Im a 24 year old female and I never developed my own personality. I also suspect I have autism because I did a lot of research and I just know my brain is wired differently. I cant hold friendships and I hurt them because I keep them on a distance. They cant help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low. Because of this I have a lot of traumas. When I was a kid I was neglected by my parents because they were addicts. I lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause I tried to commit suicide. It wasnt a serious attempt. I just didnt know how to get out of the situation. Anyway Im 24 now and Ive learned a lot so far. Between my 1822 I did a lot of drugs and I felt normal. I felt like people wanted to be friends with me because I was social and talkative and not scared at all. But deep down I knew it was fake. The friendships I build were fake. I tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in. And next to that I was in an abusive relationship. I was paranoid and stressed. Always scared theyd find out the real me. And I did this for so long I dont even remember who I am right now. I am depressed diagnosed with ptsd AvPD and traits of borderline disorder. I asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didnt think I have enough traits to fit the criteria. I dont really care about labels but I feel like there is something really wrong with me. Im an alien in this world. It feels so alone.Sorry for the long text. Im prone to addiction and Im addicted to Xanax right now. I get admitted to a rehab clinic this Friday for 21 nights and then straight after that to Portugal for intense therapy. Im glad to have this opportunity and Ill definitely get out of my comfort zone. I know they wont fix my problems but itll hopefully give me the push I need to work hard. Cause I do believe I can find out who I am and make real friends without being fake. I have hope and I want you to have it tooWere all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important getting out of your comfort zone. Do things that are scary. Take baby steps. Dont set the bar too high for yourself. Everyone is different so you cant compare yourself to others.Good luck everyone and just keep swimming,Personality-disorder
50959,I moved out. A friend of mine was talking to me about my family situation and I told him about how I wanted to put distance between me and them. He said that he might have some ideas and that we could work something out.I've been in a new place now for five days. I have a roommate he is cool. His work keeps me from seeing him very much so I only have to deal with other people in small doses. The best thing is that I'm finally away from my relatives! It always feels weird when I say I miss you too over the phone because I don't miss them at all. I'm so happy to finally be freed of them!People do keep telling me that it's natural for me to feel this way and that I'll miss them eventually but I don't want to miss them. I had to go back earlier today to pick up some of my stuff but I dreaded seeing anyone there. I left as soon as I could and I guess I just don't know how to feel now. I still love them I never didn't love my relatives but I know they're not good for me. I am much better on my own. I guess I just feel guilty like I owe them something. Part of me wants to go back and try to fix them but I have to keep reminding myself that I can't do that and that they're not my responsibility. So I'm determined to not go back for as long as possible. The only reason I'd go back now is to get my bike but I can be without that for a while. Otherwise I'm done belonging to them. I am my own person now and I'm slowly getting to like who I'm becoming.I definitely still have many times where I hate myself for messing something up or blaming myself for something that can't be helped or just wasn't my fault. But overall things are getting better and me leaving my relatives behind is just one of many steps in the right direction.,Personality-disorder
50960,Church made it worse I've been telling my therapist that I've wanted to go to church for a while. The last time I went was last Easter. So today I pushed myself to go with God's help but I didn't really enjoy it. I felt selfconscious during worship. I couldn't get outside my own head. When the service was over I just left while most people stayed to mingle. Being around a lot of people makes it worse. Most people go to church in families. Not all. But I couldn't walk up to another person who came alone out of fear. Then I went to the park which was another mistake. Seeing all the children and couples enjoying themselves was too much. No one goes alone to the park on Sundays. So I tried not to isolate but it was too painful and now I want to isolate again. I'm so useless.,Personality-disorder
50961,does anxiety play a part in your avpd? i have anxiety disorders one being social anxiety so i experience a lot of anxiety with my avpd. when it comes to social situations my anxiety is so high that im sweating heart is pounding and it feels like my brain shuts down completely. it causes me to fail so badly at socializing even more than i already would it doesnt give me time to hear what people are saying or to give myself the time to think of a response. its embarrassing how i react internally cause it causes me to react externally in a way i wouldnt want to. id like my brain to be calm and relaxed so that i can properly think of my reactions and responses but nope i end up looking like a fool which leads to more self hate and feelings of ineptness. does anyone have experiences like this?,Personality-disorder
50962,I don't make decisions or have preferences? I don't know if this is AvPD but It's like I can't make decisions for myself based on what I want or even if someone needs me to do something I constantly ask for reassurance I'm doing it correctly. If I don't feel totally confident I'll just sit there and wait till I can ask.I unironically use dice rolling and stuff to make decisions for me so I can kind of appear neutral always almost like a scapegoat? So if people don't like It I can just say I didn't really make the choice.I just feel so terrified of making the wrong choice all the time. Sorry if wrong place or if i put it badly but this has really affected me as far back as I can remember.,Personality-disorder
50963,Its impossible to think for myself. Ive always been 100 selfless. I put everyone first and I dont give myself the time of day for nearly anything. There have only been a few times where Ive stood up and tried to prioritize myself and it always ended in a dumpster fire. I always get put down by others and myself. I feel like the universe is trying to punish me for trying to care about myself. Ive been looking into what I want to do career wise and Im leaning towards my dream job and becoming a mortician. Ive never told anyone about my interest in the job because I know people will be very judging about it. I was talking to my mom earlier about career stuff and I got brave enough and told her about it. You can probably guess how she reacted. But she didnt nearly react as harsh enough as my dad did. He walked into the room as we were talking and mom looked at him and went She wants to be a mortician. He instantly stopped moving and stared at me for 2 whole minutes with this absolute disgust on his face. He already made me feel like a disappointment without him opening his mouth yet. After what seemed like an eternity he said in a low and disgusted tone Youre kidding me then slowly turn around and walked away like I pissed him off or something.People have reacted in that similar fashion to a lot of my interests. I know that field of work is looked in a taboo way by some people but I havent had such an unsettling judgmental self esteem killing reaction like that in a while. I dont know why it hit me as hard as it has but it did. How am I going to be able to function if I cant handle people reacting about what my passions are like that? Every time I try to climb out of this abyss I get hit with the tiniest pebble of judgment and it causes me to lose my grip and fall down deeper than I was before and the cycle just continues.I feel so stupid thinking I could pull it off. I actually thought I could go into a job like this. Im honestly giving up. Im just going to stick to what Im good at most of the time and just stay quiet. Im never gonna get anywhere in life without AvPD reminding me that all Im good at is telling people what they want to hear and stay in my room.,Personality-disorder
50964,Fantasising causing issues with my sleep It seems like no matter how tired I am whenever I go to bed I just lay there thinking about hypothetical situations that are unlikely to ever happen. Generally it'll be fantasies for lack of a better word about potential relationship situations or generally sometimes just social situations and it's absolutely ruining my ability to sleep. I'm distracting myself with other things for hours just in an effort to be too tired to fantasise but it happens anyway and my sleeping pattern is being ruined because of it.Anyone do the same or any advice on how to ease off on this?,Personality-disorder

I get so remorseful of the fact know one really knows me or gotten to know me properly and Ive never felt like I could be my full self around anyone and its all my own fault. I feel like Im not good enough to have friends or acquaintances whenever people talk to me or give me the time of day I feel like theyre just doing it out of pity or theyre just talking to me so they can laugh at me to feel better about themselves.,Personality-disorder

50968,AvPD moms and Dads Does anyone think their mother or father has AvPD? I am pretty sure my dad has it. I see little signs here and there sometimes and just what I've been told as well. He has a hard time finding a real job until he was 26. By real job I don't mean anything fancy I just mean fulltime steady work. He had a hard time asking store clerks where an item was located. When I asked him how he overcame his extreme shyness he replied that my mom bossed out it out of him. She has introverts in her family but they can be loud and opinionated as well. My dad will talk on the phone when necessary but would never have a 2hour phone call just for the sake of it. There is just other signs here and there.ampx200BHave you seen any signs in your mom or dad or other relatives? I know there's a genetic component and you mix that with environment and boom you get to deal with this lovely disorder.,Personality-disorder

50970,Am I missing out on life?? I have am currently in my final year of med school and am 23 right now. I havent been in any relationships yet and am still a virgin even though all my friends are in relationships or having flings and I feel really horrible about it. 2 years ago I was sad that I didnt even have a social life in college but luckily I found a good small group of friends but my love life in college has just been a series of unrequited loves which has left me anxious and hurt for most of my college life. I feel major fomo and maybe that Im unlovable as a person and I sometimes make peace with that but hearing my friends have romantic or sexual experiences really makes me feel shitty again. I feel really happy for my friends and even give them advice when ask me for it although idk why they ask me lmao but I dont know what to anymore and if this will stay this way forever.,Personality-disorder

I believe it's natural that this sort of content sparks great desire in any guy. I think it's also safe to say that 90 of guys will never have a chance with a girl like that. So I'd say it should be normal for these guys to feel some resentment unfulfillment jealousy sadness selfdoubt etc.This isn't however what I'm observing in reality. Generally these kind of content on social media receives countless upvotes and praise from guys.Can someone explain where is my reasoning flawed?,Personality-disorder
50973,I realize I am the problem. The thing is I long have realized I am the problem. But I dont want to bother people anymore with my problems. My AvPD is becoming so much worse five months into my first job. I just dont want to bother people yet people keep talking sht about me. Its justified because I keep making the mistakes I shouldnt and I feel stupid alone and nervous all the time. I thought about just trying to smile and improve. Even though my job is tough I thought if I pushed through it would be okay. At the very least my co workers were nice. My supervisor doesnt like me. But Im getting more and more tired. Its like the longer I stay the more my anxiety and depression flares up again. I keep avoiding people for no reason trying to be alone in a workplace where theres tons of people. When people look my way I get so scared of what they are thinking. My hands begin to shake when I do tasks now. Its quite silly because the only reason I am anxious is because of my own incompetence. I just think at this point it would be better if I just leave once my department hires new employees. Tldr Silly rant because Im dumb amp hate my job,Personality-disorder
50974,I feel like I could be an amazing boyfriend but refuse to put myself out there anymore. I 28M have a rep in my friendgroup as being a great guy who refuses to date. In truth I kind of get off on feeling like Im withholding an ability or skill from someone. I enjoy the image of people being jaded that theres no good guys left and that I am present could be an amazing boyfriend but amUniquely against beingacting that way and it making them sad if that makes sense.I grew up in a family very withholding of affection it was very conditional so i think I learned to reverse that in a weird powerplay in a way. I know its not a good thing because I do like the idea of being in a relationship but enjoy the rush of having a skillability to be warm that is kept from the outside world.,Personality-disorder
50976,Discovering this AvPD has been a massive relief. Hoping to spread some positivity.I've spent so long thinking there's something wrong with me and constantly questioning why I can't just find things as easy as everyone else seems to do. Why I can't just be normal? Learning about social anxiety was a help but even then it was like It can't just be that though? and then thinking I must be autistic or have adhd in some regard but never really feeling like I fit into those things.To actually have a name for it and relate to so much of what people post on here it's kind of a relief to know that there's some reason that I'm actually like this and just knowing that this is why. I won't use it as an excuse and I'm going to fight against its tendencies as much as I can but I'm just glad that I finally understand now. I appreciate you all being here. ,Personality-disorder
50977,I'm desperate i don't know how to turn things around I know i should get my shit together but to be honest i am too much of a coward to do so. I thought maybe with age i will try to turn things around out of desperation but despair made things even worse i feel more paralyzed than ever. In fact i wish I had some incurable disease. I want to die...,Personality-disorder
50978,No interest in life Does anyone else have zero interest in life? I'm kind of done but assisted suicide has been delayed another year in Canada. Who knew killing yourself was so difficult . I'm not necessarily sad about dying but life is kind of pointless in my eyes. I'm too much of a coward and squeamish to do it any other way. I wish I could travel and do it abroad but I can't leave at the moment.,Personality-disorder
50979,The Root cause of my AVPD I have spent a lot of time thinking about how I ended up with this disorder. Constantly reviewing and analyzing my past memories trying to find and pinpoint the exact event that caused me to be this way. I wasn't sure I had one and I still think it may be multiple events in my life that led to the development of this disorder. But for me I think the formation of my AVPD has always been interlinked with my sexuality. I am gay and Hispanic. Growing up in a Mexican household parents are not accepting of that whatsoever. Anyways I remember I still remember this time where I was looking up basically dick pics and I didn't delete the search history. I was 13 at the time and was barely discovering porn. My mom checked it before any of us got home and while she was at work later she called my dad and told him about what she found. My dad told me that she was crying because she couldn't accept that her son might be gay. I explained it away to my dad that I was just checking to see how I sized up to other boys my age. But I sorta knew what I was doing. I guess that moment was pretty scary to me. Knowing not even my own parents would accept me. And so I hid myself for a long time. Pretending to be straight year after year. It just got harder every year to put on the mask. And still now at the age of 24 I have never told anyone in my personal life that I'm gay. Not like they don't know it or highly suspect it even though I present myself more masculine. I've never had a girlfriend so I think it's pretty obvious to everyone. But anyways I think it was very much so having to do with moments like I first mentioned. Where I was scared and felt completely alone. I guess it would have changed everything to have someone to tell me it's ok and that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm loved just the same. But I didn't get that. I just learned from an early age that I was different and so I would be treated differently unless I hid it.,Personality-disorder
50980,So.. what now? How do I continue my life. I very recently got diagnosed 4 days ago with AvPD after years and years and years of thinking that I just have very stubborn type of social phobiasocial anxiety. I met with a specialist who really dug through my health records and diagnoses and even read through the psycological evaluation tests I went through over an year ago several times. She was very firm and sure that I indeed have this disorder instead of the one I've been getting treatment on and it all stems from me hard schoollife I had to go through. But instead my home life was always good very loving and caring parents and I love them so so much. They made sure me and my brother always had food clean clothes and a warm home to live in we were poor but still happy.My self esteem and self worth got destroyed from very young age by other kids it's also very hard to trust people I'm worthless and like a ghost to others at times. Without digging deeper to the trauma I've faced in school I've just been existing and surviving from the young age to the 30's. I'm 33 still very broken unemployed depressed too but I go to therapy and have medication. I've medicated myself with alcohol earlier years but stopped when I started antidepressants I still do self harm too as a coping mechanism which I'm not proud at all. I very much hate and regret that I ever started dabbling to that habit in my young days. Is there really something good about this personality disorders Can I ever learn to live with it in the way it won't make me isolate myself from others and fear other people? I don't know. I have a lot of doubts even when I am in a treatment and path to somekind of recovery. Is it even possible to meet new people and form a romantic relationship too? Yes I'm single been for the last 10 years and sometimes it's eating me from the inside to the point I feel physical pain. I crave human touch nonsexual and sexual and sometimes I'm at the point that even a single friendly hug would make me cry. Yes I am lonely. Luckily I have a small friend group very small and two closest people out of this group are a couple so naturally they don't always have time for friends. Which I naturally understand they have their own things and struggles too. It's just life. When I told two other friends about this new diagnosis I got they do know about my mental health struggles well... they just were very silent and one of them answered with 23 words in the way of oh I see and that's all. It did kinda hurt does that make me a badattention seeking person? For wanting even just a little bit of undersanding what's causing me to behave some way I don't always even realise I'm doing it?Heck this is kinda one messy message but I just have so many things going in my head now and I don't have any answers to give for myself. I've always wanted to solve problems by myself but this is just too big of a thing for my brain to fully understand. And I almost deleted this text and didn't want to post. I'm sorry if I sound all whiny I just have so many questions and I'm sure there could be even more of them. I'm not even sure if the flair is correct.,Personality-disorder
50981,It's easy to say that everyone has worth. If I say that I am a worthless subhuman most people will react by saying something like everyone has intrinsic value and that you don't need society or other people to validate your existence. And while it may be theoretically true it's also easy and generic.What is difficult is to feel that you actually have value when such a big part of your life has passed without anyone seeing that value in you. I'm not a bad person but frankly I'm barely a person. I'm unable to do the majority of things most people do. I lack any semblance of personality. People forget about me and that's totally reasonable. Everyone likes me but not really. No one cares about me or is really interested in me.I have acquired major schizoid traits throughout the years to the point that sometimes I'm not sure if I need human connection anymore. But I find myself craving external validation. If there's no one there to believe that you matter do you really? The obvious answer is yes but I'm not so sure anymore.,Personality-disorder
50982,Do others know about your situation? None of my family knows that Im lonely and struggle talking to people. They do ask me how Ive been and how university is going but I always insist things are going fine and that Ive made friends. I wish it didnt come to me lying to them but I guess thats better than them being worried sick at the reality of the way I am.,Personality-disorder
50983,There isn't a day that passed where i wish I didn't die sooner 27M my life so far is a huge disappointment i have so many regrets wasted my youth got no job now no friends a virgin with erectile dysfunction due to meds. i dunno what am I doing being alive at this point. I knew few people who had their lives together but deaths took em outta nowhere i feel I should be the one dead that would have been a huge relief.,Personality-disorder
50984,I think being lonely and isolated caused me to become self centered and almost and still might cost me the best relationship Ive ever had I saw some article about how being lonely and isolated can increase selfcentered thoughts and behaviors. I didnt realize I had this problem until recently. I feel so awful about myself right now. I didnt know it was such an issue until my partner wanted to leave me for it and he still might. I wouldnt blame him. Has anyone else had this come up?,Personality-disorder
50985,My brain just goes blank even if I want to engage I don't know if this is an AvPD thing or not but does anybody else here mostly don't speak as much during conversations because your brain just goes completely blank? I frequently find myself at conversations most of them tbh where I want to talk and engage but I just don't know what to respond at all. I catch myself saying a lot of mmm yeah it's true I agree but not something... substancial you know? Sometimes I even repeat words just to use more time like yeah yeah.Meanwhile when I observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going and it seems so natural for them. I always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than I can and honestly I think this has been proven true over time.Some time ago I created a personal system to help me fill up silences and some of the things I set myself to do at these moments where 1. just think out loud without filtering so much I read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes think with their mouths while introverts think first then decide if it's worth sharing and for us with AvPD andor SAD we mostly decide it is not and 2. look for a subject connection even if it's minimal then be like this reminds me of... and keep going about it.When I observe other people interacting I can see them using these a lot naturally I feel like a robot because I had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice but even with this system I'm still having problems because like I said a lot of times I simply can't think of anything. I don't know if this is some kind of freeze response to the danger of socialization or if my brain is just socially dumb lol.,Personality-disorder
50986,Alcohol Is anyone else just a total fucking mess when they get drunk. Like it starts out fine and fun and the more you drink you just turn into a loud mean annoying over confident horrible person?,Personality-disorder
50987,Hey AvPD folks I could use some advice or perspectives Im in love with someone wAvPD due to my Pattern of getting attracted to emotionally unavailable People.which made me commonly feel unrecognizedunvalued in past relationshipsHowever I want to tell you people that there are a lot of different ways people show love and can feel loved and it varies from Person to Person.Now I need advice from you folks Ive confessed to my Person. The response to it was idk if I feel the same I need to look within but its kind of blurry.We were cuddling so I see it as a indicator but I feel that its difficult. Im scared of coming too strong there but not setting frames around it makes me also feel insecure.Should I try to look at it like a plain opportunity for my Person with AvPD to the experience of cuddling ?Because I know you folks may have trouble forming trust within possible romantic relationships and that It may take a lot longer.How ever forming a relationship out of it would take a lot effort and patience and willingness equally of both.At the bottom line transparent communication is always necessary I think wish me and your AvPD comrade luck.,Personality-disorder
50988,being pretty isnt always what it seems I dont mean to sound conceited or anything but being pretty isnt all its cut out for. I know Im perceived by others as being conventionally attractive but sometimes I feel like it isolates me even more. Theres nothing but a void inside this empty shell of a person but nobody ever thinks I would feel this way because of the way I look. Nobody thinks that someone like me could hate themselves so deeply nobody thinks someone like me would need help or be this fucked up. People probably think Im a bitch in real life when they try to talk to me but I genuinely just dont know how to respond or have a genuine conversation. The answers I do give are bland and the words that come out of my mouth arent the ones I actually wanted to say. I probably come off as rude or disinterested when I dont mean to and it pushes people away because they think Im stuck up or think Im better than them. I feel like a doll trying her best to mimic the people around her. Something people like to look at sometimes but then inevitably get bored with and cast aside.Anyways sorry if this seems like Im vying for attention with this but I just wanted to give a different perspective. Lonely pretty girls are more common than you think.,Personality-disorder

50991,I refuse to flirt it feels so silly. I 28M am not a romantic affectionate person by any stretch of the words. Im definitely cold and aloof at least outwardly especially around women I actually like and am attracted to.So flirting just feels like I have to put on a super uncomfortable act pretend to be someone Im not. I dont like it or want to do it. Although I havent experienced a romantic relationship yet I like the idea of it I just cant stand the process enough to make it worth it.Idk if anyone else has felt this way or has any advice? Or could relate?,Personality-disorder

50994,Being Burned When Reaching Out I want to know if any of you have had this experience.Ever since I was a child a pattern has been that I am verbally offered support and love but when it matters and when I reach out for it it would be rescinded. As a kid I blamed myself and turned inward. As an adult if I fall for an insincere invite for connection or help I feel humiliated and angry with them and myself. I realize this has made me extra sensitive and I even expect to be rejected. It is extremely hard now to ask for help. When someone burns me I dont think I will ever trust them againhard stop. When someone comes through I feel completely overwhelmed with gratitude. Im not even sure of the word for the emotion of that. Im crying as I write this. I think my expectations are too black and white but I dont know how to be change other than to keep giving people chances.,Personality-disorder
50995,Has tough love ever worked on any of you? My family is a very tough love type of family. As far back as I can remember my parents and sister have tried to get me to change my bad wayshabits through tough love but all the problems they would try to use it for are still with me so it clearly has never worked. Just as an example of what I mean my dad would give me tough love in the form of telling me no one would ever want to be my friend or hire me if I continued to be a fat slob true. And the other week my sister came over to the apartment and told me that I wasn't being cute or quirky by almost never cleaning I'm an adult and need to start acting like one it is extremely embarrassing at this point etc also true. But even though I know these things are true hearing people phrase it like hard truths I'm just too dense to grasp doesn't make me want to change for the better. It makes me want to go home put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger because to my family I come off as such a complete moron that they need to tell me obvious shit I already know.I am wondering if this type of tough love is actually helpful for anyone especially people with avpd because in my experience hearing people judge me like that just drives me to start spiraling down. It's like it really does solidify the fact that I am so worthless compared to actual human beings that they always have to talk down to me and my relationship with others always has to be me getting scolded even well into my adult years. But everyone keeps touting tough love as if it's some magic cureall that will make someone instantly snap out of whatever undesireable thing they're doing.,Personality-disorder
50996,Any older people with AvPD there? How does it evolve with age? I honestly feel despair when thinking about the future because deep down I know it's not going to get better. But I'd like to hear experiences from actually older people older as 40 but even 30 may feel usefulPlus anyone recovered? Is it even truly possible to fully recover?,Personality-disorder
50997,Recovered but it's too late I suffered from severe AVPD from my late teens into my early twenties. During this time I cut off my old school friends and then didn't go to uni. In fact I pretty much became a recluse. I eventually started to recover when I was about 22. I'm now in my late twenties and though I feel I've overcome most AVPD symptoms I feel like I am too old to make new friends. I've managed to sort of reconnect with 2 school friends but there was a five year gap in communication so things feel different. I really feel like I would've made my lifelong friends at uni but I didn't make it there. I don't know how to accept the damage that isolating myself during those critical years has done. As I've recovered from AVPD I've realised I'm not that weird of a person and I can actually get on with people fine. But those friend making opportunities of school and uni have long passed. It now feels like no matter how sociable or cool or fun I am it doesn't matter because everyone already has established friends from school or uni and doesn't want anymore. Has anyone else experienced this? Recovered but just too late the damage is done?,Personality-disorder
50998,I'm in CRISIS because how AvPD can potentially influence my desicion for a new major I left college because I wasn't passionate about what I studied and because how much stress I felt of not being socially competent to fulfill a social focused related major.And I'm here again I don't have much time too choose a major and to go back to college my parents have told me this is my last opportunity and limit time but I'm not sure if they would actually follow this through. I don't think they would but I could be wrong. All my interests and passions are related to social things social justice oppressed populations people's potential. I have a big desire to help people and I'm interested in social causes and. On my very top are things like social work sociology and lawBut I'm very afraid of the challenging aspects of my personality and how contrary are to the abilities I need to have for these fields. I don't want to be an incompetent professional because of my characteristics and disorder. I'm extremely afraid of having to leave college again or not being able to succeed.And I know that there are different ways to work in these fields. not necesarilly having the most direct contact with people. But I want to have direct contact too. I had an experience in my previous major where I interviewed a person in treatment process after they finished their sentence. And I felt so passionate while doing it and I liked so much interviewing him analyzing their protective and risk factors to later make a treatment plan closest experience to social workI also worry that if I go to therapy and solve these issues maybe I will end up realizing that I can't stand naturally and in a healthy way working for long periods of time with peopleWhy is that I'm not naturally inclined or interested to paths with way less focus on people TT,Personality-disorder
50999,Is getting diagnosed with AvPD worth it? So correct me if Im wrong about any of what Im about to say. I noticed that the treatment for AvPD is cbt which would be pretty much the standard treatment for a lot of mental health problems. So is it worth going through the process of being diagnosed with AvPD when you could just be diagnosed with something like say anxiety and still get the same treatment options? Again if Im wrong dont hesitate to correct me. Thanks and have a great day.,Personality-disorder

51001,Is it just me? or trying to make a friend with someone who has a lot of other friends making me feel bad about myself Like I won't be accepted as their other friends like this person has a lot of other friends too and I'm totally replaceable so I start to panic and then try to end the friendship quickly like not intending to ruin it I just feel I won't be accepted I feel new I feel like I don't belong anywhere.. Like sometimes I feel I need someone who is just like me with no friends and totally weird in social world .. idk it's just the thought of talking to someone who is more like.. extroverted to other people making me feel sick like so fucking sick Like why and how do you talk to people? How did you even find this amount of supportive loving friends who accepted you? why that isn't me?.. I'm just so hurt that I dealt with since I was literally a child.. I hate myself so muchI have been diagnosed with AvPD last month and I didn't know what was it I think I have it combined with Anxiety and Depression and CPTSD as well.. I think I'm sure of this since my psychiatrist said that.Idk anymore what to do with my life.. I want friends who are like me and.. well.. LIKE me Idk anymore.,Personality-disorder
51002,Severe anxiety phone addiction and clinginess I am slightly shaking as I'm writing this. I hope this post isn't all over the place.ampx200BI have tried everything to combat my phone addiction from productivity apps to uninstalling social media and reinstalling them again etc. I gave up on school despite having been a very bright kid who skipped middle school grades as an immigrant to a new country but now I'm an extremely miserable and depressed 19 year old girl with absolutely no life and with severe anxiety. I keep my mind occupied by scrolling endlessly on my phone. My goto coping mechanism used to be daydreaming but now even daydreaming costs too much energy and the content of the dreams are almost involuntary and disturbing so now I dissociate differently through scrolling endlessly and losing track of time as well as my surroundings for 10 hours a day. Now my heart is beating hard and I'm feeling extra anxious and panicky all because I turned off my phone. I tried to get away from my laptop too but here I am writing this. I have pretty noticeable chest pain as a reaction of trying to avoid numbing my brain scrolling on tiktok. I feel pathetic. Currently I am having a really bad time. I feel left out and abandoned. My only friend and boyfriend who's the most wonderful human being is out with his friends. I'm happy for him but we haven't been able to call or play together for a week and even though I am an adult I am not in a place where I can just go hang out with him. I kept my relationship with him a secret from my parent who I live with to keep the peace and to not destroy the heart of my exceptionally kind loving and sacrificial mother who happens to be religious. My other siblings and I have disappointed her enough especially me her once very happy intelligent bright and ambitious baby. She knows I don't have friends or a job or any activities for that matter. I almost never leave the house except for going to my therapy sessions. So coming up with excuses to see my boyfriend has also been a huge challange. He has done his absolute best during our relationship. He is the most caring compassionate and nurturing partner of all time. He is my best friend a person I can be playful and comfortable with and I try not to make my AvPD or other mental health stuff effect him. I don't want him to feel guilty having fun with his friends but I am so extremely jealous. He can go out and do whatever he wants and he has friends he can do things with. Even if I'm his priority due to my circumstances I can't even make it all worth is. I'm currently depressed and have nothing fun to talk about or do I can't even find excuses to leave the house. So I'm not blaming him I am blaming myself for all of it. For how I feel for the guilt I feel after realizing how jealous and bitter my feelings are for being so uninteresting and for not doing more to change Trying not to use my phone now all of the sudden may also have to do with the fact that I don't want to stare at my notification the entire time waiting for a text from him. If he doesn't text I feel lonely and left out. If he does text I feel like I will never experience ever going to places and parties with him and I get jealous. I don't let him know these feelings while I'm feeling them. I love this person immensely. He gets worried about me and I don't want his weekend to be ruined by his clingy gf even though when I have breakdowns of any kind he reassures me that I didn't ruin his day and he prioritizes me over other stuff in his day to just either come and be with me we live in different cities or call me until I feel better. I want him to be happy. I have seen the positive impact I had on his life and his impact on mine and I'm scared that my loneliness and clinginess could hurt him or hurt either of us so I try to tone it down as much as I could. I'm tired I miss him so much and I also feel bad for missing him because I find it near impossible to do anything else with my time that he is the only thing left in my life.,Personality-disorder
51003,Emotions are determined by the reactions of others I've lost myself to the point where I feel like there's no meaning to being a part of society. Throughout history human beings have been motivated by goals and aspirations but I feel like I can no longer endure this way of living. The loss of my sense of self has left me feeling adrift and without any direction or purpose.,Personality-disorder
51004,Therapist concerns I want to give this therapist more of a chance and I'm tired of looking. The one I had previously was too casual and kept directing the conversation towards family drama rather than focusing on me. The therapist I have now talks a lot often feeling like a motivational speaker. It seems like a lot of her advice boils down to just do it which isn't always a negative but I'm not looking for simple actions to take which is important but CBT can be extremely disappointing. I'm interested in delving deep into my psyche but she doesn't seem as curious as I'd prefer. She doesn't ask enough questions and seems to assume a lot about me as if my concerns are simply general concerns with general roots behind them. She talks specifically about surface problems but vaguely regarding experiences and the reasons for problems in this life. I know that we all share a lot of the same feelings and experiences but that's not what I'm interested in emphasizing and to be honest it doesn't make me feel better. I already know other people feel similarly to me I already know that but I also know that everyone's experience is different. People go to these pages to feel less alone and it does help slightly but that's not enough. I don't care to hear that I'm normal it just feels minimizing. I want to connect with people but feel utterly incapable of doing so even when I put myself out there and have conversations I feel like I'm not really there talking to them and they're not seeing me. My therapist wouldn't even see the AVPD she thinks I just have depression. I don't know what to do I'm scared to open up to her about my concerns I don't know how I would do that. CBT is helpful in that it gives people practical ways to help themselves and take control of their lives like taking small steps for example. But it's not enough for me.,Personality-disorder
51005,why am i so scared of being seen? i cant tell if its avoidant personality disorder or body dysmorphia or a sick combination of both but i highly suspect i suffer from avpd. it just all makes so much fucking sense too much honestly and it hurts to think that life will always be this painful. i feel like theres nothing i can do about it. ive always said i feel like an alien. that i feel like i experience being a human differently than everyone else is. because if everyone else was hurting as much as me no way theyd be able to keep it to themselves. everyone would be crying all the time. and theyre not. so i must be the weird one. i have these online friends i wanna meet known them for 11 years and they only live a few hours away. theyve expressed interest several times and im just this freak who cant leave the house. the thought of them looking at me terrifies me. theyve seen me through a phone screen but what if in person im too ugly? realistically i know they wouldnt suddenly turn on me and start bullying or anything but the idea that the thought still might pop into their heads something along the lines of oh disappointing or at least i dont look like that its too much. its painful to think about. theres one friend who is pretty special to me. we met as kids through an online game had a little flirtycrushpuppy love thing going on for a while but we grew up and didnt stay as close through the years just checking in here or there but lately they have become one of the most important people ever to me. and those dumb childish feelings started coming back only now i think its evolved into something more and i seriously have been hopelessly pining after them for the past 3 years or so recently they said they liked me. took me COMPLETELY by surprise as i had been trying and failing miserably to get over them. so this should be great news. but nothing can happen now. we just expressed our mutual like and now we flirt a little here and there but they said they dont think they can be in a romantic relationship right now yet they keep initiating all of the flirting and they mentioned how its hard not seeing me because if we could hang out things would be easier. which makes a lot of fucking sense. but this is also all very confusing. im stuck. im terrified. im ugly theyve seen my face and know that im fat but theyve never really SEEN me. not fully. not from every angle. not up close. not in person. im anticipating the rejection the disgust and its too much i wanna hold onto this idea in my head of us living happily ever after. and changing the relationship will probably end in disaster. they said they need my friendship and that theyre scared this could ruin things. im scared too. im scared theyll see me and any feelings of like will fade completely. and if i tell them this im scared it will only speed up the process. they talk about wanting to kiss me and things like that and ive never done anything with anyone. 12 yr old me is freaking out i always hoped they would be my first back then lmao so many firsts i wanna have and im scared it will mean too much to me and not them. how do i express this? do i even try? how the FUCK do i get over this and go see them? i need to see them. i need them. i need i need i need i need help. can anyone talk to me?,Personality-disorder
51006,I have just bailed on a friend for the third weekend in a row I feel pretty bad about it too. Last weekend I had plans I didn't and the weekend before that I actually was sort of going through something. But tonight... I just don't want to see anyone. So I cancelled again.But I am trying to make up for it and I offered to do lunch Sunday he's accepted.I'm unsure if I told him about my disorder and honestly I think he'd not get AvPD anyways. I have had many experiences telling people about AvPD and they just sort of give a wellmeaning but not getting it nod.I have been diagnosed with AvPD for well over a year now and I've been in therapy for even longer so I'm quite good at the whole mindfulness thing. So this year has been all about selfimprovement for me. And I just don't feel ready to go back out into the nightlife. We go to gay bars quite frequently we are both gay. I feel like I'm in my chrysalis as I finally work on myself for the first time like ever. Going out feels like I'm forcing myself to hatch too soon and I just imagine myself as this gooey halfbaked butterfly if I try to go out now. I want to get to my full form to go out and about. And I'm just not there yet.But further going out is a lot of things that could go wrong for me. Where am I going to put my car? Ubers are a lot of money here. What happens if I leave it at his place but I want to go home earlier than him? Etc. etc.Being alone in my apartment is just so peaceful. But it's lonely. And I know if I keep this up when the loneliness becomes too much further on down the road I might not have any friends left to see.,Personality-disorder
51007,At a conference for work and everything is making me want to hide. I am completely struggling. I am feeling a ton of social anxiety and to compound that avpd is on overdrive. desperately want to hide and isolate and just get away from everyone including the few people I actually know here. Just hopefully stubbly ditched my one acquaintance here to go find a spot alone. I feel completely uncomfortable physically and mentally. I have to stay here because I have a networking event my boss is going to and Im a guest of honor so Im required to stay until tonight for but that makes everything even worse because people are bound to come up to me and ask about my work. Shit I hate avpd everyone here is just chatting and enjoying themselves and learning and I am so in my head I can barely process anything.,Personality-disorder

51009,Physical Pain One of the biggest issues I have these days is the pain I get whenever I enter a shame spiral several times daily to varying degrees. I've gotten used to numbing the emotional pain through different techniques but I find that my arms hands and legs ache whenever this happens. I'd describe the pain as similar to the sensation gaining feeling back after being in the cold too long. Does anyone else have this problem and if so do you have any tips for dealing with it?

51016,AvPD got a shout out in The Expendables Kind of a funny bit of trivia I didn't expect to hear AvPD mentioned in a very 'manlyman' action movie like The Expendables but at one point Randy Couture's character mentions he is going to therapy for it lol.

And before well meaning people jump in to say that I can't know that for sure or that there's someone for everyone... please note that it will not make me feel better. Don't undermine my suffering please.People don't fall in love with someone who's a shell of a person unable to function and express themselves. They don't become friends with people like me. But without human connection you are not able to grow up. You are left a forever lonely lost child in a slowly decaying body.There's only so much healing a person without a support system can do on their own. It's excruciating and humiliating constantly feeling like you're worse than everyone around you a cruel parody on a living creature.,Personality-disorder
51018,reconnected with a good friend yesterday it was really nice even though we mainly talked about tea lol and how rough life is i wanted to hear them out and it had been a while since we had connected one on one like thatwe ended up chatting for hours! just between the two of us and it was really nice i had never done that before with anyone except my family and my boyfriend. i think what made it better was how much they understood the hardship of justtalking about problems we both struggle with even talking about ourselves went through some real shit together and finding someone else we could really talk to without fear of anything happening was so relieving. they arent on avpd level like i am but they really get iteven though its still been really hard trying to socialize irl ive felt really good about my progress to reconnect with online friends lately and have real conversations more with them and my bf and its really helped a lot as ive been living alone and felt really lonely as of late especially with the rough time ive had the past few weeks. it was a really nice pickup and it made me realize again how secure i can manage to feel with the right people.,Personality-disorder
51019,Jesus taught avoidance I'm certain I'd be diagnosed with this disorder and many prophets would too.John the Baptist for example lived in the wilderness until he started his ministry. Now that is dedication!There are many verses related to AvPD in the Bible I'll post some at the bottom.I avoid everyone but Jesus because he is infinitely loving and wise and talking to other people is TORTURE in comparison.I've experienced this phenomenon in my life many times and I see it constantly across every facet of life friend groups businesses etcIf a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand. Mark 324It seems that we have realized no matter who or what we come into contact with it's only a matter of time until it falls apart.I would argue this is not a disorder but wisdom.In fact I would encourage everyone to lean into this!Whatever can be shaken let it fall.Jesus Christ is the only solid foundation. He is the only thing valuable enough to unite around.Without Christ it WILL fall apart your new social circle workout plan job hobby... Don't settle for second best. Don't put your faith in a priest pastor friend partner family... Go straight to the source!He's waiting for you to call out.You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. Jeremiah 2913 Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks the door will be opened. Matthew 778AvPDDo not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world love for the Father is not in them. 1 John 215You adulterous people dont you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. James 44If you belonged to the world it would love you as its own.

51021,'chicken or the egg' situation do I treat the physical symptoms panic attacks or the core issue childhood traumafeelings of inadequacy Due to an array of weird circumstances I am a manager. A manager with avoidant personality. A manager who can't even say hi to her coworkers or ask for help. A very necessary skill for a manager. A manager who is visibly pushing down a panic attack each moment choking on words and shaky hands. And you're too scared to ask to step down bc you already done so 3 times..I have no idea whether to tackle the somatic issue my panic attacksnervous system arousal or the core issue which is my feelings of not being worthy. I feel like I am inherently toxic and cold. I never say hi to anyone even though a manager should be approachable and amicable...I will say I focused a bit on healing somaticallythe physical symptoms. At least with somatic healing I don't lock down and go onto a full blown panic attack anymore where I am mute and shut down. I know my limit.I been a manager for a year now. I been avoiding my family my career is falling apart and I have lost all my friends. I need help but I feel like financially it is not possible. I want to be medicated but SSRIs didn't do jack for me. Weed just bites you in the long run. Not sure if meds can ever really heal this. I just want to stop having panic attacks. But i know my core issuesinner monologue ans my unprocessed childhood trauma are what kick me into panic mode everyday. Panic mode makes me mute and silent which peoppe percieve negatively. I go into work and feel inadequate for anyone ever seeing me at my lowest. I avoid them out of fear of ridicule. And the cycle continues,Personality-disorder
51022,I act like a child and idk if it's just me or because of avpd People have commented before on this and what it is is that I basically look up to people in the way a child would look up to an adult and I do this because I admire how other people my age act like real adults and are confident and capable of doing adulty things. I absolutely am not a real adult despite my age.I also tend to want these people to look after me a bit make me feel safe protect me from other people because I view them as competent whilst I'm essentially an over grown child. I suppose this could stem from childhood trauma where I didn't feel protected maybe so I now try to hide behind other people to feel safe. I don't know if anyone else experiences this. I've never seen anyone talk about something like this before so I fear I'm just a complete weirdo . I'm not sure if this is actually a sign I have dependent personality disorder or something instead of being avpd related. Hopefully you guys can let me know if this is avpd related or not.,Personality-disorder
51023,feeling better then worse again i know recovery is never an uphill slope but it still feels like shit when you take steps back. after getting little to no socialization for the past decade ive been really pushing myself to get out there more. ive joined a peer support organization for people with mental illness and ive been going multiple times a week. some days i feel like im making progress by challenging myself to engage in conversation and when it goes well it feels nice. but thats not every time... sometimes like today i feel like i dont belong and shouldnt be there. there were so many people today i just felt invisible and like i didnt matter so there was no point to even trying to make conversation. maybe it was too overwhelming or i had nothing to add to any coversations and yet i still feel like im back at square one. logically i know im not because im still going to keep trying but it just hurts to feel this way. to always feel like youre invisible and shouldnt exist. i dont want to feel like this. i want to have friends so badly its painful to be this lonely. i want to belong. and yet... i still believe i wont. im not giving up. it just sucks personality disorders suck!,Personality-disorder
51024,I think I may have AVPD anyone relate? Ive been in therapy on and off since 2015. Ive been diagnosed with Major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and bulimia. Recently Ive been diagnosed with ADHD too. Though recently Ive been thinking something more is wrong with me. Ive been in therapy and been on meds since 2015 with med increases and it helps but in stressful times or when I forget to take my meds I go back to the same thought patterns. Recently theyve been coming up. What makes me think its AVPD because for the past decade and a half Ive always felt inadequate and not good enough no matter what I do. Its rare for me to think Im good at something but even then I feel like Im bragging and being obtuse or being narcissistic. Objectively Ive had success Ive been to a reputable college and for grad school I went to an Ivy League school but I feel like its a fluke. I constantly feel like a nuisance and a burden. I regret and am critical with most of my reactions with other people and assume everyone is tired of me or thinks Im annoying even though no one says anything or gives me one statement like whats up with all the talking.I dont like to be the first one to call someone a friend because I want to make sure they feel like they are my friend. I dont want to impose myself on them and I assume they dont want to be my friend. Even some of my friends now I get into episodes where I assume they dont like me but because theyre nice they tolerate me. I dont like to reach out to them first because I dont want to bother them. I dont follow up with friendships because I dont want to bother anyone. Theres people that I loved to spend time with and liked them as a human but I dont want to bother them at all so I avoid. I dont really date. Ive had dating apps but I can only use them if I pay for the parts that lets me see who likes me first and then I go from there. Regarding jobsworking initially I would take the first job offer I got because they wanted me because I would assume Im not good enough for any other place. I tend to be the person since high school to primarily only speak until Im spoken to or is asked to speak otherwise I stay quiet. I only have a handful of friends that Ive known for at least a decade that I ask to hang out but otherwise I usually dont initiate conversations or social events. If I do it with high anxiety and expectation of rejection. Criticism is also detrimental to me. Ive gotten better at it in the past year or so but it still just debilitates me. I feel like a failure and want to run away when I get criticism. So basically because Ive been like this since high school currently 30 Im thinking I have AVPD. My job is social and interactive with people which makes it seem like I dont have it but my impostor syndrome is so high unless I get verbal confirmation from others that Im doing good. with everything else I assume Im a bad person and I need to isolate andor disappear with family and friends and coworkers. Does anyone else relate? I have a therapist and Im going to bring this up. TLDRI think I have AVPD because of my baseline fear of rejection criticism wanting to have close friends but feeling inadequate andor like a bad person and I dont want to initiate friendships or relationships unless they confirm they want to be my friend andor like me.EDIT I think Im looking for anyone who thinks this might be AvPD andor validation? Idk,Personality-disorder
51025,I saw someone I barely know sneakily taking a pic of me while in auditorium I'm currently in uni not doing well and today I decided to show up to a lecture a girl from my dorm who takes the same classes as me sat in front of me. I saw her subtly taking a pic where I was in the background and circle my face out on it to put the attention on me in Snapchat. I have been avoiding all dorm activities and I know everyone else have become a tight group of friends while I have been too scared to go out there and get out of my dorm room to interact with anyone for the entire semester. When I think about it it makes perfect sense that people find me weird and make fun of me. It's being the odd one out the asocial guy who doesn't show his face. I mean I don't even know the names of the people in my hallway. I can understand why they would talk about my strangness or see me as weird even be kind of disgusted by me. I am extremely akward I lack social skills I am anxious and get panic attacks emotional flashbacks when around people. I have no healthy boundaries and do not know who I am as a person have no consistent sense of self. To cope with all this I avoid all situations in which people could reject me or shame me for my insecurities lack of social skills etc. By avoiding situations I am trying to avoid getting rejected or ridiculed and deep down I know it's only normal to be frowned upon for being different or weird think about the fact that you can't help but look at someone who walks weird because of arthritis or when you come accros a homeless man lying on the side of the street. Your attention either gets caught or you try to consciously ignore it.Somehow I was still somewhat believing that I could fool the people in my dorm and hope they won't think of me as flawed insecure weird antisocial a loner etc. After seeing that I am indeed most likely a subject of ridicule mockery disgust etc to the people in my dorm I can fully drop my delusion.I have CPTSD and I developped my avoidance because of childhood emotional neglectabandonment and abuse by my narc mother. My brain is wired differently than the average person with healthy and good enough parents. I didn't have secure attachments in childhood and I am for that reason developmentally arrested. The people in my dorm don't know me and don't know about my trauma or CPTSD. They are doing what humans do pointing out the weirdness the odd one out the undesirable. It triggers people when they are confronted by something they don't understand or find weird it's normal they have their own insecurities and issues and can project all of that on the black sheep on the odd one out. If I had healthy parents good enough social skills and a fully developped and trauma free brain I would probably do the same when I encountered a weird person heck I even have judged many people for being strange undesirable or weird myself and thought I was superior to them.,Personality-disorder
51027,how many people here have social anxiety as well? I keep forgetting that some of my vent posts are actually more to do with social anxiety than avpd at least it seems to be that way because people in here don't seem to relate to some of my posts so I guess it's more to do with social anxiety than avpd.

51030,I was triggered while talking to an old school friend and crashed the interaction This happened 9 month ago.I M50 was being approached by a woman that was in the same class in school with me some 30 years ago. I was just loading groceries into my car when she drove past behind me and said loudly oh hey that's a familiar face... . I turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see her... we started to talk she said she has seen me in this supermarket before. We exchanged some small talk... what do you do where do you live do you still have contact with the people of the past... this kind of stuff. I already was kind of nervous because of the small talk situation but when the topic of the other people from the past came up i began to panic. The thing is that i was being bullied for the 5 years that I was in this class. Not from her she was always nice.But the time in this class left it's marks and I didn't want to have anything to do with the people from these circles after I was done there.So at the end of our talk she asked if we should exchange numbers... and i froze. There were just so many thoughts in my head but i couldn't say any of them because none of these were appropriate for a casual conversation after 30 years.A small part of me was flattered that she remembered me and cared to approach me.But all the other parts of my brain were actively persuading me why this was not a good ideawhen i exchange numbers i will have to be prepared for her to calltext anytime i don't like this.i clearly still have a problem with the old times and the people from the past.when i calltext with her then i will have to explain this sooner or later or just lie and pretend that these things did not affect me.this is not the kind of topic that i can casually bring up after 30 years so i can't explain this and don't think that i can lie either...besides if i exchange numbers then i will have to well talk... text... ask questions... like a normal person and since i live very isolated i kind of forgot how to do this.and what do i do if she wants to get a coffee... or meet others... it's better to just end this here now and not exchange numbers.but i can't say that i don't want to exchange numbers who does something like this? i would have to explain this.I was spiraling...I'm not sure how long i stood there saying nothing. I guess she could tell from my face that there was a problem.Then she said you don't have to say anything.I think I mumbled something like okay and it was really nice meeting you and we parted.I should have just exchanged the number and go from there.I really would have liked to be able to do this but i couldn't.I regret this now and i am constantly thinking if i should contact her I know her address but of course not her phone number so i would have to write a letter i guess and try to explain things.At least tell her that it really was nice seeing her and that my reaction or lack thereof was not because of her but had other personal reasons.But of course everything is much more awkward now than if i would just have exchanged the number...,Personality-disorder

51035,Feel like a piece of shit I 23F dont know how to explain myself to the people closest to me. When they look at me they see potential and they figure I should be more independent. I graduated college in December and my family although they wont say it to my face expected me to land an impressive stable job right out of college but they didnt realize and I know this is mostly my fault because I never really opened up to them about it that my avoidance got progressively worse as I went through college. I never made any friends. Not one. Always too self conscious and awkward. I dont talk to anybody I met in college. I was even on the volleyball team and never got close to any of my teammates over the four whole years. Only kept it amicable and surface level. Always to scared to open up. I grew progressively more lonely as the years went on. I felt a lot of shame about my lack of social life and made sure to never really bring it up around family when I would see them over break. I figured all that mattered was that I get good grades and work hard in volleyball. Besides my social anxiety and depression would be so overwhelming most days the only thing I felt like I had the energy for was school and sports. I was constantly overwhelmed and didnt have the energy desire or confidence to be social. The worst part was hiding this part of myself from family. Always feeling like Im constantly hiding. I basically just went through the motions in college but thats honestly all I had the energy for. It felt impossible to dream up a future a career because I was just trying to get by each day. I would always and still do feel guilty for wasting my time in college. For passing up dozens of opportunities that were right in front of me because of my avoidance and fear. So its been three months now that Ive graduated and I still dont know what Im doing with my bachelors degree. I know Im letting my family down.Ive been living in my mom and stepdads house since Ive been out of college and I only recently got a job at a cafe and everyone seems to think Im selling myself short doing the bare minimum. The thing is this job was basically handed to me because my mom is one of the managers and they were desperate for people. I only just started this job and dealing with the customers has been hell. But I thought this would be a good way to finally step out of my comfort zone. Even if Im not using my degree yet at least Im earning my own money right? Wrong. It doesnt feel like enough. I suppose I feel pressure to live up to other peoples expectations of me. But I also honestly know I should be doing more. I should have a license a social life an exciting job more independencebut theres something wrong with me something missing. I know I should have more compassion for myself but thats really hard in the position I find myself in. Im honestly more frustrated with myself than anything. I feel intense shame about my lack of social skills and general fear of people. This simple cafe job even feels like too much for me because of all the interacting with customers which only fills me with more shame and frustration. If I cant handle this job then what can I handle? I feel stuck and hopeless. I think I might be looking into a therapist so theres that. Sorry for making this so long.,Personality-disorder

51037,Just a warning. But don't stop taking your meds. Hello just want to share my experience. Please watch out with using meds long term. Especially benzos. If you need meds you need meds. No doubts. But most meds don't heal. They're a temporary solution. I compare benzos to alcohol.. Very effective for anxiety. Strange comparison? No they both make things worse in the long term. A benzo addiction is one of the worst addictions you can have. My psychiatrist putted me on them for 5 years daily. In didn't knew better 15 years ago. No internet... Very irresponsible from him. The withdrawals are insane. I never experienced something like that. Even more harsh compared to hard drugs wellbenzos are a hard drug. And I did a lot of drugs in the past. I learned from it. 15 years ago I said for every problem there's a pill. Can you imagine that? I was delusional and unaware. There's not a magic pill or drug. Sorry I have to say this. Maybe I'm saying well known things. But use benzos with caution. 4 weeks at max... Or 2 times a week. Otherwise you're in for a very unpleasant surprise that can ruin your life.But yeah... I'm not a doc...and don't stop taking your meds cause you're reading this. Talk about it with a professional. Ask advice. Do research about the meds you're taking. Meds can help a lot. But not long term. Long term a big no go.,Personality-disorder
51038,My first post on any social media ever My only purpose of writing this is probably just to vent. I don't even know if this is a right sub for me to post on because I don't have any diagnosis but I feel I can relate to most things described here. I'm 23 years old and basically I feel like a defective human specimen. I'm scared of everything every task or opportunity seems impossible to achieve. Even when I'm writing this I can almost feel physical pain. I can't communicate with people and feel inferior to basically everyone and unworthy of anything. The feeling of powerlessness and inability to change this is unbearable. I don't know why I decided to write all of this and what to expect but here it is.Wishing a good day for anyone that might somehow read this post.,Personality-disorder
51039,Do people get upset at you because you used to talk to them a lot then you stop talking to them? I talk to a lot of people sometimes then I get really exhausted and cant keep up. Then I dont want to talk to many people anymore. The people I end up not talking to anymore some get really upset at me for not talking to me anymore but they dont tell me so how am I supposed to know?,Personality-disorder
51040,Noticing negative behaviours while talking to someone I quickly notice negative behaviours when i talk to people. I feel like their sound changes they roll their eyes etc. So i stop talking to them immediately. And when i notice it ruins my day. It is one of the things that makes me avoid most of the social interactions. Can you guys relate?,Personality-disorder
51042,I really need to go to the pharmacy please someone to encourage me help me.. it's going to get worse if I don't go it's been more than a week already.I hate that I'm neglecting and selfisolating myself so badly because of my issues I hate it so much. I'm so lonely the only motivation I have is from myself and needless to say there's literally noneincidentally I have to see a doctor a dentist an orthodontist and an endocrinologist and it's so so so hard to get myself to do it oh god I'm like slowly decaying,Personality-disorder
51044,I am really truly screwed this time My parents have decided to stop paying for my food in the middle of a catatonic depression. Im scared for myself. I woke up today finally having had enough with starving. I was on my way to the store for the first time in a month Ive only been running low about a week tho when I got this text from my dad Do not spend any money at all this week. Rent is coming out and there is ONLY enough in there for the payment. Unfortunately you have gone through the remainder of the borrowed money from the loans I took out. And you didnt get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late. You will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account.Im backed so far into a corner. I am just defeated. I have no food left I have no money and I cant bear the judgement. It feels like Ive already lost everything now theyve even taken my food? I cant do anything about it in this mental state. They dont even know Ive already failed out of my semester and cant leave my apartment. And my parents are insane. Legitimately delusional and abusive human beings. I mean Im crazy but these folks? Who starves their mentally ill son because theres not enough money and then flies to Vegas for the weekend for a vacation? I hate myself but even I dont deserve this. The isolation judgement and control I live under is unimaginable. Theres nothing metaphorical about it it is torture.Edit Im doing alright got some help from a friend for this week. Looking into my options.,Personality-disorder
51045,Expecting too much from friends? If people I care about dont make it extremely evident to me that they also actually care about me then I feel unsafe amp I just want to ghost them but I also really cant tell where the line between me needing too much reassurance is vs them genuinely showing me that theyre not that interested. I dont really believe that anyone would want to be around me or understand why they would which also clouds my view. I feel like having friends is so painful for me because Im always feeling like they dont want me around amp not knowing if I should just completely stop talking to them if we havent talked a lot lately or if any aspect of our dynamic shifts. Its actually easier amp less painful to ignore being lonely than it is to be confronted with constantly feeling inadequate amp unwanted. I needed to vent about this but I also want to ask if these feelings have lessened for anyone over time? If its just going to be this uncomfortable forever then I actually dont think its worth it.,Personality-disorder

51047,Feeling worthless in my relationship because my partner's tone sounds dismissive at times? I get feelings of worthlessness as soon as the infatuation fades even by a fraction.It's fucking brutal I can't fucking live wondering when is my partner gonna get bored with me and see me as plain as I see myself all the goddamn time. I sometimes get this idea of asking normal people how insecure they are in a relationship and measure that and compare it to how insecure I am. The difference in results is probably gonna be crazy. Is it normal with this disorders or I'm even worse than regular people with avpd? This is gonna drive me crazy one day I already feel myself wanting to leave,Personality-disorder
51048,small victories Ive been secretly struggling with avpd for years I couldnt even tell you when it began. What I do know is it started out as severe social anxiety and has gotten progressively worse as times passed. I have panic attackstrouble sleeping nearly every day and feel like Im incapable of doing anything 99 of the time. Ive never told anyone about my struggles. Today I started online college and signed up for betterhelp therapy through my school. Im absolutely terrified for this journey but Im proud of myself for pushing myself to get here. As someone whos struggled to commit to a careerobligations and take initiative with anything this is huge for me. I never thought I could get to this point and I still have to follow through with everything Ive committed to lol but Im wishing you all the best and encourage you to celebrate your little victories everyday.,Personality-disorder

51051,How often do you avoid reading DMs out of fear of what they might say? I just went a week without reading a DM I got after hanging out last week cause I felt they might not want to hand out again. The message actually said Hey was fun hanging out happy to hear from you again,Personality-disorder
51052,I can't trust my own judgement When it comes to dealing with people from family to coworkers I go completely blank and my brain just shuts off. Like my brain is like oh you have to talk someone count me out. Afterwards I can draw a million reasons why the way someone behaved mostly negative and I have no objective insight into how the person received the interaction. I'm honestly lost so to not be a burden and not become depressed I'm just going to isolate. It's easier safer and more peaceful. I have no conviction that I'm able to socialize.,Personality-disorder
51053,I am so damn scared of my therapist I heard avoidants are reluctant to seek therapy...Well in 2021 I had a very hard time struggling with my mental health I have ocd. I scheduled therapy 3 times with 3 different therapists and unscheduled it before every appointment because I couldn't gather the courage to go I could not stand the fear of being judged and exposing my vulnerability like that I felt so ashamed I wanted to vanish.Anyway... currently I am on meds for my ocd because I finally managed to go to a psychiatrist. However I don't wanna be on meds forever so I started therapy too.It has been 3 sessions so far and I am seriously considering leaving. Although I see how this can be helpful I cannot stand the shame it brings me to talk about myself like that. It doesn't matter how many times the therapist says he won't judge me and understands me. My brain tells me that is absolutely impossible.To make it worse I cried last time on therapy because I was talking about some very personal struggles. This made me even more ashamed.The therapist lives near my house and as fucked up as that sounds I am so scared to walk near the place where he lives and cross him on the street it happened once..... yesterday I was there and felt as if I was gonna faint not exaggerating. The shame is unbelievable.My next session is on Friday... today is Wednesday... oh dear God I can't believe I am paying to feel like this. I can't even tell if his approach is the problem or if it is just my avoidance. Honestly I think I'd feel like this with any therapist.,Personality-disorder

51055,I'm too patient with my parents for their own good She doesn't deserve to ask for a hug and especially not in the right to pretty much force it on me while she says she's just stressed after yelling in my face because I made a minor mistake. Then complains about how neither me nor my dad give her affection. If she and I can agree the man she married is horrible then she should be able to look in the mirror and recognize what she sees too but no coz she's better than him. I'm only ever patient with her and when she happens to see what i did isn't to perfection I'm just degraded in the angriest and loudest manner possible and reminded for how i keep making mistakes. Then there's my dad who is an emotionally and verbally abusive misogynistic narcissist whom i just tolerate because anytime i say something I'm deemed too young to know anything or too serious.Even though I silenty seeth with anger everytime they put me down everytime that anger and resentment fades away I still go back to craving the love I want from them and loving them the ways I know I can that they will accept. They're very fortunate to have as good of a daughter as I am and they don't even realize it. Why do I have to live with this repeated mistreatment for being human ,Personality-disorder

51059,Ghosting a client and stressing myself out daily Hello. So I woke up stressed again and thought I should really open up here because maybe others are going through something similar. Long story short Ive had such a hard time with finding and keeping work and part of it is because I have difficulty communicating especially when things done go as planned. Ive gotten so behind on a project that I feel frozen. The days and weeks just keep passing by and I keep avoiding talking to the client about the true status and stress keeps growing. Im afraid to even check my emails most days. I know what I need to do and I know I need to talk to the client so that I can move forward and also so that I can get paid but I really feel frozen with shame and avoidance and stress. Frozen is the best word to describe it. I hate these feelings.,Personality-disorder
51060,I really miss having friends I think about old friends every single day always reminiscing about the good old days where I used to have people that liked me and I used to laugh a lot and make memories I've never since forgotten. I regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends I haven't spoken to in over a decade making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore. The only times I've ever been truly happy was just being one of the guys where I was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason I couldn't quite understand. And I just pushed everyone away assuming they all secretly hated me with absolutely evidence to support that claim. Then I spend the rest of my life thinking about them every day hoping some day they might still think of me and reach out cause I definitely am not the one to do it first. I haven't had a friend in years now and my life feels so empty without them they really do fill a massive gap in my life. Feeling wanted and liked by others is the best thing I've ever felt but it never lasts long before they see how really odd I am and a distance starts forming.Anyway sorry for the rant just having one of those days that even though it's exactly the same as every other day it also just feels worse for some unknown reason.,Personality-disorder
51061,harmless situations cause embarrassment and shame i dont understand why such minor situations cause me so much embarrassment and shame. i just asked to sign up for something and i was told i cant until tomorrow and now im hating myself and wishing id never leave my house or socialize. thats something that would mean nothing to other people and yet it makes me feel nauseous. i really hope these symptoms can get better because i dont know how i could live the rest of my life this way. im tired of feeling constant shame and embarrassment when im in public and within social situations that leave me feeling suicidal when its never a big deal to anyone else. i hate how sensitive i am especially to silly things. does anyone else feel this way?,Personality-disorder

51064,Narcissistic mom uses family pet as a weapon I don't live with my her anymore so she has less power but she likes to use my bond with the family dog as a weapon. My vulnerable narcisstic brother over 30yo ''pretends'' not to like the dog he doesn't actually hurt the dog but he pretends not to like it and the dog can sense it and feels confused. He moves between this and making a joke about it in front of others to cover himself that it is just purely an act. For example i know he will have some pictures taken with the dog showing that he likes the dog so if anything were to happen he would play victim. yet he will keep them hiddenMy nmon knows my brother does this out of insecurity towards me and she plays to it when I speak to her on the phone she will bring my brother into the conversation even when I was not talking about him she pretends to mishear that id asked him a question just so he can say something like''' im just busy punching the dog' then my nmom gleefully says back to me he says he's says he is punching the dog and she does this to make sure I say something back so they get the reaction their looking for even though she knows I can hear perfectly well what he said. I dont take the bait but says something to move the conversation along like'' sounds pretty lame''.They do this routine all the time in different ways and my nbrother has even started a new one where he jokes about getting ready for his fight with me and my nmon plays to this aswell encouraging the imaginary conflict and trying to bait me into saying something back that escalates the situation. Of course again if anything were too happen I would be blamed regardless of the outcome cause it's all just a joke after all. Making vague threats of violence and beng lowkey mean to the dog.My nmon has done this in the past with her ex bf she would vaguely threaten me with him and she would encourage them to ''step up'' and argue with me when they didn't really want too. That led to a fight one time with her bf confronted my youngest brother and cornered him in the bathroom He came out crying and said he got punched which led me to react and a fight. my bro lied he was just scared. I ended up getting arrested and blamed for the whole situation the bf holds deep grudge against me because the trauma so I have to avoid certain family gatherings where he is there. Even though my nmom orchestrates the whole thing.Just wanted someone to share this with as its quite depressing,Personality-disorder
51065,Feeling guilt. I've had the perfect childhood all the opportunities great parents a lot of friends that even now 30 years later are my friends. My parents supported me in everything my mom is the best.Then I got meningitis and everything changed. I was never the same again. Started doing drugs to cope with my emotions yes weed is still an addictive drug partying all weekends with my friends. Xtc was just a normal thing when going to techno parties. It's the love drug... You feel so connected with others on xtc. Everyone was on xtc. Got addicted to weed for 20 years. Luckily I quitted with that 3 years ago.My mom was always worried about me. Now she's 73 years old and still worrying about me. It's my task now taking care of them. But I can't. My dad is dementing. When visiting them I use kratomlegal. I feel normal and happy then. Me happymy mom happy. But it's masking. Not the real me. If my mom sees me happy and positive... And yes... I notice that directly...if my parents are happy and not worrying... I feel better I don't want them to worry. I just want her to be proud she says it doesn't matter. I am who I am and she will always be proud of me. But... I see the difference i can read and feel emotions from others very good.... More a curse than a blessing. Sometimes I can't clean my house cause I feel to bad. And really.. It feels that people care more about that instead of me. The first thing they ask...did you clean. They don't ask... How do you feel.So if someone wants to visit me now I need to know it a few days before the visit. Then I clean even if I feel bad. My mom can't visit me unexpected.She wants to help me... I don't want that anymore. I'm not a kid. Masking my emotions with kratom for seeing people and not worrying them.. Yes I'm not complaining about my life when I see them I'm positive. And I really feel good than. So.. It's not fake... But In a way it's fake. It's making things worse. Not for the outside world they see me when I'm on kratom and don't understand why I'm on healthcare. Sometimes I hear that others are saying I'm taking advantage of the healthcare system. That's very hurtfull to hear.I realize I could have normal life. Just one dose of kratom.. And I feel normal. Like I want to be. But that's not how it works. Now if someone wants to visit me I use kratom for having less anxiety. And yes kratom is a miracle for anxiety depression. A very difficult choice.. Staying at home for weeks or using kratom going to a concert and seeing new people. On my YT channel I'm the most positive person. Making videos talking social. No one has a clue about how I really feel. My biggest fear is losing my parents.. And it's coming closer and closer. I feel so much guilt towards them. I can't even think about that. I owe everything to them. I want them when they leave this earth... I want them to know that I'm doing good. That it's not their fault. They don't need to worry. I will be alright. So they can go in peace. Gonna stop now cause I'm tearing up. Have a good evening.,Personality-disorder
51066,I just want to throw my smart phone away. Hello I'm I the only one? But the more I use social media the more I feel alone. Social media isn't social at all. Sometimes I delete everything on my phone.. Feeling so much better but then I'm getting the fomo feeling. Installing all the apps again cause I don't want to dissapear and worry people. But it's most of the time the opposite...people I support suddenly dissapear. A difficult thing to handle. I'm replying to extended to DM's. When someone criticize me I overreact.. Feeling very bad afterwards.. I don't want to be that way. People dissapear with one touch on a button. And I'm thinking the worst. A person on IG when I had my mental health support page killed himself a while ago. We texted every night for months. I can't save or rescue people. But that was a difficult thing to deal with. Like I failed. So it's better to quit it all. Social media is poisoning society. I can't expect people to care cause I care for them. Sad but true. But it's a vicious circle.,Personality-disorder
51067,wasted opportunities Anyone one else kinda smart but because of zero social skills they never made itI have load of education and a degree but during my degree I was an avoidant mess who struggled socially and once I left there and tried to work it was just traumatic. I'm 30 now and never worked in the field my degree is in and never plan to.I have just closed the door on that part of my life and im still just surviving lol. I hop from one meaningless job to the next usually low paid and then when people start judging me cos they can see I'm intelligent and are like why the fuck are you here I create distance then bail out of shame,Personality-disorder
51068,What is it like for me having APD? For me having APD is like dying in slow motion. You just watch all these years go by one after another as you unwillingly stay alone and sabotage your relationship potential with others.

51069,how to you recover from being a ghoster during the pandemic my social skills plummeted as well as my mental health. i deleted all social media and effectively made it impossible for anyone to contact me. i had a lot of friends many who were friends for 510 years but i ghosted them. all of them. i was in such a horrible mental state for over a year that when i finally came out of it all that was left was shame.its been 3 years now and im extremely lonely but i dont think going back and trying to apologize would mend any of these relationships. i know im a horrible person for doing this but its like i cant help myself.,Personality-disorder
51071,is it avpd? for basically my whole life i have been scared to get close to anyone. getting close to people and trusting them with personal things about me terrifies me but i want to experience it so badly. i feel as if i come across basically like a cold bitch to most people because i struggle to give out compliments or say i love you to anyone especially family. it just feels embarrassing in a way.another thing is that i hate it when someone likes me too much because i know that i can't give them back what they expect from me and it makes me feel so guilty. i had a very average childhood with my parents divorce when i was 5 being the only significant thing i can think of. my dad and his new wife bring up to me all the time that i'm distant and cold and that i need to make more of an effort and i'm trying my best to but even just simple things like calling his wife by her name takes so much energy out of me to the point of wanting to breakdown as it's so overwhelming. i just like don't trust myself or my judgement at all and can never tell what level a relationship i have with someone is atand idk where any of this came from as i don't remember being any differentis this avpd or something else?,Personality-disorder
51073,AvPD among AvPDs Do you feel that you'll be alienated even here among people that have same feelings? I bet they hate it so I won't post anything I can't figure out how to make a good comment so if I do they'll think I'm stupid Should I show same reaction to fit it I'm not diagnosed so I think my experience isn't worth of sharing.Hiding your TRUE SELF even here.

51076,Feeling I don't belong When I'm alone or doing my own thing I don't feel alone so much. I'm used to being alone and doing my own thing and here and there I communicate with people. That's okay. But when I'm suppised to be part of a group I start to feel inferior to others and that I don't belong. Everyone else is interacting with each other but somehow I am left outside the group. The school and Uni were propably the worst because you are alone amongst everybody else everyday. In my current work everything is okay because I work from home and I don't see the others interacting all the time. I just pretend that everyone else is doing their work alone same as me. But. Now we have this group work at my work and now I feel alone again. We should be interacting with each other but I'm not interacting with anyone. In meetings I hear how everyone else has been working with each other except for me.. Group work makes me feel so alone ,Personality-disorder
51077,When people are so surprised to learn something about you because you're so quiet I think we all know that feeling. When you reveal something about yourself and people are so surprised that you're also human. It makes me sad because it reminds me that people see me as this unapproachable amp uncool person when I have my own personality. It makes me feel disingenuous and makes me even more self conscious about how I come off.,Personality-disorder
51078,I'm such a cynical person And it feels totally warranted. Its like I'm sensitive to when people are trying to take advantage of me. I'm aware we live i a society that's all about money. Whenever I see an ad or celebrity I don't feel the positive emotions other people do so much im more focused on the awareness of what they are trying to do. I know in the real world I have few allies if any. I do know good people exist but I am disconnected from them by my experience is too unrelatable and they are hard to find.,Personality-disorder
51079,It's getting harder to pretend I'll be okay My birthday was last month. I turned 26. I went to a buffet with my mom because she was the only one who remembered. It was nice but the whole time I also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life that this is going to be my life forever. And a month out the dread is still here. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about how I'm closer to 30 now than to 20 over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric and I have nothing at all to show for it. I still haven't met basic milestones others do in their teens. And I don't see myself meeting them anytime soon. I never learned how to drive. I've never lived on my own. I've never held a job for longer than a year. I've never had a friend let alone a romantic attachment. Most of my hometown is a mystery to me because I've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. And at this point the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own.Sorry for the melodrama. Point being I'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time. And I can't talk to anyone about it because I don't know anyone except my mom and she really doesn't understand why I can't just force it. To be fair I don't understand either. Thanks for reading and have a good day.,Personality-disorder
51080,Why do I always say to myself that my life doesnt matter? It happened lots of times in my life. I liked some girl and she maybe liked me too but my thought process was it doesnt matter that I like her its just me and I dont matter she is better off without me I will just ignore her or if something bad happens to me and I am like oh it doesnt matter its just me so its acceptableIts like I feel like my life doesnt matter and bad things happening to me and unhappiness is normal. In grand schema things maybe its true but I personally shouldnt feel like this right? My life should mean everything to me it literally is the only thing I will be ever living.,Personality-disorder

51083,Crying when seeing sth cuteinnocent? Whenever I see something cute andor innocent it literally hurts my heart. The classic pain in the heart that anyone who ever had depressionlovesickness knows about. Basically like a dagger stabbing you. Anyone feel the same? Examples Dad just bought a used Mac amp iPhone and he is so happy about it. Wtf would I want with a MaciPhone... But his happiness over such a simple thing hurts me. Mum finishing knitting one of her blanketssocks. Mum greeting the dog. WHATEVER makes mum happy makes me sad af because mum has depression too and idk how she can be happy. Why cant I be like her.... My GF just built a new computer its her first one she is very excited to do some vtubing on twitch or whereever. She's so happy about it... everytime I hear her being excited about it it hurts so hard. When Im alone it even makes me cry rare cuz im usually way over crying depression level wise. Also anything else she is happy about like a new plushie or whatever she cooked its always so innocent that it just hurts. inb4 ppl doubt my AvPD cuz i have GF I ghost her for about 4 out of 7 weekdays for no reason at all cant do anything against it... Yet she stays idk why.The dog greeting my parents. Animals in general.. My grandpa being happy about anything even tho he old.I just want their lifes I guess? I cannot be happy and I only think about negative stuff all fkin day. But im stuck in my own world my own body so I sleep more than 50 of the day. That way I only feel like shit 50 of the day. 5head move I know. Tldr Seeing innocence hurts my heart. Do you feel the same?,Personality-disorder
51084,does trauma play a part in your avpd? i was wondering how many people think the disorder formed because of trauma in their childhood? for me the main reason i have avpd is because of emotional neglect and trauma from bullying. i think symptoms started showing up during the bullying. my self hate really took off from there. its kind of a mess though since i was dealing with depression and anxiety at that age but i can see it all makes sense why i have these symptoms. after just a few years of it i completely isolated myself and spent years in solitude. i dont think i would have avpd without all the trauma as a child. from what i see on certain posts is that some people dont seem have that factor in the formation of their avpd. whats your experience?View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11dwi28,Personality-disorder

51086,Pet Peeve When people think I owe them conversation triggers my AvPD bad. Does anyone else get annoyed when either family or strangers get an attitude with you if you don't entertain their conversation? I can be civil and nice IRL. I'm not walking around telling people eff you eff this eff that. However the WORST ones are the people that think they are giving me golden advice like hey don't do drugs but they have never known me to do such things. It's painting me in a bad light for me to agree with the advice willy nilly. But the kicker is they get upset if I escalate and say I don't do drugs to begin with? Do I look like a crack head to them? They take it as me being immature and unable to take advice. So I am supposed to sit here and entertain disrespectful conversation with people giving me advice on not to be irresponsible and that's what makes someone mature? This has happened with strangers too where they think they can talk to me about avoiding marriage cause theirs suck or dating because of their own griefs. Whether I get married or whatever I do is not their business. I usually only get approached with stupid conversations like that by family. They get big mad when I shut it down. The only carrot they dangle over my head is money. I straight up rather be homeless than listen to me being accused of driving recklessly or my mom threatening about my insurance rates going up. New flash It's my brother's car that has a smashed door because he crashed. My car is fine n dandy.,Personality-disorder
51087,A poem I wrote in high school I was clearing out my apartment today and found this. In high school I sent it in to be posted anonymously in a yearly book of poetry that my school made. To my horror I found out later that it wasnt anonymous. I had no idea what AvPD was then but it is shockingly relatable to look back on now. Hard to post but it feels important that I do.I want to be understood but cannot be vulnerable.The one who shows their hand first loses.Carve into me and leave your markthe first one to strike feels betrayed mostThe retaliation is serratedBut I just wanted to know youwithout borders without painI just wanted to know youYou like me if you can assort melabel me and pin me downaggressive bitch salty witchinnocent dreamer batshit idealist.You color me all kinds of elegantbut when it comes down to itIm only an impressionist.I keep trying to break free of what comes naturally to mefind myself in the labels you offer mebut the mirror image is fake and so am II want to feel myself without your hand in my definition.,Personality-disorder

51089,Looking for some good vibes Hello everyone I am writing this because I've been reading posts on this sub for the past week since I've learned about AvPD from my new therapist and researching about this disorder as I believe I also suffer from it and have a curiosity from you people.Unfortunately not to make anyone feel bad about it as I know this condition is very hard to live with but I have been trying to look for some success stories from people here or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life.So my question for you especially maybe for the older people here with the conditionor the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of success no matter how small what is your outlook on life? What advice do you have regarding managing this condition?Although I've also had a rough couple of days I'd like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help.Please share anything you'd like that might help me and others on this sub.,Personality-disorder
51090,The feeling when a weight of dread is lifted? At least twice a week on average even for a brief period I am flattened by a crushing wave of fear and dread and anxiety to the point where I taste blood in my mouth. It's a sickening feeling like you know something awful is going to happen even though you also know it's not really life or death. But then sometimes that weight is lifted instantaneously through a conversation or email or text. My question is what is your physiological and psychological response to that weight being lifted? The anxiety leaves your body suddenly and then....sometimes I binge eat the opposite of stress eating. It's not to celebrate but to cope. sometimes I have a giddy hyper energsometimes like now it's just a solemn reflectionwanted to know how you all coped with the release of torment?,Personality-disorder

51093,Rescue fantasies Did anyone else have a lot of rescue fantasies when they were young and even today especially in regards to romantic relationships? I started having these rescue fantasies in high school and theyve been coming back into my life recently very hard. I was obsessed with the anime revolutionary girl utena as a teenager and into today in my late 20s. I saw myself so much in Anthy and I wanted someone like Utena to come into my life and rescue me fight for me and love me. Ive never been in a relationship but this is all I can fantasize about now is someone rescuing me and loving me. I recently found a music video like that that I sob every time I watch it but watch it multiple times a day because I want someone to rescue me like that so bad. httpswww.bilibili.tvenvideo2009722095,Personality-disorder
51094,Is this gaslightning? Or something else? Is gaslightning if someone is trying to make you believe that you are unworthy stupid idiot imbecile and that you will never achieve anything in life or is this just some other manipulation?I was getting this from my sister my whole life. She was older than me and even though when she as saying these things to me I always tried to fight back and say something similar to her it didnt really work. She was older and more mature than me so hearing it from her kind of made me believe that I really unworthy human who dont deserve or achieve anything in life. She was calling me names since I was a small child I dont even remember times when she wasnt calling me this.I dont think that anyone would be able to gaslight me easily but hearing it from older sister who I loved was painful for me. I dont even know if I believed these things it just made me feel bad that my sister hates me for no reason or for idk what reason. And that made me think that if my own sister hates me than every hates me probably which leads to low selfesteem I guess.She had control over me when we still lived under the same roof. Anything she said I did for her like some servant.Only years after leaving I realized what was she doing to me wasnt right.Is this gaslightning or is it something else?,Personality-disorder
51095,what to say to those who you ghosted and what they might say I know some people are happy to cut ties with people but others feel guilty or anxious about cutting ties and freeze because too much time has passed. If someone reached out to me and said something along the lines of struggling with personal things that would be so helpful even if much time has passed. The people who you have ghosted are probably hurt and confused and the truth is they probably internalized it as something THEY have said or done wrong. If they did not do anything wrong that is something to highlight.Hi. I just wanted you to know that I have been struggling with some personal things and that's why I haven't reached out. I am still struggling and not ready to maintain friendships just yet. But I do want to let you know I care. I'm sorry if I have left you hurt and confused. It was not something you have done wrong. I am not in a place to explain further but I do hope you are well.Some people may be understanding and some people may still be reeling from the hurt and not respond at all or they may decide that they do not want to open the door back up to having contact with you now or in the future because they felt that they were rejected and don't want to risk that again. Rejection hurts people without mental illness too! That is not necessarily a rejection of you but more of a reflection of the place where they're at mentally. It may have taken them a while to move on from the relationshipfriendship. Some people may feel that keeping that door closed is protecting them from getting hurt again. In my opinion that is more than a fair response so before you do reach out if you decide to you have to mentally prepare for whatever decision someone will make. One way to look at it is you get the chance to prepare for their response when they never got a chance to prepare for being ghosted unless you let them know you ghost at times.,Personality-disorder

Or when you become a regular at a new place and other regulars start remembering you and you're no longer '' new''?Me too. I did not know it was an AvPD thing before finding this sub. The worst part is i want to socialise and i want to not care what others think of what i e' joy. But i care.

51102,Rock. Bottom. I'm at rock bottom right now. I'm about to lose my job my next work day most likely and be jobless. Family is so disappointed in me. Everyday I'm in survival mode at work. Avoidance had bleeded into my job and I can't help it. The anxiety is too crippling and it makes me do all sorts of weird awkward shit at my job. My chronic isolation outside of work also seemingly killed my social skills so I feel numb to all interactions. I sense a mental breakdown is about to erupt and I'm likely to walk away the job but I'd rather get high and lose my job over marijuana then quitting. Either way I'm doomed. I have a bad reputation in my job at this point my real self is being exposed coworkers for sure shame gossiping me. My coworkers all have strong connections with each other now and I'm still that one insecure awkward shy guy. So ashamed. Worked my warehouse job over a year and half now. Idk how I made it this far but my behaviorial symptoms have caught up to me. Literally avoiding everything at work and everybody. Hide in bathroom during breaktimes. Avpd and depression worst combo. Consequently I didn't save enough money while working this warehouse job not only for myself but for the sake of my immediate family as well so everything about to come crashing on me. Addictions make saving money hard even at the sake of supporting family . I let myself down and my family. Sighhh. What a crippling hell of a condition avpd depression is. No excuses. I can't even leave my house. I can see myself being homeless potentially in the near future. Everything that involves making a decision I literally just can't do and that includes getting help. Ik this was a lot y'all just wanted to vent . Your not alone if reading this keep your head high I don't mean to bring u guys down .

51104,Relationship I started a relationship 6 months ago with a great guy both of us are in our early 20s and were friends for a while before starting the relationship. He's kind openminded respectful communicative I have no complains about him. That being said since last year mid 2022 I've had multiple problems related to my family and my mental health has gotten even worse. I have no friends and my only company is him and I dont think is healthy for him to be with someone like me I selfisolate been doing that since I was a girl don't have much time for him studiesworkfamilymental health my family doesn't support my relationships and they're capable of harming those I love they're abusive but I have no possibility of leaving home especially in my country. I barely have the energy to wake up in the morning and have spend the last years by myself without friends or a partner because of that. I'm diagnosed with depression AvPD and eating disorders and have gone to therapy with different psychologists who had different approaches for 10 years and I have took different med combinations with no success. Currently I'm not in therapy and with no medication but I'm saving money to start again in March.What should I do? I like him and I love him but I don't even have the energy to answer his messages let alone dates and be a proper partner who listens to him helps him spends time with him etc. I have told him all of this and he still wants to be with me but I feel the relationship would end up being onesided and I don't want that for him. I'm deeply ashamed of myself. Since day 1 I've cried every day and night because of that and because of the ridiculous amounts of energy I need to do anything especially things that have to do with the relationship. I've tried to change and get better I've spent so much money on therapy and meds with no results I've read dozens of selfhelp and psychology books and hundreds of papers I've tried to change my habits diet sleep more etc but I just dont know how to get better.Sorry for any grammar mistakes English isn't my first language,Personality-disorder

51109,I'm grieving a three day long situationship worse than people leaving a three year long relationship I have BPD and two and a half years ago I met a guy on a trip. We only hung out fro three days but our conversations were so interesting. We spoke about politics education etc. He told people he liked me. I was so excited that he liked me. Usually I don't take big leaps like this but since we live in different countries I went up and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and he cut off all contact with me. They broke up two months later and I'm 75 sure he's been stalking my social media since then but he hasn't reached out to me.I know it's been a long time but I miss him so much. I miss him. And I cry about him everyday. I need him. I just feel like I'm stuck in this pit of despair. And I've tried to change. I've dated other guys. There's another guy that I like way more and I know he likes me too. But there's still a part of me that misses the vacation guy. I don't know why I feel so stuck.,Personality-disorder
51110,snippets about me that maybe y'all can relate to This is an incomplete list of course but I've taken ages to build up the motivation to post SOMETHING here this is what I got for now. I'm hoping anyone reading this would please add to the conversation their own similar experiences or attributes or would please ask me to expand on any point I have listed.I need to consume multiple forms of media on multiple devices in order to be content. I divide my attention towards trivial topics. I have detailed dialogue in my head that I desperately wish I could record but whenever I try it's not detailed I get tired of it and it ends up unfinished. I have countless unfinished drafts and scattered files that I take endless time to organize only to still not post what I initially wanted to. I take hours to get myself ready to go out typically to my local dive bar. I know I'll enjoy myself when I get there and I know a lot of familiar friends and faces there. But once it's time to leave I psych myself out over going my primary concern is that I don't look as nice as I usually do or I'll get a detached disassociated feeling once I get there. Many nights I end up going to bed with my outfit and makeup freshly done and still on never have left my place. The red notification circle showing me the amount of unread text and unanswered calls I have is so large that it breaks me out to open the damn thing at all. I end up ghosting relationships that I didn't want to abandon. The guilt of how long it's been when they last sent a message to present day keeps me from responding. If I have to make plans with someone I have to actively not look at the other unread messages below it or else I'll have an internal panic. I'm selfisolated and alone and lonely more than I ever have to be and I fucking know this. I highly value people and relationships despite how my avoiding nature implies otherwise.My childhood consists of consistent moving for rarely to none disclosed reasons. My mom is an aggressive woman who's genuinely diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it's difficult to communicate with her. Growing up I never lived in a location even close to 2 years. I think this has fucked me up in many ways. I am a very vivid and active dreamer. I speak frequently in my sleep sometimes I wake myself up for my own talking. 4 years I had chronic nightmares and was a bedwetter the nightmares and accidents were most frequent after every move. This subsided by age 24 when I was done with University and moving as frequently. I've used meth for nearly 8 years via smoking and snorting never injections. It's never made me feel horny like it does most people. I compare the sensation to taking 'dirty Adderall' meaning I have a zombified obsessive focus on whatever task. I'm either indulging in rabbit holes or addictively playing chess on my phone. More broad and accurate to say is that I productively procrastinate my place will get so clean or I fulfill minuscule todo task but I continue to avoid my most pressing and urgent needs. Actual Adderall feels like medicine to me. Like the focus increase isn't jarring but natural. There's no crash and no tweaked out feeling. I feel like what I believe I'm supposed to feel like as a content and motivated individual.,Personality-disorder

51112,Overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations Social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and I have to come up with responses on the spot. There is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations or when someone is trying to sell something to you.So before these situations I often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. This makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison.There are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. For example suppose I was buying something from a shop I hand over my money and then the shop keeper just ignores me what can I actually do in that situation? Call the cops? Get a lawyer? What proof do I have that the money was mine and I handed it over? What obliges the shop keeper to give me the item I wanted? Normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place they've never been burned by it so it just works for them. But here I am worrying over every little thing that I'd rather hide away from it all if possible.,Personality-disorder

51117,Society has already collapsed and I don't want to be a part of it. I've isolated myself for a long time. I never fit in anyway I couldn't make connections last. I always messed up. But I tried. I now realise that it's too late. I grew in such an abusive family that I never learned how to love and relate. And then I fell ill. Since then I became disabled. Sometimes my arms hurt so bad that I can't type. I've been trying to survive a gruesome situation for months now. I can only communicate in short bursts. All the rest that I need is gone. And I put myself out there. Ashamed and small. Guess what? No one cares. I'm at fault too. But it's not only me. I hope it will be over soon. But I rather struggle alone. I hope that I can get some of my hobbies back take up space. I can't chat anymore it makes me want to barf. I can't really go outside and to be honest I am scared. I found out how easy it is to abuse me. It's not like I can run just hide. There's nothing much to say. I truly am alone. I am different but I just want to be in peace with myself with the chronic pain with the fact that people and I don't work together. I'm not charming or young. I'm just venting into the nothingness. I isolated more and more when I got negative feedback. It's too late now. Everybody struggles I don't understand basic things. I just want the current crisis to be over. Don't want to improve myself. Or to function. I want to breathe and sleep without fear until shit really hits the fan and we'll all break together and apart. Sometimes it feels like too much to ask. I want to believe that I matter not because of someone else. It's not going to happen.,Personality-disorder

I could really use some reassurance I made a tik tok post about a band I like and I mixed up the names of the members misspelled the renowned venue they played at and accidentally said one of the members passed away. Two ppl in the comments pointed it out and now I feel like ripping my skin off. Instantly I started saying to myself you should honestly just kill your self whats wrong with you thats so embarrassing kill your self over and over. Sometimes I picture myself being impaled or shooting my self in the head.This happens all the time and its one of the most debilitating parts of this disorder though Im not diagnosed. Any time I remember something slightly embarrassing I did even 5 years ago I have a totally disproportionate reaction to the embarrassing thing. Does this happen to anyone else? I feel like Im doing much better than I was a couple months ago but this persists. I hope this isnt too upsetting to share for anyone.,Personality-disorder
51119,Where did my AvPD come from? So I am officially diagnosed with it but most people on the internet and also my therapist say that it is likely because of a childhood of abusivenarcissistic or in any other way bad parents that resulted in this condition. But I dont think that it comes from that. I couldnt have had better parents or family they supported me respected my opinion and so on. I have the feeling that I always was like that even in kindergarten back then. The only thing odd about my parents was that they divorced as I was 6 years old but I guess thats not the most uncommon thing and that my father is also very socially avoidant. Could it also be the latter like in a learned behavior? or do you think it is more likely that it was something in the past that I just forgot and dont remember dont think is significant enough?Often I ironically feel a bit isolated when I see comments on YouTube or Reddit talking about the reason for the AvPD because I cant relate at all to their stories thankfully tho but you know what I mean,Personality-disorder

So I just walked away.I told another girl there who I trusted and she helped me feel better. But these situations are why I struggle with going outmeeting new people.

And I'm seeing all the good times they've had the relationships the weddings the vacations.And it makes me wonder if I could have been their friend or if I could have been doing those things with them. Sometimes I'll think back to what I was doing at the time the post was made or the photo was taken and find myself comparing my empty life to theirs. It makes me feel like shit and yet I can't stop doing it.Does anyone else do this?I don't think it's really the traditional FOMO that people often feel when engaging in social media posts because I'm not sad about other people doing something without me right now so much as a broader envy of their life in general. It's not envy of someone posting pics of their nice car or fancy hotel room on Instagram it's not the heavily curated photoshopped influencer stuff. It's envy of people who went backpacking with friends one summer in college. It's envy of people watching the Super Bowl together.

Im supposed to be graduating this semester yet Ive gone to none of my classes or done any of the work. I have no motivation and I feel that I legitimately dont deserve my degree. Im withering away and dont know where to start fixing this mess. It bothers me that Im failing out but not nearly as much as the fear of how my abusive family will react to having to bail me out of trouble again. Never mind how it feels to still be so controlled as an adult. Ive already had to withdraw one semester for mental health purposes and I cannot bear having to admit that Im in an impossible situation once again. And they dont even believe Im mentally ill. I dont need their approval I just need to not be verbally ripped apart. It would take too long to describe how cruel my family can be but it is enough that I am living in a full breakdown trying to keep this lie holding together. My dad once called me a 23 year old loser and I keep proving them right. And yet Id willingly take abuse over the solitary confinement I live in now. I cannot do this any longer or Im going to snap in half under the weight.,Personality-disorder
51131,Im a success story hey all.I have been going through a lot these past few years like everyone else. I realized I have high functioning autism. I mended my fractured family. I found family at work. I found god.I found peace within myself. maybe I never had avpd but I still identify with it. I do so strongly that I feel it necessary to post here because I relate to every one of your guys posts.and I came up with a 5 year plan to achieve my dream of rvandwellers. I have a lot of stuff I want to say. I have big big things in the works for my life. my goals are endless.you can find me on instagram nowatlast if you want to know about me. my entire life is there. I hope thats okay to add. Ill delete this part if not.anyway I just want to spend my life spreading joy and love and light. hippies had the right idea. the only reason were here is to be kind to each other. there is no other reason.everyone have a great night or day its a hard life out here,Personality-disorder
51132,has avpd destroyed my personality? Of course personality has its meaning in avpd but when I said personality the second time I mean a person as in the things they like to do or what they talk aboutI've always been avoidant and I think it's rooted in multiple harsh rejections between age 5 and 12. I've come out with 0 interests to talk about besides drawing and 0 drawings to show because I don't want to show anyone. I don't show anyone anything and I don't tell them anything unless that conversation territory was already stepped into. Have any others experienced that where they're uncomfortable telling people about their interests that they end up with none at all? Or secret interests? For me I have a secret interest but I still can't get myself to talk about it with other people interested in it. It's like we start talking and I have no idea what to tell them. My brain is so messed up that it just blocks out every subject that is slightly attached to my inner self leaving stuff like weather other people whatever they already said ofc those conversations degrade quickly...I end up having no further input fast.,Personality-disorder
51133,Being avoidant and the pandemic I dont know what it was about the pandemic that hit me but it hit me hard and I still find myself stuck in so many ways. I was never so scared in my life.I became agoraphobic and couldnt leave my house. I became obsessed with the news and the statistics. For someone who has been suicidal practically my whole life I was truly afraid of dying.Did anyone else find yourself getting worse through this and what did you do to get past it? When I go to doctors appts they still make us wear masks and that scares me a bit still. Like what do they know that we dont?Im sure Im overthinking things like I do with everything else. My daughter is anti vaxx and it worries me too Ive had them all as a precaution since my health isnt the best now.

One of them was relationships she told me that she prefers to be in a relationship with traditional gender rules.this made me think and realized that a relationship with traditional gender rules isn't for me and i think this mainly has something to do with being avoidant. these are my reasonsI don't initiate or take actions. Usually i respond to actions even sometimes i don't respond to actions that other people would respond to i rarely take actions or be proactive.I lack assertiveness I also have problem with decision making.that is what comes to my mind when i think about it.Guys with avoidant do you think that you can be in a relationship with traditional gender rules? also do you have any other reasons beside the ones i listed if why not?,Personality-disorder

51144,Social anxietygeared remedies and treatments have made things worse Trigger warning for suicidal ideation mention.Also long post alert. This is something thats been brewing for a while that I hadnt been able to articulate until now.Im 24 years old. Ive been actively trying to combat social anxiety since I was 17. And after reflecting on these past years I truly feel like all of the things I did to try to improve have only made my feelings worse and solidified my fears. For example public speaking I was told throughout school and therapy that practicing public speaking would make it easier over time. I was also told I would need to do a lot of it to have a successful career. So I did the following joined the media club in high school where I made intercom announcements and once made a TV announcement. Taught Spanish to children as an assignment. Took opportunities to read aloud in class and chose speaking assignments when given the choice. In college I had several mandatory presentations. I joined clubs and did almost weekly public speaking for various purposes for them. I called numbers for a bingo game for over 100 people and also proctored a club election. I then became a resident advisor which involved pretty regular public speaking. Let me tell you it did NOT get easier yall lmao. I swear to god I kept telling myself it would get better and waiting for it to get easier and it only got harder emotionally. I definitely improved my skills but every public speaking incident wreaked absolute havoc on my psyche. Like throwing up beforehand staying up and ruminating after shaking emotional anguish insomnia the works. Like Id argue it got even worse as time went on. No amount of praise was ever able to shake it and ive received some pretty consistent positive feedback. I have this thought of like probability. Like I WILL fuck up and embarrass myself during an event. And every time a speech goes well I feel like my odds of failure increase. Plus Im not sure how much I trust the positive feedback Ive gotten. I can accept that Im an effective speaker but anything more than that feels fake like people are lying to make me feel better. So public speaking hasnt gotten easier. Im out of options. And its frustrating that no one around me understands this because to them Im a sufficient speaker. But the idea of speaking to a group of people makes me want to fucking kill myself. Like every time. And now I have a ton of lovely memories that play in my head when I think of speaking. Like my brain has the motherload of material to make me feel deep levels of shame embarrassment regret anxiety etc. I wish id never started doing this stuff because now people actually expect it of me and I am haunted by awful memories that make me feel worse than I did before. I mean for fucks sake Ill get in a panic because I remembered speaking to KIDS. Six year olds. Who the fuck is embarrassed to speak to six year olds? Remembering things like this can straightup ruin an otherwise perfect day and completely sour my mood. Its not just public speaking. Its making friends joining clubs volunteering working the works. I faced my fears and they fought back viciously. And after covid isolation I find it literally impossible to force myself to try these things again even though I know Im capable of them. I just dont want to contribute to the material my brain uses against me. I feel full like Im out of storage space. Im just sick of the regret and embarrassment and guilt over existing the way I did. I feel like Im destined to spend my future disappointing people and failing. Ill never be like I once was and even if I do then it will just be exhausting and miserable. Right before covid I was reaching a breaking point anywaylike I was about to quit my job or get fired and possibly school because I couldnt handle the hole Id dug myself into. I feel spent and directionless. I dont know what my goals are anymore. I dont even know who I am because I spent so long trying to be someone Im not.,Personality-disorder

51147,So I just started taking medicine. Like I said I'm just now getting medicine for this. I don't think I really needed medicine but my therapist has been trying to get me on medication since last year. I finally agreed to it and I took the first dose yesterday morning and the second does this morning.I have noticed no changes yet but he told me that it could take a while before anything really changes. All I've noticed is how paranoid I've been that they are giving me a placebo. I want to get the pills they gave me and open up the capsule just to see if there's anything in there but if there is then is it medicine or sugar? Maybe it's just some sort of powder that doesn't actually do anything. What if they are giving me fake medicine? Are they trying to see if I can change just by believing some miracle pill will do something? It feels like they're trying to disprove my Avpd even though they were the ones to diagnose me. It didn't help that my therapist told me that he was excited to see what I look like when I'm medicated. What is that supposed to mean? I can't tell if he would just be excited to see me improve or if he is trying to test me somehow.I don't know. I think I'm thinking about this too much. Anyone have some advice? Kind words maybe? I'm going to keep taking the medication unless something bad happens so don't worry about that part.,Personality-disorder

51149,AVPD and RHONJ I feel dumb about thisI enjoy watching some of the Bravo Real Housewives shows with my wife. However I find watching the RHONJ makes me anxious. Most of the RH shows are based on confrontation. But RHONJ is the most confrontational. As a man with AvPD when I see the husbands on that show just about fistfight in confrontation I feel anxious and lessthan. I know mist of it is staged but it always leaves me questioning my own manhood. Ive always been conflict avoidant in fight situation. Yet Im drawn to viewing RH with the hope maybe the guys reactions in that show will help validate my own feelings.

51151,Does anyone else feel like theyve wasted their life so far and that death is probably inevitable in the near future? Im in my early 20s and struggle to see things getting better even though I probably have the power somewhere in me to change for the better. I guess Im just getting impatient and frustrated with myself because of the way I am. Ive been feeling low again lately and the biggest reason is probably loneliness. I wish simply talking to others wasnt a struggle and I wish I didnt view my appearance as objectively terrible amp repulsive. I wish I had things to talk about and I wish I was someone people looked forward to seeing. And I wish I knew what people thought about me even if very few people have interacted with me. I wish I could make a positive impact on someones life. The thing is as much as Id like to make a friend would the friendship even last considering Im over halfway into my university degree? People will move away and move on and itll be back to how things were before. Its probably so dumb that I sometimes feel like death is the best outcome for me as I wouldnt have to live a life of wishful thinking. Sorry for this cringy post.,Personality-disorder
51152,Getting out my comfort zone Im a 24 year old female and Ive had a lot of mental health issues. One of them is AvPD. I struggle to maintain friendships because I always push them away out of fear they will see the real me and I think Im an empty person with no personality. I never developed my own personality. I always mirrored people to fit in.I have an intake tomorrow for a rehab clinic. Im addicted to Xanax. I think the addiction is just a result of my mental problems that are really complicated and go far back into the past. After the rehab I will go to Portugal for an intense treatment for 2 months all by my own. No phones allowed. I think itll do me really good and Im glad I have this opportunity. I know they arent going to fix my problems and I need to do it myself but it is a big step for me to travel alone. To really work on myself. Its a step forward.

51154,Two days ago I tried to kill myself Has anyone here attempted suicide or seriously harmed themselves. Two days ago I lacerated my wrist with a knife and had to go to the ER and get stitches. I nearly severed an artery luckily I will make a full recovery but I feel a deep sense of regret and shame that I did this. I don't want to get into too much detail but it happened in front of my family. I also tried to to choke myself with a piece of clothing and physically assaulted my family as they were trying to stop me from hurting myself. I feel most guilty over this as I am normally a very passive person but I let my own emotions take over and didn't stop to think of their wellbeing. I do not come from an abusive family at all they love me which is the reason why im not on the streets right now. I have been in a really bad mindstate for years now due to isolating myself but this was all my fault and obviously i need to take responsibility for my own actions. I have a deep sense of rage underneath myself which i try my best to mask. Most people who post here seem like good people but i feel like i'm not.

I 100 have this issue but Im not really sure why? Im usually thinking of it in a social context because it feels like Im not enough of a person to make connections but I dont know if its for the same reason you guys might feel that way.

It feels like if you want to beat this thing in some sense you need to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have. Life feels like a video game. Most of us play it on a hard difficulty and we are wondering why are we so far behind other people. Most people are the way they are because they are that way not because they chose and worked hard to be that way. Do you think outgoing social type of person chose to be that way? Maybe in some cases. But more likely than not it wasn't his choice what made him that type of person.

I'm not going to pretend to understand how it works and I definitely don't recommend it because there are several people who have had severe adverse effects with it but I have found a new unintended use for it and I wanted to share this discovery.Sadly as a sad effect I find myself dragging my feet to do anything I just lose interest in almost everything.,Personality-disorder
51169,suspecting avpd hi. i suspect i may have avpd or something related to it. id like to preface this post by saying that i started reading up on this disorder about an hour ago so clearly im not going to jump to any conclusions here or at least im not trying to. i just think its possible. i also have adhd and im on a waitlist to be tested for autism. if that helps.ive struggled with severe anxiety issues for years. almost all of them are related to how people are perceiving mei have intense anticipatoryperfomance anxiety i fear that people are either going to think i act strangely think im stupidincompetent or both which will lead to a general dislike. this fear has grown so large i assume most new people i come in contact with dislike me think im odd and talk behind my back. it got so bad that i dropped out of high school and havent been able to hold a job since i get overwhelmed very easily a combination of aforementioned fears and sensory overload. ive been unemployed for a long while because the idea of even searching for or applying to jobs sounds hopeless and its ruining my life. i always wanted to go to college growing up but im frozen with fear and unable to attempt going. i fear that even people very close to me that ive been friends with for years are talking behind my back and they dont really want me around. i love interacting with people for example my mutuals on social media sites but i become fearful when they get closer to me and we interact more often because im afraid that they wont actually like me if we chat one on one i wont fit into their group of friends theyre just pretending to like me theyll think im stupid etc etc. i have such an intense fear of rejection at every turn oftentimes hitting hard enough to feel physically painful. im doubtful because sometimes i can talk to people fine. the fear is in the back of my mind and sometimes it presents itself far more plainly but other times i dont have any issues interacting with people. talking to new people is also way easier since itd be far more upsetting if someone im already attached to decided they didnt like me and abandoned me. i also identify with borderline symptoms yet i constantly fear theyre not severe enough i would fall into the quiet bpd subtype. i rarely lash out. i isolate myself and agonize over my interpersonal relationships and the state of my life. sorry for the oversharing. i can elaborate or answer any questions. just please let me know what you think. anything is helpful.edit id like to add that im seeking a psychologist right now. im not in the absence of professional help. i just want to know what people who actually have it think.,Personality-disorder

In 6th grade I moved to another state for about 6 months then I moved back to where I was up until my first or second year of highschool and then I moved again. I feel like this might be what cemented my social stagnation. I pretty much ghosted everyone I knew and every time I thought I was putting roots down I had to relocate. although I didn't really have many friends but it still hurt Because my mother didn't want anyone to know we were moving I just had to vanish.

51171,Married ExCoworker Stress So there's a situation that occurred and it's tearing me apart from the inside. I'm absolutely terrible at showing emotions and making a move. Hence my terminal aloneness. I wish it was terminal...Last year during the summer I temporarily got to experience what it was like to be wanted. A coworker and I became friends and she seemed to express interest in me. Time and time I'd go hang out with her only to go home banging my head in frustration and wondering wtf was going on. Here's my only other post about her for reference httpswww.reddit.comrAvPDcommentsw1us95situationinvolvingmarriedcoworker?utmsourceshareamputmmediumandroidappamputmnameandroidcssamputmterm1amputmcontentsharebutton Tldr of old post she's married but they are about to separate over issues they've had for years. For those that think I'm being scummy maybe. But she's leaving the country for good next month without him. Meanwhile she's seemingly expressed interest in me while at the same time holding me at arms length away. She tells me all of these personal things about herself including some secrets she says she's never told anyone. However If she gives me a hug it's half hearted most of the time. But with other guys like the one she said weirded her out she is willing to fully embrace them. Here's a worse part I have a car and she can't drive. So when she needed things she'd pretend to want to hang out and go check something out. Usually then we'd go back to her place and she'd cook something for me and I wouldn't feel it was a total loss getting food for the gas spent. But the last two times I went over there she kept going on and on about how tired she was so I left. Basically having been used as a free Uber. But here's the worst part!The other day on Valentine's Day I called her up and she's busy chatting with strangers on Omegle. This one guy is flirting with her and she keeps telling me about how good he looks... and how he wants to do an online video date with her clothes optional. The whole time she's giggling and basically ignoring what I'm saying. So I say I've got something to do and hang up. She has the fucking nerve to call me back and want a ride somewhere before she goes home to get some rest. I keep it short and civil what choice do people like us have? and basically hang up and go to bed. The next day I texted her to ask how did your little edate go? She responded huh? and I haven't talked to or heard from her since. Highly unusual because she always calls me several times on my 2 days off. Those days are over and I feel an incredible amount of stress about it.. my heart is going crazy and I feel like I'm waiting to get punished by the principle or something. I guess I lost whatever that was.. Life never wastes an opportunity to kick me when I'm down.,Personality-disorder

I'll be looking to get my doctor's reference to a psychologist to hopefully make some progress with all of this. Even though I'm a complete hermit who is not at all good at getting daily things done I do have at least a bit of hope of turning some things around I still have hope that I can make progress for the better.

I'm subhuman and that's not going to change anytime soon. I think about suicide everyday and I hate myself beyond measure.,Personality-disorder
51176,I don't want to see her either! I lost touch with an acquaintance. Well she chose not wanting to see me because she sort of blames her mental health on me which I did not cause. I literally did nothing to this woman. She was into literature and writing and I encouraged her writing a little and we both knew about each other's anxiety. We didn't talk about our problems though. She shared she had social anxiety. She knew I had generalized anxiety but that has improved greatly for me now. That was the extend of us knowing about each other's problems. She decided me having anxiety equated to me being a negative person and that is actually not true. She doesn't even know me well enough to determine what kind of person I am so that is part of what upset me. The other part is just the way she went about the situation. I have zero interest in ever reconnecting with her. The trust wouldn't be there and I'd always be fearful of saying something wrong or of being hurt again. See it shouldn't hurt so much just from a little ol' acquaintance but it did hurt so much. When you live so close to each other and end up in the same public spaces at times it is awkward and somehow I feel like I am in the wrong for being there when I have every right to be in public spaces.,Personality-disorder
51177,Consultation on the treatment of Avoidant Personality Disorder My childhood assessment showed that I have been suffering from Avoidant Personality Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder Social Anxiety Disorder and Selective Mutism. In the last year my doctor has prescribed antianxiety medication such as Buspirone and Pregabalin to help me feel relaxed and hopefully make me more confident to communicate with people outside of my family.However until now I am still very nervous and terrified of talking to people outside of my family. In this way apart from making me unable to make friends I am also too nervous for interviews making it difficult for me to find a job. Please advise me on how to overcome my symptoms of Avoidant personality disorder Selective Mutism or Anxiety Disorder so that I can join the workforce.,Personality-disorder
51178,I feel like my mind is going to explode I feel like Im stuck in a never ending loophole. I dont know what i am anymore. I think about my personality a lot why am i like this? At times i feel like this strong confident person and at others i feel the complete opposite. I remember i used to feel some type of connection with people now i dont anymore no matter how close they can be. Im never fully comfortable with simplest shit i never give out a true answer maybe i dont know the actual answer myself? Im talking the simplest dumbest situations where Im asked to express myself about a certain thing. I often deny that i have any problems with my personality and that i am completely fine and this is all a delusion in my head and sometimes i feel like this completely mentally broken person with avpd sa depression did etc! This can happen multiple times a day its exhausting to keep shifting through these completely different mentalities this often. I feel like Im losing my mind like who the fuck am i anymore???,Personality-disorder
51179,why do I feel like I scare people? So i am currently in college for nursing I've been practically a hermit of a stay at home mom since 2016. I thought maybe I could get past my anxious feelings of making friends in once I got to school but it's turning into the same thing all over again. I have in person class 2 days a week and I met a girl who was open about her mental health. We clicked and I thought great I can do this I can make a friend. We even exchanged numbers which is HUGE for me. We texted a little but then in class she went from sitting next to me to jokingly saying I'd rather be next to insert classmates name. Now I have tried to be chill with this other classmate too. We had a similar dark sense of humor but then the past two classes I felt like a third wheel. Like the first girl just started to distance and almost mean yet she asks me to study with her and the other. I am.so confused and also feel like they are pitying me. Like I just wanted to flee the class and sob because i felt like once again people automatically shut me out bc of my quirks. Idk if this is an AVPD thing or an autistic thing. I just feel defeated and alone. I so desperately want a friend.,Personality-disorder
51180,How the hell am I supposed to deal with the ADHD AvPD combo? I am formally diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder tendencies. My therapist and general practitioner both believe that it's caused bycomorbid with inattentive ADHD but there is no formal diagnosis for that yet. I am taking adderall 15mg XR for it though and it is the only thing that has ever helped me.How the hell do I deal wit this hellish combination? I've deconstructed and deconstructed but the only point I can reach is that I understand why and when things are happening and that they're irrational but I can't change it.I have a handful of fixationshobbiespotential professions that I jump between and I never know if I can trust myself to know what I want. I feel like I'm at an urgent crossroads in deciding what to do with my life and I'm unable to stick to one idea. Is it ADHD distracting me with a new shiny thing? Is it AvPD ghosting my previous interest due to perceived failureinvalidation? Is it both working in tandem? I envy people who can dedicate hours a day to a single thing for upwards of a year. Video game speedrunners come to mind specifically. That's not something I am interested in but I am beyond jealous of the ability to sit and do one single thing for ludicrous amounts of time and perfect it.Anyone else experience this sick little combo?,Personality-disorder
51181,Is it petty to treat someone the same way they treat you? Recently I noticed I was people pleasing too hard and decided to try a little less. I was too clingy was the one to wait after class to go together was the one to write first etc. My friend usually doesn't do the same and as someone with rejection sensitivity predictably it hurt. So when I stopped trying so hard my friend seemed hurt. She said something about me not waiting for her like I usually do. Admittedly it felt good to finally let go a little and have some selfrespect. But I also feel so bad for being kinda... petty. I don't think she did all this on purpose because overall she is a really good and caring friend. Maybe I just frustrated her with being too clingy in the past?,Personality-disorder
51182,Getting used to loneliness I feel like before I really longed to be part of the group. I longed to have someone who would choose me over the others. I longed to be someone just like anyone else. But somehow nowadays I don't really want that anymore. I'm just so used to being alone in the group alone at work and anywhere else that I just prefer to be alone. It feels like a burden to be a part of something. I prefer to do my thing in the group like at work but I don't want to get mentally attached to anyone. I don't know if it's a survival mechanism to protect my own mental health or if it's just because I'm tired of trying to belong to somewhere. Maybe I have just accepted who I am and what will never be. Does anyone else feel the same? I don't mean this to be a negative post as I don't feel sad about this. I'm just stating how things are and I've somehow made peace with it. Maybe in the future it can make me feel sad but not atm anyways.,Personality-disorder
51183,I'm just very lost and exhausted so here's a little about my situation I struggle with extreme avpd I've been to therapy for 8 years with many different people. And I just feel like I'm sinking lower and lower as time goes by. It has gone too far and now I'm in a situation where I struggle to even open the front door or open my mouth to speak. I've lost the few friends I had years ago cause of the severe anxiety I felt and the panic attacks I had after meeting them. I live with my dad but I rarely talk to him cause even that is too hard for me. I studder opon my words and feel like I can't even have a regular conversation with my own parents without the severe stress I feel.I feel so hopeless and fragile. All I wanna do Is keep caging myself inside my room with my distractions. But I'm also incredibly unbearably lonely and ache for genuine human connection. But I know I'd never be able to have that in the near future if ever.,Personality-disorder
51184,Does anyone else do insane mental gymnastics to get out of going places? I swear some of the reasons I've come up with in order to avoid meeting people... it's so crazy like why can't this creative energy be harnessed anywhere else?For example I've literally riden a 30 minute bus to a place walked right up to the door then heard the dreadful sound of people inside.. and that's all it took for me to make a 180 and ride that same bus back home. The reason in my head was like hmm they're meeting next week so I can just wait until then surely I will do it next time D It's just Ahhhhhhhhh I hate myself man. Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why am I like thisand the thing is I really need the socialization too like I'm so freaking lonely... the instant I arrive back home I'm like shit I really should've just gone in now I have nothing to do again why did I listen to myself and it just makes me even more depressed thinking about how pathetic I am,Personality-disorder
51185,claustrophobia attacks Can anyone relate to this no advice please? So I don't live alone I live a single family member that sometimes has their boyfriend over. I also do work part time in retail which is all I can currently handle. Our schedules usually allow me enough time alone even if I want more of it. Summer is a lot better for me because I can comfortably go outside in spaces where I'll be just as alone so it's extremely rare that I have these attacks during it. To get to the point there are some weeks in Winter that are a perfect storm for AVPD. Our schedules will clash where they'll be home every single moment I am for almost a week on end. For the first 34 days I'll get a bit more irritable but handle things and still do ordinary things that involve other people hearing me like music or watching youtube videos and keep up with people well enough online. Though it starts to snowball on 5 usually. The way it comes on is almost like a physical illness. I suddenly feel extremely on edge in the background I'll start not listeningwatching anything and avoiding doing anything outside my room hypervigilance shoots through the roof my mood begins to swing like a pendulum really snappy and in general human.exe stops working. I won't even be able to really handle having Discord open. Usually comes with tension aches too in my body here and there. If I even have to go out and get the mail I become a mental train wreck I won't be able to handle being outside even if no one else is out without being on the edge of a panic attack. just going into a different room becomes an anxiety ridden chore. Going to work as you can imagine as I must force my way through it is an absolute nightmare as you might expect. The anxiety and irritability completely socially cripples me to add to the embarrassment so I go through the usual motions like an NPC to the best of my ability and use that break time very strategically based on how time usually feels there. If I'm lucky I'll loosen up a bit much later at night enough to watch some youtube or enjoy some quieter music. The only way I found to cheat it which costs a little money unfortunately is to order takeout food later for some reason home cooked food doesn't work? I guess it's because I have to do that here with them around and have my usual comfort ritual of watching some youtube as I eat hoping someone is streaming something I like. After that I may feel alone enough somehow to enjoy some music and mindlessly fart around on the internet. Since the only factor is that it just involves someone elses comfort food they made for me I have no idea why this works. It's impossible for this to go on more than a week cause schedules break it up after a week and give me back that time but it can take me a day on my own completely to recover. I noticed this specific family member being home with me too long is the trigger though I don't know if it's just them or others that can trigger these episodes too. It's as if I become to opposite world nightmare version of myself because normally despite my AVPD and CPTSD I'm much more positive and bubbly in personality. As long as I'm self medicated correctly and have just enough space I tend to do ok socially. I feel more like a wounded extrovert than anything since I desire close connections but at the same time I avoid everything that would lead to any being formed because I feel closed in on very quickly. There's a lot of tug of war that goes on with me internally like this.,Personality-disorder
51186,I feel out of place no matter how much I try I recently signed up for uni and the first two weeks have been okay if only I'm only slightly disappointed for not doing more to talk to other people and befriend them.I still managed to befriend two or three people. I try my best to talk to them but even just greeting them makes me feel anxious because what if they didn't want to greet me or they didn't want to talk to me or they're talking with someone else clearly closer to them than me or at least more interesting. So I end up feeling out of place because I can't gather the courage to talk more while they all befriend each other.Despite all of these feelings I kept pushing through and this last weekend I managed to ask one of my classmates friends who I considered myself to be the closest to to hang out and they accepted. It went well we talked a lot and in the moment it felt like we were having fun. But when I came back home all of these awful feelings that maybe they were uncomfortable and didn't really want to hang out with me or talk to me and they were just being polite and nice or maybe they were just trying to see how it would be like to hangout with me realizing I'm more of a nuisance and a bore than it's worth to keep around started consuming my mind.I tried to push these thoughts in the back of my mind as much as I could but today I already went to class with all of these thoughts filling my mind. I saw my friend ? enter class but I couldn't bring myself to talk to them. Not even a single greeting nothing and I felt like a piece of shit for not trying more because surely they thought I was rude for not saying anything. They were talking normally to other people during break time and I envied all of them. I wish I could talk so easily with other people befriending them. I wish I wouldn't be scared of saying anything in fears of being ignored. So I ended up feeling out of place again despite my desires to fit in.I thought maybe at least we'd have the chance to talk after class. No. All I could manage to mutter was a halfcut word before they said goodbye even if smiling and walked up to someone else to talk to them. My logic says everything is okay and today they were simply on a rush after class but my AvPD says they absolutely hate me and don't want to do anything with me anymore.I feel like I messed up big time and that I lost a potential friend. I feel like I lost all my chances of having friends ever again even. And I know it's my fault because I should have talked more but when I talk more I'm scared to scare them all away. I hate how hard it is to simply say 'hello' and ask someone how they're doing. I feel like I'll be seen as a weirdo and ignored even if the person is a friend.So I don't know what to do.Sorry for the long rant. Sorry if I used the wrong flair too I don't normally post anywhere. I just really needed to vent.,Personality-disorder
51187,Thought I'm getting better I'm single approaching 30s have a stable job and stable family. Getting more skilled at my job recently really helped boost my confidence and I'm used to being a nonvoluntary lone ranger. I thought nothing could hurt me anymore.Yet today something simple triggered me. Someone I joined the company with got married yet I was not invited but few others were. This is not the first time this has happened. I can count on one hand how many times someone invited me and not as a second thought. Also the embarrassment when I only learned someone's wedding is coming when having a random group lunch and learning I was not invited yet trying to sidestep other's question if I'm coming. I always think they have a separate group chat with majority of them and always wondering why I'm not included. Maybe I'm too boring and not prettyfashionable like them.I've long come to terms with the fact that people are just not interested in me since I was a teenager. Always not being invited being left out of information or plain rejected to my face. I never have a romantic relationship and no guys ever show interest in me. All the vague 'friends' term I use whenever I talk to my mother to hide the fact that her daughter was all alone ever since she entered university.It just hurts so bad and reminds me so much of my teenage years. One day I wish I'll have a partner who always puts me first in his thoughts. Thanks for reading my rant.,Personality-disorder
51188,Antidepressants To those of you who have tried antidepressants to mitigate this condition did you find that they were helpful? If so were there any brands in particular that worked well? I know this is highly individualistic but would like to know if certain ones worked better than others.It something that I have been putting off for a while now. However Ive gotten to the point where it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to give them a shot but I never wanted to deal with all the side effects. Interested to hear your experience on this.,Personality-disorder
51189,Anyone here feel incapable of love? Never been diagnosed with AvPD as I am too scared of asking my therapist what he thinks since by his writing he doesn't seem to care much about PD labels and I'm too afraid I will look like one of those people who tries to be cutequirkyuniquespecial by hunting for diagnoses. But I resonate a lot with the stories and thoughtsfeelings I have read from people who have AvPD and a lot of it sounds like things I have saidthoughtfelt almost word for word.I'm curious if anyone here can relate to my childhood or if I'm being overdramatic. I won't go into it too much because no one cares about my stupid sob story about why I'm a loser but I basically had a very emotionally dismissive mom it's your fault for being upset and an explosively angry father taught me it was NEVER ok to say no. Since both of them worked all day I was pretty much raised by my older halfsister who had issues of her own obviously and she would constantly bully and belittle me. My halfbrother essentially ignored me when I was growing up. I was also constantly bullied in elementarymiddle school for being weird and shy and had to see therapists that I didn't want to talk to when I was as young as 67 years old.I'm 26 years old and have never datedkissedhad sex with anyone and have never made any attempt to do so. I don't have any friends except on the internet. I used to think a partner and friends were things I wanted but thinking about it now I feel like either as a result of my upbringing or maybe some other brain failure I'm really not capable of loving anyone. I'm not even sure if I love any members of my family. I can also never be 100 comfortable in a room with someone else no matter how long I have known them for because anything that would involve me being me I would need to be alone for. Anyone relate or am I just a sociopath?,Personality-disorder
51190,Hey here are some thoughts of mine I believe some or all of you could relate to for your next therapy visit.. AVPD In summary So I feel..Sexually compulsive I feel energy drained.. stress accumulated leading to failureStress about just anything in general.. too much of itDifficult to have own opinion I doubt if I even agree on the way that I feel or think about a certain topic at times. I believe this stems from stressDepressed.. sometimes I just feel like all the light and life has been sucked out of me at random times. Occurs usually when Im around people and gives me a feeling of desolation like I am emotionally alone in my own worldI want to finish this with a little bit of food for thought of what I have come to a conclusion is what doubt has done in your life and mineGuys think of any moment youve felt doubt.. remove moments of doubt which you can be sure of where the doubt came from like at school while taking a test. Now every other moment where the reason for the stress feels out there in the galaxy thats where I strongly feel stress inhibits us and we dont even bat an eye and question it. But why question why you are stressed.. isnt this just part of who I am? I should learn to live with it.. its so difficult to live this way we are so intermingled with stress that it just becomes a part of us and sadly we stop seeing it this way for whatever reason we have but doubt lives upstairs from us casting a cloud over us every time it kicks and stomps over our thoughts and our ambitions into what feels like uncaring mundanity..,Personality-disorder
51192,Thanks for being the community I never dreamt to have so yesterday I had a therapy session and the therapist asked why i think i have no friends.i answered i have interests that few share where i live as i live in a small city so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live i told him i am part of many online communities but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in these communities even if they are based on my interestsat that moment i remembered reddit and this community and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without fearWhen I joined reddit it was for something tech related then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidanti was new to reddit and navigating it but i was happy as i found people like me.as i kept browsing i started to get related more and more to your posts. I felt a connection to you and i realized i am not alone anymore.Knowing i am not alone anymore is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for it meant i have People who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through.People who can understand me and i can understand them.People with who i can share whatever i want knowing they will understand me and won't judge me in this communityi don't hesitate or feel shy to share anything with youfrom sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advicehere I share my problems and secrets that no one knows including my family.I finally found a home here and family this community really seems like an oasis in the desert I have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible.i feel blessed that i found you and being part of this community i just wish I could meet you or some of you in the real worldand to newcomers welcome abroad. in one way or another you aren't alone anymore.,Personality-disorder
51193,Feel like I'm too far gone I'll try to keep this brief as I tend to ramble on about how much I pity myself. I just feel like no matter how much work I put in it will never be enough. I have been getting out of my comfort zone lately and putting myself into more social situations but the more I do it the more disillusioned I become. I think that even if the fear and anxiety I feel with socializing was removed I'd still only ever be able to interact on a superficial level. It's like a fundamental part of me is missing. It feels like the best I can ever hope for is to function in society at a basic level. Sorry to be a melodramatic downer. I'm just feeling really low today and wanted to put my thoughts out there. Maybe someone can relate. Thanks for listening.,Personality-disorder
51194,Oh god I just feel so soul crushingly alone I cant take it anymore! I dont know how to reach out to people online to make friends let alone my classmates in real life. My parents only ever want to talk to my sister on the phone. Im so isolated and deprived of any attention or social interaction I feel like Im going completely fucking crazy. I dont even know where to begin getting help through therapy! I know the first step is to even TAKE a step at all but I just get so paralyzed by terror I cant do anything whatsoever. My college has some counseling program theyre partnered with in this city but I dont know how to reach out and beg for help. I dont even know what words to use I need a script or something. Im 22 and I dont have a single close friend every time I take a personality quiz that has a question along the lines of how many close friends do you have and there isnt an option for zero a part of my soul dies. My boyfriend that I only stayed with out of fear of making him mad by breaking up with him broke up with me a couple weeks ago and the ONLY social interaction I had whatsoever following that was extremely explicit anonymous sexual harassment on Tumblr that still makes my skin crawl to think about but I didnt tell them to stop until a different anon said hey dont you think this is kinda predatory? because I didnt want to be the killjoy by asking for it to stop and anyway I was probably overreacting about the whole thing to begin with but now that thats over since I blocked a few of them and turned anon off Im back to zero socialization whatsofuckingever! Every desperate cry for help feels like Im just screaming into a vacuum I dont know how to get out of this fucking hole Im trapped in Im too goddamn spineless to claw my way out. Can anyone hear me?!?! I just want someone to acknowledge me directly for once I just want my classmates to invite me to lunch again they used to invite me daily last year but at some point it feels like they just gave up on trying to get me involved and now its all my fault I still dont have any fucking friends. At this point I dont even want to blame the AvPD I just want to blame myself for letting this shit perpetuate in my brain so much its like I let a mold spread in here and now its in all the wrinkles in my brain fuck.,Personality-disorder
51195,Update to 'Oh god I have a date' My old posthttpswww.reddit.comrAvPDcommentszwc806ohgodihaveadateHi everyone!Since you all were so kind I wanted to share my experience. The date went okay but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards shorter answers not really engaging in text chats. It felt like she had no interest so I stopped texting her. Last Wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. I chatted with her and some other people. It was quite nice. Afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking. She talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it therapy and so on. She was quite open and frank. Later when I was at home I thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. My picture of her had changed a bit. Previously I would have said she was quite the confident woman I still think she is though but afterwards I saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities. So I today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee. She texted me back that she thinks I'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me but her life is too full right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. She'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. She is sorry that's probably not the answer I was hoping for but she is just trying to being honest. I wrote back that it wasn't the answer I hoped for but I thought I would get. I thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome so I had to write her. So that's it. I'm a bit sad now although I knew this would be coming. Still it's better to be in the clear. I've given up some hope to find a partner. It's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated live through the frustration and get out of it on top. My few relationships began during those very rare moments in my life where I was truly happy. A condition that feels unreachable at the moment. This makes it feel impossible to find love. I try to be the best person I can be but it never feels enough.,Personality-disorder
51196,Does your anxiety fear of judgment rejection or humiliation stop you from doing daily basic tasks ? Do your triggers replay in your mind constantly ? I can said I have hight functioning AvPD. I go to work teach my classes .I'm constantly wanting to improve and develop a strong career path and get enough money for surviving in a Latin American country. But a few things happened while in quarantine I was depressed isolated with my family grieving that a part of my body wasn't functioning well and got removed that destroyed me and on top of that my religious trauma and the stupid comments of my mother who things all the things need to be her way or not be at all. She hurt me terribly. Anyways as I isolated i created a new perspective of shame and was constantly bullied by neighbors for my attitudes and behaviors as I was bragging a lot due to my financial and career position were higher than of those adults around me just at 22. I know that's awful and was against my original principles but I think I just tried to cope. I'm more mature i recognize it was a mechanism to avoid rejection and shame. Like You can laugh or make comments about me but you are average and I'm not. I started working at higher education by the time . I feel so much shame after all that happened and my avoidant traits have gotten even worse. I barely leave the home. I just go to my job go home and repeat the cycle everyday. I am going through some medical difficulties nowdays and I have to come to the realization that I can't live like this anymore. This is not life. I don't do anything else apart from working and existing I cannot practice any hobbies or watch anything cuz I think that if I sing in portuguese or Spanish or English somebody on the other side of the wall is gonna be ready to laugh at me. I don't even talked to my parents unless I feel sure nobody could hear us. Sometimes I try doing something and past memories come to hunt me . I tried moving out on my own but the fear of being judge for being a female living alone and not talking to anyone has taken me out of the apartment and I've been paying it for two months now without living there. Putting as an excuse that once I recover more from a recent surgery I had I'll go back to my place. Bless your heart if you took the time to read all these mess.,Personality-disorder

51198,Might i have avpd? Alright before i start i want to say that im 16. Ive been showing some symptoms as long as i can remember but i hate self diagnosis so i want some help. Because i dont want to have a pdobviously Ive been extremely shy and untrusting of others ever since i was a small child. Im often rude and cold to people bc im extremely afraid of someone talking to me and try to make them think im not talking to them bc im arrogant and not a loser whos afraid of everyone. But im more like the second. Ive always been insecure also i had a history of self harm. But i did that because i feel like im not enough and dont deserve to even breath the same air as most people not because im suicidal. I had suicidal thoughts a lot but i never considered doing it because im too much of a coward for it. I also project my insecurities on people a lot and try to find someone inferior to me to communicate. Ive felt inferior for so long that i want to be superior to someone so i project my insecurities and drag them down. Im not jelaous by any means i just want someone inferior to me. I dont think i even need to mention i have no friends and push anyone that tries to talk to me bc i suspect theyre bullying me. But i have good relations with my family even though they also make me a little anxious. And i have a diagnosis of gad,Personality-disorder
51199,Therapy Success for AVPD? Anyone? Ive only recently discovered my disorder falls into AVPD 6 of 7 characteristics. Ive been going to a psychiatrist for years whos treated me for depression Zoloft. Ive always been shy overly self critical etc. Ive been to 5 Therapists over the last 20 years none have really helped me. Weve identified the causes of my AVPD very critical parents physical abuse. . Sexual abuse in Jr High. However thats a far as I get. The rest is just talking about my feelings. I get 6 to 9 mos in and I feel like Im just saying the same stuff. So I quit. Has any AVPDsufferers ever had success with Therapy? What does success look like? I cant even imagine. Are you more socially successful and bulletproof from criticism? What methods did you use in Therapy that made you successful? What did you do beyond talking about your traumas that helped you?What kind of Therapist was helpful in getting passed or improving? Is there some specialization or kind of therapist that is more successful with AVPD? Thx.,Personality-disorder
51200,How does one with AvPD even begin to entertain the idea of being in a romantic relationship? To me the idea of being in a relationship like that is the ultimate danger as the level of intimacy in that dynamic is as high as it can possibly be in life. It is just hard to comprehend myself being able to deal with something like that because the fear is overwhelming. For this reason this is one of the hardest things for me to work on despite making inroads in other respects.I have learned to personally engage with people in a platonic way although I have a sort of mental dissonance that keeps most social interactions at a superficial level. But it seems like that is not a possibility with romance which is why I have not been able to adapt or understand how to even go about it. This is why like many other posts I have come across on here I have virtually no experience at 27.I'm wondering how others have even begun to be able to make an effort to seek one or even be in one as the possibility of rejection and having to be emotionally open is amplified. I realize that avpd obviously is an individualized experience and other social dynamics might be more difficult for others and this is not me saying that I believe those in relationships are lying about their diagnosis of course. It's just moreso that I have a difficult time relating and understanding how you guys who have succeeded in this have made this progress.,Personality-disorder
51201,I know this probably isn't AVPD but sometimes I suspect I have a bit of it due to symptoms but that doesn't mean anything School sucks. All I do is hide the bathroom every break time to avoid social interactions because I also know there isn't anywhere to go or sit. If there is a place in the library I hope that nobody sits next to me or looks at me. I think people stare at me but when I look up they're not. I wish school days went faster and feel like I get anxiety attacks.I avoid making friends at school because I feel inferior to people. Like I don't deserve them and they're much better having someone else as a friend than me because I have 0 social skills and stress to maintain friendships. I try to seem mildly interesting by having hobbies but i know it isn't enough. I sometimes feel severely lonely and depressed at school and at home but try to distract myself from that. I don't speak a word at school. Somedays I dissociate and everything feels like this isn't my home or I'm dreaming.I think this is just general social anxiety but do any of you relate? BTW I'm not trying to self diagnose. I just need some help...,Personality-disorder

51205,Do I leave this friend? She's been a friend of mine for 5 years she's caring loyal and she's always been there for me but she has this habit. If she's upset she'll ignore the shit out of me she'll snap at me for the smallest of things without warning. I've told her she has the right to be upset and express herself but she can give me a heads up instead of ignoring me and making me feel guilty. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. I asked this on a avpd reddit because I already feel lonely I can't imagine losing her as well. What do I do?,Personality-disorder
51206,Anyone else feels like this? So i went to the shop today to collect an order. I told the cashier my name an so on.

But it's a lot.

51210,Anyone run the other way from their friends? I have always struggled making friends developing deeper relationships and feeling safe in friendships. Once a friendship starts to develop into something deeper I run the other way. I think Im so scared of being rejected that I reject myself before it can happen to me or catch me off guard. I think Im also paranoid that people are just being polite and no one actually likes me especially if I pick up on any tiny clues that this might be the case. Clues look like friends not texting in a while friends not inviting me to something hanging out with other friends without me or just some way that I interpret their communication or tone. Does anyone experience this and how do you keep from running the other way when you cant interpret if youre truly wanted as a friend or if you need to back off? Do I just need to take a leap of faith?,Personality-disorder
51211,I do not struggle only with the fear of being rejected but also the discomfort of rejecting I don't know if anyone else here feels like this but I've noticed that the thought of having to reject someone I don't like is also feeding my avoidance.At this point I already know that I'm not compatible with 99 of the people near me I can't connect I have some niche interests and different beliefs and values compared to most of the people where I live.Finding someone I really like is something that happens one time in years and even though I know they exist it is very rare for me to find them.The thing is sometimes people see me being more reclusive and think is just because I'm shy I guess they feel pityempathy for who they think I am so they start trying to socialize with me but the truth is I am willingly distancing because I don't see anything in common with them or sometimes see things that actually annoy me but I feel so uncomfortable rejecting their attempt specially if we have to see each other a lot even If I know nothing that satisfies me will come from there.Because I have experienced the pain of rejection a lot of times I feel empathy for them or as I said for what I think they will feel when rejected which is the same pain I've felt in the past but I also think there's also a factor of fear of judgement and therefore rejection I guess? here because I'm afraid they will find me arrogant rude mean superficial someone with a superiority complex or just straight up be mad at me. I have this good girl syndrome and the thought of someone thinking bad of me is so excrutiating that just doing what is more comfortable for the others and not for me seems to be easier but of course it's not being sustainable on the long run.So yeah nowadays I'm also avoiding social interaction and new relationships because I know that I'll probably not like or be compatible with the person am afraid of being judgedrejected and also of having to reject.,Personality-disorder
51212,Is Aversion to physical touch affection cause anyone else to tense up and feel uncomfortable? Hi I'm not sure if this is an AVPD thing or a CPTSD thing...But I have a strong rejection of any physical touch that's comforting or affectionate.I'm permanently tense and hypervigilant and I now have a lovely dog who is so loving but I notice I basically reject her affection of leaning against me by tensing up. I've tried letting go and accepting the comfort of her touch but it leaves me feeling very strange and uneasy. My dog is very smart and notices the miniscule flexes of my muscles and my pushing back at her and will either walk away or try harder to 'love' me affiliate with me by persisting with her leaning against me with a little bit more weight. She's quite a teacher like that and could maybe help me learn to accept loveaffiliation.The same has happened with professional physical massages. I would be 'body armouring' against the touch and tensing up and trying to push away the masseur instead of relaxing and accepting the physical touch and enjoying that experience.I have a feeling this is related to an early life trauma thing... but I was wondering if any one with AVPD relates to this. I don't know why I feel so repulsed by physical contact it makes me feel squirmish and so uncomfortable in danger almost..Often if I initiate it and am slightly dissociated I can do it. But there's a wall there preventing it from being too authentic or entirely organic essentially going through the motions without mindfulness due to the layer of dissociation in the forefront.Then there are other times when I can genuinely be affectionate for a short while to my dog.. giving her a stroke or cuddle without being dissociated instead mindful. However after a little while this is when I think AVPD comes into play.... as I then start to think I suck at being affectionate and that my dog thinks I'm an idiot or annoying or needy or something. so total lack of self confidence comes into playMy experience of touch is kind of like comforting a strangerin my experience you're not 100 in the moment as you're not sure what to do to be there for them. Except I'm like this with giving all friendlyinformalaffectionate touch. And receiving it seems to scare me. It confuses me and makes me feel incredibly vulnerable and I rebel against it from the very core of my psyche and body. I can feel like a child perhaps toddler age.. inside me trying to fight off an opposing force.. when I am touched which makes me think it's a traumaCPTSD thing.Wish I knew how to work with it.. I get overwhelmed. No therapist currently..Things like I will start stroking the dog as it's happy to see me and wagging it's tail. But then when the tail stops wagging I'll instantly feel like I've done something wrong or the dog isn't enjoying the attention failuredefective schemas or low selfesteem simply. So I then try stroking her somewhere else or give up. gt I'm sure a therapist could help me navigate this quite easily.I do have times when It works I can be affectionate and not crumble in failure if the dog is non responsive I guess the other times I'm seeking validation that I'm being comforting? the times it works cohesivelynaturally are getting easier with practise... but I don't know any tools or practical ways to get better at it when I'm not feeling like it. Most of the time I just want to be alone.. and this dog is very affectionate and I don't want to fail at being reciprocate. and of course this is all prelude to having human relationships.. which are infinitely more complex.,Personality-disorder
51213,I am no longer afraid of ghosts since I get AVPD I went out to throw garbage in the middle of the night today it was dark outside and there was no one there and I was not scared at all.

51217,i dont know why i dont like having relationships with people ive always felt extremely anxious around people and unfortunately due to covidquarantine ive gotten really used to and fond of being alone. ive have friends but im horrible to them i feel extremely guilty about it but i just dont know what to do. i constantly avoid going places with them by coming up with really elaborate excuses i dont let them know anything about me or my personal life either. but theyve always for some reason have come to me for advice and to vent i dont necessarily dislike when they do that but im not opening up to them about myself and i think im hurting them in the process. the idea of me having friends or even a romantic relationship sounds really nice in theory but the moment anyone shows any sort of initiative to become my friend i immediately become exhausted or even sometimes annoyed. i feel like such a deeply horrible person because of my cowardliness since i dont ever express this to anyone. i just dont know what to do i want to be alone but i also want someone to care for me and i care for them but i realistically just dont see that happening to me maybe i dont deserve it i really dont know. this all sounds really convoluted but if anyone relates or has any advice please let me know.,Personality-disorder
51218,Went to a busy store today Hello everyone hope you're all having a good one! I went to best buy today to pick up a new phone and im ngl it was quite stressful. I had my phone for about 5 years and it was time for an upgrade. The whole process of trading in my phone was so stressful because not only was the employee kinda anxiety inducing to deal with but he trashed my sim card by messing around with the sim tray on my old phone and tried to say my phone was too old and that i can buy a new one because they're cheapSo after all that mess I had to walk to my carrier and the closest one was closed. I was kinda shaking at this point because I felt like my whole day was going wrong but I got kinda brave and took an uber to the other side of town to replace my sim card I lived to tell this tale lol Tldr upgraded phone but best buy employee trashed my sim card so had to journey all over town to get a new one,Personality-disorder

51221,Ive decided to opt out of this disorder lol Im not an extrovert I dont want attention Im okay with being silent I hate small talk I want deep connections that come from a place of mutual patience and empathy and Im sorry to admit this so late but I wont find that with like 99 of people. It just is how it is. What Ill try to work onIll allow myself to fail stutter or mumble when I dont feel comfortable talking in groups but Ill talk nonetheless when I have something to say so that I can practice that which Im not good at.Which means Ill allow myself to feel discomfort. Deep discomfort and shame which I know will lessen one day or Ill get used to the feelings. Ill allow myself to be intimate with people I feel comfortable with. And to warn them when I feel like fleeing and hiding. The right people will understand and wont give up so easily. Ill accept failure expect disappointment and revel in misery because I know it will lead me to something better than this dark void Ive been living in the last years of my life. Thank you.,Personality-disorder
51222,Does anyone else feel like they're too boring to have friends? If you ask me what my hobbies are I can't name any. If you ask me what my talents are I can't name any.I follow current events politics foreign policy. I read the Washington Post and the NY Times and The Economist. I listen to podcasts. But to me that's not so much a hobby as just part of being a responsible citizen who keeps up with what's going on in the world. I try to go running or ride my stationary bike a few times a week. But again I don't see that as a hobby but just doing what we're all technically supposed to do to minimize the risk of health problems. None of these are things that really bring you closer to people or are conducive to meeting them.When I was in college there'd always be some guy who was an amazing guitar player and people would just magnetically gravitate toward him and just vibe. I've never had any musical talent. Or people would just play frisbee or pickup soccer. I've never been able to do something like that. My body freezes up I panic I'm afraid I'm going to make a mistake and everyone else will get mad at me. In middle school PE if we had to play soccer or basketball I'd always just stand as far off to the side as I could and run away from the ball if it was anywhere near me if I was getting in trouble for that I'd say I had to go to the bathroom or wasn't feeling well and needed to see the nurse. In HS I ran cross country precisely because so much of the competition wasn't being watched you didn't have to do anything with other people and if you messed up it was solely on you and nobody else would get pissed off at you. A lot of people seem to do things like play softball or volleyball in rec leagues and I wish I could do something like that without having a panic attack and feeling like a fucking spaz. I've never really played video games. When I was growing up my parents basically forbade me from playing any that they regarded as too violent which meant nothing like Halo or CoD or the other popular franchises people would get into. And I've always avoided them as an adult because if I started spending a bunch of time playing video games by myself somehow that would make me feel even more isolated than I already am.I've never really done any traveling because I've always felt too selfconscious to take a trip by myself. I'm a guy so I don't have the excuse of safety which can be an issue for women doing solo travel in some parts of the world. In college I never did any kind of study abroad because I was afraid I'd get there and nobody would like me and I'd basically be trapped there for weeks with no way to escape. I'd feel embarrassed about not being able to speak to people in their native language even though virtually no Americans can do that anyway. I see people on social media backpacking through Europe or Asia and hanging out with all these people they just met and I have no fucking clue how they pull that off. Does anyone else feel this way? Almost like you're just a NonPlayer Character in a video game who doesn't really get to have their own story while everyone else is going on adventures through life? If I meet someone and they ask what I like to do I basically draw a blank. Or if not do you have any suggestions for how to make yourself more interesting?,Personality-disorder
51223,I feel like I can't come out of isolation because I have nothing to show for it No friendsaccomplishments etc. Just been living the past few years in isolation. I have a deep sense of shame about this and I finally feel like I want to come out and like be a person again. But the thought of meeting new people who didn't waste years in isolation makes me queasy. Making friends when you have none just feels downright embarrassing. Reconnecting with people I lost touch with years ago due to this lovely PD is also mortifying. Sorry I stopped talking to you I took a break from being a person for a few years isn't really something I feel comfortable admitting. How do I explain myself without scaring off everyone? What if I do engage with the world again have a good thing going for a while and then just shut down again only this time with a new batch of people to disappoint when I inevitably ghost them. So I do nothing. The cycle continues.,Personality-disorder

51225,High functioning avoidants I dont know if this is even a thing but I feel like it describes me.

I did get married twice but left quickly as soon as things became difficult and while I was in them I was very much a loner. I had no desire to go out with friends do things with family and such.I start projects with earnest and get so excited about them yet cant follow through to finish them.Even on Reddit I have no problem starting a conversation yet when someone replies it puts me in flight mode Im so afraid Ill be seen as dumb or unlearned. Or that my opinion isnt worthy of a response.I have the get up and go that got up and went I guess you could say.

51231,Childhood I just found this group recently and it got me thinking. I feel like I was always this way but it doesn't make sense to me that someone would simply be born this way. One of my first memories was standing behind my parents and somebody asked them What is wrong with him? To which they responded Oh he is just shy.In the first grade during story time I would face against the wall 2 feet away from everybody and just daydream. Never joining in but according to my mom my teacher found it cute so she never said anything.I found it embarrassing at the age of 7 when someone would call their parents mommy and daddy. I would sit with the kids that bullied me during lunchtime because I desperately wanted them to accept me. Up until high school I would constantly go to the nurses office trying to act sick so I could leave and at the very least be able to laydown for sometime.From middleschool to highschool I found my way to kinda fit in which was through humor gained a lot of attention but I only felt like I had 2 real friends this entire time. Even though id spend countless nights crying thinking those friends really hated meAny girl I liked in highschool I would never pursue because I didnt think I deserved them. Im sure everyone here did this though.Since the focus is on childhood im going to stop here but I just find it interesting how for me it seems I was always like this. How is it that in early development someone can be so selfconscious?,Personality-disorder
51233,I Hate School I am currently in my second semester in college and I hate it. I am not the most intelligent person but I try my best. It's expensive but my scholarships cover it so I am going for free. I am very grateful that I have this opportunity but it is terrible. I started with a mandatory orientation where all we did was walk around and talk to each other. This was my personal circle of hell. I can manage in small groups but this was at least 30 people. A week of that.ampx200BI also had a class called you at school. It was ALL TEAM BUILDING. It was a showup for credit class and I almost failed because I wouldn't participate. I had to do a presentation and just started crying in the middle of it. I have never been more embarrassed in my life. I went to sit down and the girl next to me was patting my shoulder and asking if I wanted to go into the hallway for a bit. I don't like people touching me. ampx200BNow as a recovering addict I have another Layer of Isolation. Everyone is in their my mom is not here let's party phase and I can't be around any type of substance without jeopardizing my sobriety. So I can't just show up to an open party or talk because that's all people do now.ampx200BI also have a class that's just discussion groups. It is 12 people so not as bad as my larger class' except no one talks. It's just the TA repeating the same question prompt over and over till someone speaks up. I wanted to fill the awkward silence so I said something and now I am expected to talk all the time. ampx200BI hate talking. I wish I had an invisibility cloak to go to class with. I am ruining my education because I can't function properly. And I am so jealous of others around me. I want to be happy like them.,Personality-disorder
51234,How am I supposed to make friends? Im 25 and havent had any proper friends for like 10 years.I know lots of people are in this situation but I feel like its extra hard for me because I am such a sociable person at heart and talking to others is the main ways I naturally feel happy. Im not confident but I have forced myself to go out and meet people but I think my personality is too weird that Ill never really get close to anyone. It takes so much energy to push myself and open up to strangers and be my socially awkward embarrassing self in front of people so when I manage to do it and dont make friends it makes me want to give up at life.I think about this all the time and never get any relief from constant feelings of loneliness and boredom and emptiness and when Im around people like working and realise Im not close to anyone it I have to literally use breathing exercises to stop myself from crying because I realise that Im a huge mis fit and the odds of me making a friend with my avpd and everything are extremely slim and I shouldnt have as much hope as I do. I dont know what to do anymore its been a long time and Im just waiting for something that isnt in my future and I want to give up I dont know how to keep going or what for.,Personality-disorder
51235,Trying hard not to push everyone away Ive found myself in more groups in school this semester and its really starting to affect me. Since I have to talk to my classmates its hard not to become acquaintances with some of them. But now I feel like Im in too deep and need to retreat. I want to shut everyone out to protect myself. I know its stupid because they arent mean to me or make me feel bad its just in my head. My mind tells me that they dont really care for methey just have to talk to me. What is that? Why cant I just believe that people can like me as a person? Constantly having to battle my negative thoughts about myself to keep from shutting down on everyone.

51237,Speaking my mind when talking to my therapist I have no problem with being open and honest with my therapist. But no matter what I say I never feel like anything I ever say is true. I can talk about how sad I feel or what it feels like to have a conversation but somehow my brain always wants me to think that Im making stuff up or something. I have so many conversations in my head where I feel like Im able to express myself fully. But once Im talking to my therapist or anyone else for that matter its all just nonsense. It just makes me feel so god damn lonely and stupid.So I told my therapist about this and she suggested I make a recording or write whatever I want to say down so that I can express myself more fully.

51240,My father My father is an addict and overall an incomprehensible and insufferable person. He never gave me nothing. He has never been willing to listen to me and when I insist on expressing my ideas he calls me punk alienated or callow. He never gave me a useful advice. He's extremely obsessive and unflexible. His neuroticism hits the skies. He talks with imaginary people. He's unable to follow the most basic social conventions to the point of harrasment in very grotesque ways. He believes that most people including me my mom and my brother are zombies dominated by the virtual world and the hegemonic imperial power that displays an upside down world sic.We live in Venezuela. He believes or used to believe that he was secretely the number two of the regime that Maduro qouted his tweets and that the Intelligence Service escorted him 247. He believes that his neighbour who has been repeatedly harrased by him owns the biggest child prostitution ring in the country.Despite coming from a consolidated upper class white family and having opportunities in places like San Diego he never worked. He never provided. My mom who comes from a family of peasants has provided everything in my life by nothing but her own hands. When my grandmother died due to my father's negligence he inherited a ridiculous ammount of money by selling our house. He wasted it all in obvious scams in exchange for literal bottles of rum and whiskey. At one point I felt anxious about the prospect of him not providing a HOME for me and him.He has always been a parasite. When he could he consumed alcohol in copious ammounts and acted very aggresively and disturbingly. He made me cry sometimes. He brought my mom to the brink of madness. His surroundings always smell like tobacco and piss. Now he totally depends on my mom for survival. He's a eternal thing in my life.,Personality-disorder

51242,Why can't I do just one thing? So I've posted here before but here we go againI work on hobbies skills and side hustles very intensely but never intensely enough to do anything with them. I have a degree in music education so I'm really really good at researching and breaking things down to the fundamental level in which I can learn them effectively. I am capable of picking things up very quickly. It's almost like the huge dramatic improvements you make at the beginning of a skill or hobby give me the validation that I crave.The problem comes when I hit a plateau in improvement. These plateaus where you stop making huge dramatic improvements happen naturally. Due to my super sick AvPD tendencies this plateau is perceived as invalidation and rejection. I'm aware of how ridiculous it is but it continues to happen. At this point I basically ghost the hobby and start with something old or new. Whether or not I retain the knowledge from my fixation is anyone's guess.What should happen at these points of plateau is thoughtful consistency. If you continue to chip away those vast improvements will happen but over a larger timespan. I am unable to achieve that consistency because my AvPD tendencies make it extremely difficult to get past the first plateau of any skill.Ideally I wish I could just spend months and months even years fixating on doing just one thing so that I can actually see these trees bear fruit.Here are a few examples of what I mean ContemporaryJazz saxophonebass. Have the skillsknowledge in order to play and make a nice amount of cash gigging or playing weddings. Can't use these skills because I lack the consistency to go to jam sessions monthly network and learn the songs necessary to operate in these settings.

51246,What should I do? Sorry for my bad English but I've been bottling up for too long and I don't know what to do no one can understand me even my parents and therapists and strangers on the internet.Last year 2022 in February I quit college online cuz I can't handle it even though I got a good grade in one of my courses but I didn't think I got it at all! And after that I wanted to start the business but I don't have money my mom gave me money but she just gave me 16 she said After the items sold out I will give u money again. But when I started to sell in my shop it didn't succeed cuz maybe I just have little items. Also when I was in college my mom rarely gave me money unless it was for college tuition and the money for internet. My father is still alive but he never paid for my school. But the hurt thing in my life was my stepbrothers think that my father never gave them money cuz they think that all of my father's money was used up for me. And now I am 22y.o. I sent many job applications about 20 or more but just get accepted for 1 job but I ignore it cuz I can't ride a motorcycle and I think the salary was too low. I was thinking that I want to go to another country for a job so I can get better life cuz I have a chronic illness and mental illness but I don't have money. I told my mom about that but she didn't agree with me she want me to just stay here. I rarely lied to my parents when I was asking for money but now sometimes I am lying to them cuz I think they are too stingy for just the only child in this family. I wanted to try short courses to get a remote job but I am unmotivated. People on the internet was saying that I have a sexy body when I sent my pics to them. I was thinking that maybe I can get a job in onlyfans but I was too shy about that. I've never doin' voice calling and video calling when I was doin' sexting. Btw I am still a virgin but sometimes I want to try to lose it but now there is no way to lose it cuz I have no life and my life is messed up.,Personality-disorder

Probably I can rent for a few months but everything is so overpriced so I'm not sure. And it's middle of winter. So anxious right now. I tried to look for a job online but didn't find anything there's nothing irl cause I live in small shithole town and I probably won't be hired that way anyway. But I didn't actually try hardly to find anything just sitting on my ass procrastinating. Don't even have any friends or even acquaintances so.. ,Personality-disorder

I feel like when someone such as my boyfriend or family are upset that it is my fault.

51252,Coping Ok this is gonna be really weird and random but I just wanted to share this because..idk feels like something meaningful to me I guess? Thinking about all sorts of things takes like 99 of my day my brain never shuts. And when I think about big picture like the world outside my internal one and my struggles I am getting upset and resentful over my life. My one true friend during those times is my imagination and fantasies about life where I am normal and just..well happy. About a month ago I finished watching playthrough of Lost in Vivo and this is where the weird part starts lol. In short it's game where player comes through vivo exposure therapy to overcome their fears and anxiety. In the good ending player succeed and it represented as coming through light in the tunnel and reuniting with your dog. And that final scene it has such a calming music atmosphere. The player's been to hell and back so this light in the tunnel ending is really awesome. So when I finished it I started to imagine myself as that player. I've been through such a lot of things and I am trying my best to manage so it gives me that tiny spark of hope that after all universe will give me a break. Maybe things'll get better and maybe just maybe I could finally make baby steps towards my dreams without my avpd being triggered so much. Thanks for listening to me ,Personality-disorder

I don't even have the motivation to try to do it anymore. But it makes me sad when even other socially malfunctioning people thrive in niche communities and I can't.

51260,Sometimes I feel like I don't actually exist like I'm a ghost of sorts. Does anyone else know this feeling? I don't speak to anyone most days. Just my mom and dad sometimes my sister. When I do speak my voice sounds all weird because of the lack of practice. It's kinda funny because I've noticed that despite being fluent in English it's my second language but I've studied it since I was a kid sometimes I forget how to speak it properly. Sometimes I say things that don't make grammatical sense or I don't pronounce words correctly. Idk why this is happening. Maybe because I rarely speak with other people that aren't my parents. No one ever notices me. In school it doesn't matter if I sit on the back or all the way on the front no one ever talks to me and I don't talk to anyone. I haven't had a meaningful relationship of any kind with anyone in literal years. The last friend I ever had was when I was 12. I'm 23 now. I spent all high school sitting by myself behind a tree. Even now in college I'm by myself. I rarely leave my house. It's so fucking pathetic but I just can't make friends. I don't relate to anyone. I don't feel comfortable around anyone.

In the past 6 years I have left my house like twenty times. I'm driven by AvPD and have very poor hygiene due to selfneglect and depression. I'm not skilled in anything not particularly intelligent either definitely not physically gifted and absolutely hideous.try to get a normal life with that background lol. I feel worthless I have so much shame against myself it sounds so hard. For the first time I want to find a way out and not rot in my room for the first time I have ambitions. It's so hard.

When I tell her I want to make new connections with strangers she tells me that makes no sense and why don't I hang with family..She doesn't get it when I say family scares me more than strangers. With strangers there's much less at stake. They don't know shit about you you don't know shit about them and if something goes wrong you never have to speak to them again. It's one and done. She also didn't understand why I wanted to work retail I don't anymore for different reasons now. She asked me how can I talk to strangers yet I'm too scared to talk to family. She doesn't understand that I just do better in work or education based settings..You don't have to get into your personal life that much and once the day is over you go home and don't have to talk to them. There's not much expectations because they're your classmatescoworkers. You don't have to let them know too much about youMy mom just doesn't get it and I hate talking to her about anything at all because she gives me over simplistic solutions and lowkey makes me feel bad for having these issues when she's part of the reason why I have it in the first place. As an adult it's my responsibility to fix this but i know what my threshold is I'm tired of her acting like she knows me better than I know myself and she told me she knows me better than I know myself.,Personality-disorder

So. Fucking. Scared.This isn't anything O new situation fear no I've been to the museum once or twice and know the people I know the community. But I am so damn fucking scared of rejection. I am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me. I am scared of the social aspects of it.I keep getting these thoughts of they'll think I'm a creep I'll probably never keep up with it because I am a pathetic good for nothing lower to everyone else.It's hurting me. And I need advice on how to just keep going what should I do once it starts? Fight through the thoughts and fears?It was already hard enough as it was to do the paper now I'm crashing wondering What the fuck was I thinking!? But I'm trying to keep positive as much as I possibly can. This could be a mix of social anxiety and AVPD running it's course but I don't know all I know is that I am scared and very fearful of the future of people of being seeing in public of messing up big time.Any words of encouragement or advice will help a lot.

51273,Went to school today to get a confirmation that I will be dropping out principal scoffed at my situation. My teacher already told me that it's impossible for me to continue the next semester. I already know that but she told me it needs to come from the principal itself for confirmation. So we went to him just for the confirmation. Now the principal went on and on about me coming to him begging for a second chance... Which i didn't. I just went there for a confirmation. I already know they're not gonna give me a second chance. I didn't come there to beg.He then went on about how I don't really have anxiety because if I do have anxiety I would have found a way apparently he knows because he has anxiety too. The thing is I DON'T HAVE ANXIETY. AVOIDANT PERSONALITY DISORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM ANXIETY. He then said I'm just making excuses and I just got lazy. I'm not asking them for second chances I know right from the start they are not gonna accept me anymore but I don't appreciate them making fun of my shitty mental health. That's the thing with this disorder we literally avoid things to the point where it affects our whole life. He was acting like i went to his office crying and kneeling down begging to give me a second chance he said I know why you came here to ask for a second chance when I literally just sat in front on his desk and agreed that they can't give me another chance. I wouldn't have come if I knew he was gonna make fun of my disorder. I only came because my teacher said it needed to come from him for it to be final. Now everyone thinks I'm just making shit up. It also doesn't help that my country doesn't have a GED. I wonder what their faces would look like if I killed myself? Wouldn't it be funny?

51275,What should I do if I strongly suspect AvPD? I've struggled with mentalemotional problems pretty much all my life. Even as a young kid I was very shy and anxious. That morphed into more severe problems as I became a teenyoung adult.Now at almost 30 I'm really frustrated because nothing gets better for me. Doctors keep trying to treat me for depression or anxiety or ADHD which I do have problems with but it seems like there are more fundamental deeply set issues which go unaddressed. I've been interested in psychology since I was a teen and there have been times where I've considered that I might have AvPD before forgetting about it but recently I began researching this in earnest and pretty much every diagnostic criterion strongly fits me. It's kind of scary how well it describes me and how much the posts in this sub reflect my thoughts amp experiences.Where should I go from here? How can I bring this up with my psych or should I bring it up? Would getting a diagnosis be worth it?,Personality-disorder
51276,Splitting ? in AvPD?? 18F just a disclaimer I havent been formally diagnosed yet but I relate to AvPD in so many ways that I cant dive into right now. I relate way more to AvPD than social anxiety but of course idk for sure.But anyway I was wondering if people with just AvPD experience something like splitting that occurs in BPD after feeling like someones rejected them or criticised them.For example I was having a job interview and the people interviewing me seemed really nice and I really really liked them but as the interview went on I felt like their body language and tone of voice showed they were criticising and judging me. After I felt that its like a switch flicked and I hated them. Absolutely hated them. I was so mad internally and all I could think of was how mean they were even tho they literally didnt do anything. I was so angry and I just wanted to break down and cry because I also hated myself too for embarrassing myself and looking weird and ruining my chance to get hired.Anyway I got the job and I love them again and cant even imagine ever hating them. This sort of thing happens to me all the time with almost everyone in my life and its so confusing!!! Except I thought it was only a BPD thing or could it be a mix of both or complex PTSD??Does anyone else experience this often too?Also Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist really soon and Im not self diagnosing,Personality-disorder
51277,Feeling like a creep in publicon public transport So I've had this for a long time but only now have I sort of grasped why I feel like this.Whenever I'm outside and especially in closed off public transport like the subway I'll feel like a creep because I just stare and analyze everyone and everything. The reality is that when I get anxious I get hyperaware of everything and everyone around me and when I start starting at strangers analyzing every bit of their appearanceclothingpostureetc I start feeling like a creep. Only recently have I realized that the being hyperaware is where the feeling of being a creep comes from vs just organically. With me being less anxious lately I'm more able to just stare off into the distance and distract myself with my thoughts and then suddenly I don't feel so inadequateweird anymore.I know I've thought about this before and even said it to someone that when my anxiety takes over I literally can't think of anything but the present situation. I'll literally start brainstorming ideas to think about so I can distract myself from what's in my face that second.Just felt like typing this out and sharing maybe someone can relate.Much love,Personality-disorder

It just scares me that every time I open my mouth I risk saying something wrong and being hated. I don't know how to be 'correct' or say the right things and be liked.

Not only would I be kicked out but I also wouldnt have a school to go to as I cant function in a regular school setting.

I'm 18 and up until about 6 months ago I was convinced I was completely unlovable. I didn't come from such a great home and I was bullied for all of elementary school. All I've been told for all my life is that I am worthless ugly disgusting and just a horrible person. But then I met a guy that made me feel loved like I deserved to be loved for the first time in my life. We dated for 6 months then he broke up with me because I have a personality disorder. I never told him I'm diagnosed with AvPD and BPD because even though he told me he would always love me I was afraid that if he knew about my disorders he'd break up with me. Turns out I was right. Because I finally decided to tell him about a week ago 2 days later he texted me and basically said that he wants to end this. He said he didn't want to be together with someone with borderline. I asked if I did something wrong but he said he just didn't want the drama. I know I didn't do anything wrong I never did anything to hurt him. But just because I've been through shit he doesn't want to love me. The rational part of me knows he's being an asshole but the BPDAvPD part of me wants me to think that I'm the asshole. Was he right not to love me? Am I really that horrible? I don't know what to do. I feel completely worthless no one will ever love me and I shouldn't ever leave my house again. I deserve this.

51283,Does anyone know if AVPD would qualify for MAID in Canada when it opens to Mental Health conditions? In March Medical assistance in dying is opening up for people with conditions causing unbearable pain physical or mental they do not have to life threatening. httpswww.ontario.capagemedicalassistancedyingandendlifedecisionshttpswww.ontario.capagemedicalassistancedyingandendlifedecisionsI've gone over this at least a hundred times like tonight even if I get approved they have a new 90 day minimum waiting period so it will be a while regardless. I have to time to think which leads to all fun ideas of Wiley coyote jumping off my balcony and hitting the concrete awning over the front entrance 12 stories might kill ol' Wiley maybe or leave him in agonizing pain wishing for death. Imagine holding that little sign up to the camera but it's a little suicide note saying goodbye to no one. HahaBut I'm pretty confident I'm going to get approved I meet very criteria I've tried all the required mental health options counselling therapy community services etc. I don't have any psychological supports I am alone. That's more than half the reason I want to go this condition this brain it makes it so I will always be alone. The loneliness knowing you can never and never will escape you'll avoid every chance you have. But the pain doesn't have to be forever I don't have to keep suffering and if I don't get approved jokes on them. I don't need approval to kill myself I just know I'm going to fuck it up anyway. Ending up with my ankles snapped off trying to crack my skull open on the concrete but too fucking weak to get the pressure. I couldn't do it if I tried not because I don't want too. I want too I want too so bad that's why I'm applying for Maid but I need to do it. But I will fail because I always fail. I'll avoid because i always avoid. I'll pity myself and feel bad and get fucked up and cry and hurt myself and tomorrow will happen and my credit card will get more maxed out and death will come knocking again saying TODAY IS THE DAY DO IT DO IT FUCKING DO IT PLEASE DO IT. Constantly. That's my brain thousands of times a day screaming kill yourself. I love saying slit your wrists over and over again. Making tea I should slip my fucking wrists dum dum dum please slit your wrists. I don't even have a good knife I just say it for some reason to myself. I'm way less scared of cutting that jumping I am terrified of fucking that up. Damn Hamilton's and our slow trains lmao. That was the way I wanted to go when I was trying to do it as a teenager. The trains back home damn they were fast knock your fucking head off in one go. Instant. There were always Roses taped to the Red sign beside the opening. A lot of people had the same idea as me so at least you know it works right!But you can always fuck it up the fear that causes avoidance affects suicide too! I can't do it if I wanted to just like everything else in life I want to do. So if I just need to get approved get passed 90 days... ahh I'm fucked lmao.

51287,Old Friendships Past Due Date? I'm pretty much completely alone. My family is mostly dead and the rest no contact. I'm f42 divorced no kids and I just ended a three year post marriage relationship that was pretty toxic. I have two best friends since High School. We've known each other over 25 years and we used to be inseparable. We all had family issues so we became our own family. They both moved out of state at least 15 years ago so the majority of our friendship is on the phone and we maybe visit each other once or twice a year. My last relationship which lasted three years really got in the way of our friendships. My boyfriend was so clingy I could never call my friends because he wouldn't leave me alone for a minute. That's a whole other unhealthy issue I can't get into. Lol. But as an avoidant person it drove me crazy. Anytime I had the chance to be alone without my boyfriend the last thing I wanted to do was call my friends. I needed alone time. I did try to break up with him several times. He even moved out a few times but kept coming back. I finally broke up with him for good about six months ago. Anyway I understand why they are reluctant to just go back to the way things were in our friendship. I don't blame them for being upset with me and I fully plan to try my best to make it up to them and I'm grateful that they are willing to talk to me at all but... I'm not sure I like them anymore. We've been friends for so long. I seriously don't have anyone else in my life and I am afraid I am just doing the avoidant thing and looking for reasons to write them out of my life. I've done that with everyone else in my life but these two always seemed special and I feel like we've known each other so long they are family and I want to always know them but they aren't really being good friends anymore. I know people grow apart and I admit that I am the one who stopped talking as much initially and like I said I was and am more than prepared to make up to them the fact that I haven't been around but honestly I wasn't around because I was in a toxic relationship and I told them that every time I did get a chance to talk to them. I talked about how I was stuck for financial reasons and covid and that I was losing my mind to never be alone and they didn't help me. They didn't encourage me to get out or give me advice they just got more and more distant and now that I am broken up they tell me this guy was bad for me but they wouldn't tell me that when we were together and that's what I needed to hear from them. Instead they just acted like they liked my bf and talked bad about both of us to each other. I hate to say but it almost feels like they were enjoying me being in a bad relationship. Maybe I'm just paranoid. They say they forgive me but they don't talk to me very much. One really doesn't call me or answer me and the other calls all the time but I'm not allowed to talk about my relationship at all. He has hung up on me twice for even mentioning it. I get that he doesn't like my ex but neither do I and I was in a toxic relationship for three years I need to talk some of it through. I would never do that to them and god knows I have had to listen to some boring andor stupid problems of theirs repeatedly over the years. Why can't they do that for me?I know people out grow each other. They have made new friends and I need to as well but it's hard for me because well I have avpd. Ideally I would like to keep them as friends and make new friends that understand more about the person I am now instead of the person I was in high school. But the part of me that pushes people away wants to push them out and I don't know what to do?Do they get to treat me bad because I wasn't as accessible to them for a while? I was never completely gone I just couldn't be there as much. Do they get points for being friends with me so long? Should I just over look it?Or am I right that they are being disrespectful by telling me what I can or can't talk about hanging up on me if I mention something they don't like talking to each other and excluding me even if they are talking about coming into town and staying with me even when they are not invited? I have to work and they are on vacation but please come stay at my house and expect me to drop everything to do what you want? We never do what I want when they come to visit because I live here so I have to be on board to do everything they want to do.I know it's a long story. There is a lot more to it too but am I blowing things out of proportion and prematurely ending my longest and only friendships ? Or has the time apart from them given me clarity to see who they really are which is bossy and disrespectful of me and I should just try and make new friends that don't judge me so harshly like talking and listening to me and actually live in my town? TLDR I have had a hard life and I want to stand up for myself. But it's leaving me completely alone. Am I cutting out my friends too quickly?,Personality-disorder

51289,socializing in public has the same feeling of walking into an employee only area in stores I'm sure you've seen those doors with the warning signs that say it's not meant for customers at establishments. Socializing with avpd feels I'm walking into one of those employee only areas. That same sense of urgency knowing that I don't belong there and I need to get out before something bad happens..,Personality-disorder
51290,I wish they made a film centred around an avoidant character Ive struggled to find any kind of media where the protagonist specifically struggles with avoidance. I really enjoyed Amelie and resonated a lot with the character but feel that she could more easily be seen as struggling with ASD or even just extreme shyness introversion. I dont know about anyone else but seeing characters I identify with in films or in novels brings me a lot of comfort. It kind of brings awareness to those traits and humanises people and has the ability to shift the audiences perspective on those issues. Maybe if we had more coverage in the mainstream we wouldnt feel as defective or alien.Id love seeing an avoidant main character and having people really understand how severe this disorder can be and how overlooked it is. It could be painful and raw showing how damaging isolation can be yet how there appears to be no alternative. But it could also have light moments and laughoutloud moments and show how people suffering with this disorder have light inside them despite everything. I also think its important that the character be shown to be relatively attractive intelligent good work ethic etc. I think a large part and maybe the most tragic of this PD is that we view ourselves as less than we are. Almost like we have conditioned ourselves to not value anything about us even if that value is present. I think people should see how the issue is deep rooted and its not as simple as improving things like wealth appearance or even social skills. Im curious what other people think would be important to include in a film centred on a character with AvPDAlso this song would definitely make an appearance imohttpsyoutu.bewDLA5ZFQLbs,Personality-disorder

51293,things change I've been in an episode of complete isolation for about 3yrs but doing my best to claw myself out. With a therapist's encouragement I reached out to the person I love more than anything who I've been in love with for years and she full of grace and compassion accepted me back. But she is in a relationship now. I told myself that this was likely and that I would be okay with it but I don't think I am. I feel sick to my stomach and haven't stopped crying. How can I be a good friend when it's so painful to talk to her when all the advice says that to get over unrequited love you should distance yourself when that's exactly what I'm trying NOT to do? I can't hurt her again by distancing myself without explaining why but I can't tell her how I feel because that would be disrespectful of her relationship. I've completely ruined everything I deserve the pain I'm feeling but I still can't cope with it. It sounds like it's new. If I'd been able to reach out even a few months earlier I might have been able to tell her. Now I feel like I've lost my one and only chance to be happy. I'm so selfish and stupid. I don't know what to do. I hate myself so much.,Personality-disorder
51295,everyone stares and judges you leaving the house is so difficult because no matter where i am i can feel like every single person is staring at me and making fun of me or judging me. when i walk outside i can feel the stares from everyone in their cars. when im on a bus i can feel the eyes of every single person on the bus. even when i just get out of my house i feel like the whole neighbourhood is staring at me. i know ive been experiencing this for a long time. definitely since i was a teenager i grew my hair out so that it can cover a lot of my face because i felt like people were doing that. my first memory of having anxiety i was 6 and i was late to school and was too afraid to walk in the class because everyone would look at me. it took me 10 mins just to walk in and then because of that my teacher yelled at me in front of the class. i would feel sick before presentations in elementary school and didnt know why. any kind of attention on me scares the living shit out of me. i dont know if this is avpd or not but it causes me so much distress. it doesnt help that i didnt leave my house for many years and was agoraphobic.,Personality-disorder

51297,how are some people able to not care so much? if they miss work if theyre late to an event if someone or other is upset with them some people dont let that shit get them down. but for me it turns into a selfhating spiral of why I cant function.do you relate to holding onto and beating yourself up for small personal failures?while Im here I have one other question. I notice my emotions and my reaction to my emotions is extremely dependent on my immediate environment. that is to say I dont take discomfort well at all. I dont cope with thoughts like it will be over soon next time wont be so bad because I cant get myself out of the suffering of the here and now. for my life this makes working hard which makes money hard which lends itself to the spiral of worthlessness.I abuse dissociative drugs for this reason its the only possible way to escape the reality of the present which is often uncomfortable. the dxm actually not only pulls me away but allows me to see things objectively and see the beauty and humor in life how small I am and how big everything else is things like that.I dont mean to derail I know its not a drug sub. but so do you find your emotions to be a direct reaction of the environment around you so much so that you cant avoid them and spend much of your life actively suffering like me?sorry if this post is stupid and if you do.,Personality-disorder

51302,I can't tell if I'm jealous of other people I think I like my life when I am alone. I am happy to be by myself do my work and my chores and I have hobbies that bring me joy. But it feels as if it all comes crashing down and a heavy sense of depression and grief hangs over me as soon as I'm reminded that other people do fun things together. I don't want to join them because most of the time having fun with friends isn't actually fun for me but the feeling persists and can go on for days. I know it's silly to feel resentful of these other people and it makes me resentful towards myself as well. I just want to make it stop. Ex driving my sister who is still in high school to hang out with her friends or go on dates. I'm only a year older than her and afterwards suddenly my existence is in a different focus and I remember that objectively it is very dreary that the most exciting thing I have done in a month is watching my spinach sprouts grow.,Personality-disorder
51303,hi HiI'll start by saying I've been diagnosed with AvPD about 2 years ago around the end of my military service but it's something I've dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a 22 years old still. I'm seeing a therapist for the better part of 2 years now and it helps mainly mentally not physically yet as I'm not doing much spending all my days at home no friends no social life no nothing. I did get a job last week which I'm starting next week 4 hours a day cleaning some school buildings 5 minutes from my house.But as the time goes I find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff I'd like to do like traveling the world and studying I even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like 3 days before the semester started. Since then I'm daydreaming about traveling going to south america or something..Last week I said screw it and booked a ticket to Barcelona for a trip with my mom and sister. I was very excited as I'm a big FC Barcelona fan for years but as we all know something has to go wrong. We're supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days I had in the last couple of years. I feel like I just wanna disappear until Friday arrives when the trip is over. I feel like it's a task someone is commanding me to finish and not something I ever wanted to do. It took me some time cause I usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister and now they're thinking whether they should cancel or go and they're waiting for my desicion. I also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didn't know like how I don't talk to my 2 friends anymore or how before I got this poor job I was sending CV's and when people would call me I couldn't pick up the phone. I told her that I feel lonely even when I'm with them my family cause while they do make me feel good they can't cover up for my nonexistent social life.Seriously I feel like a mess I roam around feeling down like I've never felt before I think. Just want to vent a little ,Personality-disorder

51310,Want to resign from my job Hey all Im really struggling at the moment and all I can think about is resigning from my role. Im a social worker who provides therapy to childrenadolescents with complex mental health difficulties. Ive been working at the organisation for 11 months now and roughly a week ago I changed my workplace location to be closer to home. Its the same service just a different location. Oh .. and Im acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment. I thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident however Im still feeling like an imposter scared and worried about criticism. Extremely terrified of social interactions too. Just knowing I have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety. Im also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but I still dread the work that I have to do.All I keep thinking about is waking up in the morning switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach pretending I have no responsibilities or cares in the world. I know thats not possible though.If I did resign I would make sure never to find a therapy role again as its not something Im too keen on and social interactions terrify me. Should I keep trying to work in spite of the anxiety I experience? I think Ive given it a fair shot and I cant take it anymore! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. thanks!,Personality-disorder

Growing up having my parents always telling me I'm intelligent and making a big deal of it always getting good grades and whatever my ego takes such a huge hit when I lose again and again and again. I feel so stupid. I ended up asking him if he would walk me through his moves while we play chess so I can have clear examples of how to apply different strategies. It was maybe the most ashamedpathetic I have ever felt. I feel a bit better now but fuck I just want to be able to have fun with him.

51315,Entitled People I had a guy cut in front of me and another woman at the self checkout line today. It made me feel ashamed as if I seemed weak or pathetic or maybe just a woman and thats why he felt entitled to just do that as if he was sure I wouldnt say anything. And I didnt because I guess I didnt feel angry enough to care. Anyone else experience shit like this? Wondering if youre sending Im a doormat vibes. Because in reality I avoid relationships because Im strong enough to know Id never want to be walked all over but too guilty to get into relationships that are really about my desires and boundaries. If that makes sense. I avoid because I know Im too scared to own who I am but Im unwilling to be with other people and be codependent. So Im alone. Stuck needing to figure out having the strength to let myself find the people that genuinely meet my needs.The funny thing about this though is that when my time came to checkout i still got out of the self checkout faster than him even though we had the same amount of stuff,Personality-disorder

51317,How do you feel about becoming a parent while having AvPD? I'm going through a horrible situation with my reproductive health. Until the point of having to get treatment for conceiving and all as my tests are showing I don't have much time left for postponing getting pregnant. The thing is that at 25 my recently diagnosed avpd has destroyed me. Even though I have a career I'm financially stable and got to organize my life a bit. I don't have quality of life. I'm so anxious I can't even function worried about what the neighbors around my apartment might think of me. I still leave the house for going to work but sometimes I'm so freaking exhausted I cannot take care of myself. And I can't stop but wonder if becoming a parent would be a good idea for me or if it will be better to forget about it as I seem to be a person who doesn't fit into the scheme of a good parent. I used to dreamed about having babies back when i was younger but now i think that would be the most egotistical decision i could ever takespecially for a child that didn't ask to be born or have a trashy parent like me who cannot even go to the supermarket alone.,Personality-disorder

I self isolate and only go outside for shopping to get a quick bite to eat. I made improvements in talking to employees of restaurants or at grocery stores but I still have a fear of interacting with others and Im always thinking about the chance of being judged and so keep to myself.

51326,How old is everyone here? Just out of curiosity I wonder what age groups are most prominent on this sub. 019 2029 3039 4049 50 and up.I cant help but wonder if this age of technology caused this disorder to become so prominent. People seem to have lost the ability or have never learned how to socialize with our faces buried into a phone computer game etc.Nobody communicates in person like in the past when people were forced to. If there was a function you had to show up to find out who was there. Maybe Im wrong but Im curious. It just feels like technology has sadly created a world of introverts or has contributed to it. Anyone agree? ,Personality-disorder
51327,How did you get a therapist andor an official diagnosis? I've decided to finally take action and try and get some kind of diagnosis so I'm not just relying on my internal monologue or the internet to deal with this thing.I tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didn't go great. After one too many what's the worst that could actually happen? questions I just really felt like they didn't understand. This was before I had the term AVPD to explain.My question is this How did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem?My guess is I'm being a bit too inmyhead about this but I just don't want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into WebMD and now is 100 sure of their condition. But I also get the impression AVPD isn't as common as some other personality disorders so I want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it. But nothing shows up when I search for therapists who specialize in it directly. Are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist? Should I just focus on a depressionanxiety doc or maybe one who works with other PDs like BPD? Or am I way off base and plenty of therapists will understand and just had a bad match for my first goaround?Any suggestions or anecdotes for finding the right kind of help are welcome. Thanks in advance!,Personality-disorder

It's not getting better it's just getting worse everyday. During the day I'm ok but at night when I'm alone and have no distractions I feel scared and anxious. I realize I'm alone and I'll most likely always be alone. I can't be around people when I'm like this I self isolate even harder when I'm hurting. There's a really bad feeling in my stomach rn I feel so strange. I think there's something wrong with me. I'm not good enough in anything. I'm legitimately the worst human being to exist. Why tf am I still here none of this ends well. I'm just so tired n even when I sleep I wake up tired. I wanna escape this but I don't know how. I can't do this. I'm not worthy of existing. Fuckin hell I think about dying most days but I don't want to. I really wanna live a happy life with people in it. But there's so much I can't control. My brain is always trying to fuck me over.

I also hate pretty much everyone I'm jealous of and I want to wipe them out. I want to take everything they have. No not just a single one but all of them. Because all that's theirs is mine. I want everyone who doesn't fall to my wrath to be scared of me. To pray for my mercy. To spend every waking hour thanking me for letting them live.

51333,I think my social phobia is causing my job hunt procrastination I've been made redundant from my last 3 jobs the last one being extremely traumatic. I've had many extremely close friendships end. I was abused and bullied my entire childhood by peers and family. Now I can barely look people in the eye and can't say hello or respond to small talk in work environments because it induces so much anxiety about being hated and misunderstood. I avoid textingresponding to messages because people used to say I was annoying and replied too much. If we're looking at the evidence everything points to me being a fundamentally unlikeable and hated person. I used to be fantastic at short bursts of social interactions but smoked cannabis non stop to be able to do so. People liked my stoneddrunk persona more than sober me and now that I'm sober I feel utterly terrified of interacting with anyone. I can't even answer the door for food deliveries. I need a job to be able to afford medical treatment but I always get stuck at the cover letter aspect because I feel like as soon as people get to know me they start to hate me. Most of my work experience has been in customer service or sales based roles but I hated every role I've ever done. I dedicated my academic years to studying medicine and law but had to drop out of uni to heal some trauma and I haven't returned since. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone and stuck and my rejection sensitivity is through the roof.

51337,therapy with avpd does it even work? ive been in and out of therapy since i was 13. thats half my life. ive seen psychologists psychiatrists social workers and counsellors ive been through CBT DBT goal focused therapy grief therapy. ive been on so many medications. ive never been allowed myself to become unstable enough to be hospitalized and ive been able to be the bare minimum functional and composed enough to fly under the radar of more intense interventions. when it comes to therapy i have a severe problem with trusting my therapists failing to disclose what i really need help with struggling to express my true thoughts worrying excessively about judgement and criticism and leaving therapy after the initial hope of this one will be what helps dies out likely because of aforementioned problems. in march 2020 i was diagnosed with bpd but for reasons it was march 2020 i never got it addressed but now that i have insurance that covers most of the cost of sessions i want to try again. im paying some out of my own pocket too and i dont know if its even worth it due to my history with therapy i sent in a general inquiry to a private office close to me and they referred me to a male therapist which terrifies me as ive only had female therapists before and who uses a different approach psychodynamic therapy which is again fucking terrifying.i want to ghost and just not do this so badly and im just fighting against myself arranging two 2 emails is exhausting and fucking nervewracking and i dont even know if this is going to go anywhere. i dont even know if im asking for advice or just venting but thanks for reading anyway,Personality-disorder

51342,Can't even show up for my own life and do the activities I wanna do. Honestly don't know where to go from here. Existence is completely wasted on me. I have grouporiented activities I want to join yet I just can't do it...I can't even risk social rejection or ridicule. I'm currently in Thailand on a sixweek trip with my partner and child. While that sentence doesn't exactly sound like it puts me in the category of avoidant personality disorder I am one of the most avoidant people on Earth. I spent three years at university and only ever talked to about four people none of whom I developed friendships with. I've spent my entire adult life working remotely alone at home so that I can avoid any work environment that requires socializing. Even my relationship is pretty lowquality we don't exactly sit down and have lengthy interesting conversations every day.But perhaps even worse still there are various grouporiented activities I'd love to try that would bring value to my life and I can't at all bring myself to do them. One example is muay Thai. I signed up for a class yesterday arrived at the gym and turned back at the entrance. This has happened several times. And it's a consistent theme in my adult life whether the activity is a martial art soccer or a hiking meetup. Basically I can't show up for my own life and do the activities that I value. I'm not really living and never really have. I'm now 32 years old FFS close to middleaged. I'm almost certain I'll be dead before 35...what a waste of a human I am.,Personality-disorder
51345,Just a question. Hello I wonder. How many people on this subreddit are diagnosed with avpd. In my case it started with social anxiety 20 years ago. Tried a lot of things nothing helped me so I gave up. I was on healthcare all that time. I still am. My untreated social anxiety evolved in all these years into avpd. Just a question.. Cause when I hear my friends say.. I have anxiety also.. But they're having a normal life. It's tiring hearing and reading such things. It feels like no one understands what it really is... having avpd.For me it started long time ago after having meningitis. Now after 20 years looking for answers this is upsetting to hear. My doc never told anything about it. He was my doc since I was a kid. This makes me mad. He ignored all these things. He knew everything about me but never made the connection with meningitis. My mental state when I left the hospitral the trauma...he ignored it all. I'm hearing this fromy parents know. How traumatized I was. My doc blamed me when I was using things trying to handle my anxiety and depression. Judging me for everything. I'm discovering this all now 30 years later. It's a shame. He's total ignorent. Not my doc anymore but i wanted to send a e mail to him.. Wanting answers...cause discovering this now is making me mad at my doc that knew me for 30 years. No one ever made the connection with meningitis. It wasn't written in any report. When I was reading story's of other people..I felt guilt. Thinking... But my youth was good... I'm just a crybaby.. Wanting attention. Finally 30 years later i'm getting answers. Way to late. If i have knew this decades ago.. My psychiatrists therapist.. My life would be maybe different now. My new doc and psychiatrist are saying this...why didnt anyone knew about this. They don't understand. Maybe times have changed. But it makes me made inside.,Personality-disorder
51346,Having no romantic relationships or prospects for one is eating away at me I am 24M and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind not even crushes. I lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff. I've never even had female friends except some cousins.I live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. I'm nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious especially for women. But I don't see myself ever getting married. I'll probably KMS before 30.It feels like I will miss out on this part of the human experience because I'm so insecure around women. I saw a post that summarised how I feel perfectlygtI have trouble talking to women in fact I can't even make eye contact with them especially if I find them even a little attractive. I'm scared they'll think I like them and then they'll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them.I know that going into a relationship won't fix me but it's so gut wrenching knowing that you don't have the skills or prospects that can make it possible. It's stopping me from even trying to make friends with women IF they think I like them they'll probably be disgusted by me. Even though I'm scared to even let myself think that I might like someoneI know that I should try to make friends with women first but I'm afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women let alone having female friends or a relationship. It's like I carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and I automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it.Is there anyone out here who knows what this is like?,Personality-disorder
51347,no wonder i over monitor myself What's with people calling you out and putting your mannerisms on the spot? People I know make comments on my body movements or how I talk and it pisses me offYou eat so little like a cat why do you take such small bites? how you hold your phone looks funny why do you shake your legs? Why do you talk like that? Why do you laugh like that?. Or imitating how I walk talk or move to be funny. I don't get how it's funnyIt makes me insecure about every little thing I do. I noticed how they don't do this to other people that often it's mostly me. I sometimes end up being really stiff and monotone because I feel like I'm going to be called out for EVERY little thing I do,Personality-disorder

51352,This is how I took care of my AVPD As someone who has highfunctioning anxiety and AVPD I really found it hard to develop relationships and take them to the next level. I never had problems talking to strangers and I was just able to easily go about my day unless I am met with familiar faces. I still study at a university and I've tried to invest more effort in socialising but to no surprise I wasn't making any progress despite exerting more of my resources for 6 months straight.I thought I was at a dead end. So I just gave up. I turned into this halfdead human who didn't give a fuck about anyone anymore. It felt good for a few weeks but all throughout those days I had this lingering feeling that whatever the hell I was doing was wrong. My rebellious phase eventually ended but I was still tired of trying to socialise.Ladies and gentlemen if I asked you what your next step here is what would it be?You see us AVPD folks are subconsciously feeling guilty and ashamed of ourselves because we assume and feel like we are not enough for the people we want to build relationships with. Take my advice andLet us be and feel human for a change. Everyone is imperfect so don't put up a face or please people because you are enough.Humbling myself was the first thing I did. As I was burntout from even trying to socialise I stayed put and just became me for a change I committed whenever I felt like it. There is no secret code no secret formula no secret anything to socialising you just experience the moment and live life at the present. Take good example from your childhood brain where times where simpler because we still had no idea of the norms and society's symbols. If you humble yourself and accept and approach every situation with humility and nonchalance you will find peace this is the power of kindness this is where the healing process of loving and respecting yourself begins.Going back to my story for the first time ever in 7 years I felt peace. Peace with everything. I don't want to forcefully strive myself to socialise with my peers because that is fake shit. Be of no responsibility. Do take note that I've seen big improvements in building relationships! Of course I was committing from time to time whenever I felt like it.So ladies and gents don't try to divert the river of life because the water will deliver you to where you need to go.Feel free to DM me if you want more about how I remedied my AVPD. Peace!,Personality-disorder

51355,the irony of it all I recently got diagnosed with AvPD after probably struggling with it for 8 years I thought downloading reddit would give me some kind of comfort as there are communities on certain topics on here that are easily accessible but as Im reading through posts I have zero desire to comment on anything or make any connection at all and exited the app with the thought of probably never replying to anything which is the irony of it all. But I do wanna let you know of my existence I will probably not ask questions or share details of my disorder but I still exist and I still have a voice and fingers to type. Im real even if it sometimes doesnt feel that way. Thanks for reading..,Personality-disorder

Social anxietys a bitch but what really gets to me is how Ill tear myself apart afterwards. I cant let myself forgive or forget even the slightest fuck ups. Every stutter wrong word choice thinking I said something mean or dumb etc. It doesnt matter if I did perfectly fine Ill find something to criticize. I tell myself Im an idiot that Im inferior that whoever I was talking to would be better off if I said nothing or if I wasnt alive.I know that these are normal things that people dont remember and usually dont judge but I cant get it through my fucking head.

51363,Dae have a job where they are around a lot of people? My job is at a very fast paced restaurant with a large amount of staff. I work hard because of the pain of being clearly the only one who hasnt formed any friendships. I think my coworkers are great people and there are so many but I cant hold a conversation with anyone. Its even worse if I liked them when I first met them. There are specific shifts I want more of because I like the work better but in those situations I feel bad for whoever has to work around my quiet self. And When I speak I sound confident but I cant have conversations per se. People thought I was normal for maybe a few weeks and then gave up. Im not being mistreated but its lonely. Im 28 and age 27 was the last year I was able to form relationships. I have a bf now but I know that when he leaves me eventually Ill never be able to start anything over.

51364,People don't take this disorder seriously enough. They're acting like we're just doing this to be lazy. It's not our fault our brains are like this. My birth giver is nagging and cussing me out for not going to school I understand that this could be frustrating for a parent but I already told her about my problem with going to school I risked that knowing that she's narcissistic and judgemental but even after all the explanations she still thinks going to school for me is easy. She then goes on to say kids these days are so onion skinned which means someone who has shallow tears and then goes on and say I didn't spoil you kids.Didn't it ever occur to her that maybe I'm like this because she abused us as children? That she screams at us every chance she gets? That she didn't treat us with respect and neglected us? It's not just kids these days people have been battling with mental health for hundreds of years it's just popular now because people actually value mental health now and are seeking for help.It's so funny because she acts so caring and worried when talking to my teacher but then acts so judgemental and close minded when talking to me.,Personality-disorder

NOTHING MORE TO SAY HERE. Wipes handsIt's the worst part when it comes from someone you consider a friend. Personally I'd expect friends to know how shit the world is and not give arrogant vague andor obvious advice. Why does EVERYONE do this nowadays?Why is it so hard for you to just shut up and listen to what someone has to say? No one does that. Ever.,Personality-disorder
51366,Acceptance This is a difficult topic to discuss but I'm genuinely curious as to ifhow others have done this and what impact it has had on their lives.The kind of acceptance I'm talking about isn't just an intellectual acknowledgement of having issues. For a long time for example I could say to myself that I'm depressed anxious and struggling to succeed in life at least by metrics of the culture that I reside in. That's relatively easy to do.What I'm speaking of is a shift in perspective where you allow yourself to be disabled and accept living life very differently than what is expected. In doing so you effectively turn off the mechanism that activates masking which exposes vulnerabilities and just say F it I'll deal with the consequences. This means that You accept that you'll be targeted by others misunderstood and often viewed as low status because generally people aren't very understanding of problems that aren't obvious like a physical disability. You accept that you're not likely to be appealingattractive to potential or existing romantic interests. This is particularly salient to men who are selected for traits that showcase an ability to provide. You accept that you'll need emotional financial andor vocational assistance for the remainder of your adult years. As such you must let go of a desire for a fully independent lifestyle. You accept that in all likelihood what you have to say won't hold much value to others outside of a supportive setting. Maybe you didn't have much to say anyways. You accept a humility of attitude and position. You are no longer competing with others in the rat race at least not directly and have no need to get ahead.. and.. You accept that you weren't motivated to do so to begin with. Moving mountains around just isn't your thing. An image comes to mind of a disheveled man holding a sign on the street corner. I imagine there's no pride left to speak of in someone like that. Just acceptance that the world isn't meant for some kinds of people. I know this sounds depressing but this is where I'm at in considering how to proceed with my life. It feels as though I'm flailing around grabbing at the air helplessly in some futile effort to grasp on to an ideal of something I'm not.. a normal selfsufficient person. Just to be clear I don't want to be homeless. I'd hope to do just enough to avoid that. But what this level of acceptance implies is a sense of freedom to be myself as I am in the present moment without fighting it.The idea here is to do something radically different to change my outlook and ease the stress that I'm experiencing. I would guess others here can relate to that stress which is the definition of AvPD.So has anyone taken this journey and would be willing to share some wisdom? Is this kind of acceptance a good idea?Or does anyone want to share their thoughts generally?It's important to add that this isn't a great idea for young folks. This is something you would consider later on after having tried and tried again.,Personality-disorder
51367,I'm literally too awkward for therapy I'm doing CBT and my therapist always asks me what I'm thinking and all I can say is I don't know because my mind always goes blank. I can't articulate my emotions either and don't even know what I want in life.Today we did an exercise where I was supposed to have a conversation between my critical voice and my confident voice. I told her I'm extremely uncomfortable doing it and she said it's fine we don't have to but I wanted to try it anyways. I could think of hundreds of things I hate about myself but not a single thing I liked about myself. It was so awkward sitting there and not saying a positive thing. My therapist even asked me if I'm having any suicidal thoughts afterwards that's how bad I must have looked. When I looked in her eyes she seemed clueless like she's never seen anyone that bad and has no idea how to help me.I don't believe my problems are something I can fix by just changing the way I think about myself. I am not an interesting person. I'm not an attractive person. I just feel like there's nothing of value about me and people find me repulsive.,Personality-disorder

51377,studying makes my AvPD symptoms worse. This might sound really weird as I've never heard about it here or anywhere else but I've noticed that when I make a mental effort especially to learn something new I seem to change my personality and I can't laugh I get surly my mood gets worse. Also I get hypervigilant when I see people on the street I look at them as if I've seen something scary. If I don't study for a week my symptoms improve a lot and I become more sociable and relaxed. ps Studying means being focused for a period of time on trying to absorb some content well as mathematics or philosophy for example. I know that everything I said may sound meaningless or strange but can someone enlighten me or give me some tips? Thank you very much in advance.,Personality-disorder
51378,Going at your own pace I believe some days ago there was a post about being tired of importance of communication skills in life. Now there's kinda similar issue but with the pace that everything's is going with. Just my personal experience I am not speaking for everyone. So last year I quit college cus I couldn't bear stress and deadlines. I was pretty slow to understand and do things that was required professors or whatever they're called sry not sure were pressuring us a lot with all that and so on. I have a job as a stocker now but in about month or so I have to think about other options for studying collegesuniversities just some other field and that honestly makes my stomach twist. It's not about what I want it's about how it'll all go. I'd love to spend my time studying art but I am so afraid of the process. When I think about it I can imagine only flaws and mistakes I'd make. There would be so much things to learn and practice but so little time to do all that. And now to the title. I hate that everything must be spinning crazy like that. If you want to study you must be catching up quickly otherwise it's immediately your one big ass problem and no one is willing to help you with that. It'd so damn cool if there was any way to get education on your own pace so you have enough time for everything. I know it's only in my dreams but I can't stop thinking about it. I am so slow because my brain is so fried after all these years fighting this plague. I don't know maybe it's just me and I am that broken but it's really so sad that I can't normally go towards my dreams. And those fears aren't even irrational same shit happened year ago and I know myself so damn well it couldn't be any way around.

51379,Boyfriend broke up with me over my AvPD I was already thinking about breaking up with him just because AvPD made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didnt necessarily do anything wrong but its still gutwrenching. Im not necessarily heartbroken I just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to I get you have AvPD and you cant help it but its your fault this isnt working out. He was sick of me constantly ghosting him never directly communicating or confronting him about anything and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult.I already feel guilty enough about the way AvPD makes me act without someone I thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways I ruined this for him all of which just so happen to be things I already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me. In situations like this people usually say some shit like its not you its me or go easy on you right?Not to mention one of his reasons was that I was ghosting him while I have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so I genuinely didnt have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond which feels like maybe he shouldve been a tiny bit more understanding of but in terms of the big picture I guess I understand. It still feels like shit though. Ive never been broken up with before and even though I wanted out since the week he first confessed to me I dont know if Ill be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know I was the bad boyfriend and everything I was insecure about I have every right to hate myself for.EDIT After I panicblocked him on all social media he is now anonymously harassing me on Tumblr to confront me about it and generally being very childish and kinda fucked up and creepy so. Maybe I dodged a bullet actually.,Personality-disorder

I feel like the best times for my mental state and relationships with others have been when I've been forced to do things together and have a very regimented schedule and I don't think my current occupation is tenable for much longer. I have a graduate degree in engineering so I was thinking perhaps trying to become an officer although I'm not so confident in my leadership ability. Perhaps for a support role such as intelligence or a pilot or some other more specialized service? I guess as a bonus I've done a lot of milsim activities and hobbies throughout my life so far and I don't really have any relationships or people except my distant parents to tie me down to a specific location.I'm not taking any medication and although I've brought up this disorder to my psychiatrist I haven't received an official diagnosis one way or the other as it's not their policy to label patients.,Personality-disorder

51389,social anxiety vs avpd what do you guys think of the whole debate around whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorders of course we aren't professionals but i think we can still have our own input. i was diagnosed with social anxiety when i was 15 a month after i dropped out of school and became houseboundagoraphobic and because of that i wasnt able to understand the things i was truly struggling nor were the professionals able to understand. when i ended up inpatient for the first time at age 17 i couldnt leave my room until i was forced to wasnt able to talk to other patients or make friends every time i was in hospital or in some sort of program. i had online friends but then i started becoming convinced that they hated me so i ended up ghosting every online friend i had. when i was 18 i discovered what avpd was and i was amazed by how much i related to every single thing about it even more so than i related to the diagnostic criteria of bpd which i was diagnosed with. i brought up the idea of avpd to a psychiatrist last fall and she pretty just said i agree but also mentioned that theres debate on whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder so idek if she changed my diagnosis or not which kinda annoys me but whatever. i just think from what i know about social anxiety is that well its obviously anxiety related so it deals more with anxious thoughts surrounding social activities. avpd to me is more so the innate feelings that you are inept and that there is something deeply wrong with you to the core and thats why nobody likes you therefore you stay alone. i just think they're separate things because not everyone with social anxiety experiences that. let me know what you guys think!,Personality-disorder

I never had the same interests as the other kids around me. Which made me sad because I wanted to but never did Then there's the fact that I couldn't catch on to jokes quickly which made me awkward. My poor attention span and memory made things worse. Sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor like grab something from a shelf and I couldn't follow directions. This happened a lot growing up. People getting frustrated with me or thinking there's something wrong with me because I couldn't follow directions. This evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed. If someone was telling me where to go I'd need a visual. A map or for me to write down their directions because I'll get lost. My short term memory is so bad. I remember my uncle was giving me his phone number we were moving and he had to leave and come back but I needed to be in contact with him. He recited the numbers and I couldn't remember what he said quick enough. I just always felt like I'm slow to process things. I still am. Someone will state a fact about themselves I'll look them in the face and nod like I was listening. But I wasn't so I repeat what they said back to them and they all give me this wtf look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago. Sometimes I forget the things I myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times. Again ending with people giving me this wtf is wrong with her? Look. Yikes. It doesn't help that I think I deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria. It takes very little for me to get flustered and embarrassed. It led to me lashing out at others as a child which ofc led to me being excluded eventually. I always overexpressed my emotions and I think that was off putting to other people. When I was happy I was very happy. When I felt a twinge of sadness I was crying when I was mad I was yelling and name calling.I had overall weird impulsive behavior. I would say the most random things and make really weird movements I still do but only at home lol. I think all of these things just made others reject me because I was so strange. And to avoid the harsh judgement I started masking all of my quirks but I lost myself in the process. I went from one extreme to the other. Instead of being overly expressive I isolate myself and I come off as cold uncaring and stuck up. But this couldn't be further from the truth. I truly do care about people but I'm emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem weird Sorry for all the rants and posts lately . I'm not actually sad this time. I think I'm just coming to accept there's a reason why I am the way I am and that I'm not just inherently defective.,Personality-disorder
51392,Social Media This is gonna sound maybe a little superficial but anyone feel embarrassed posting on social media because of how little friends they have? Like I know a post of mine is only gonna get a few likes and Im almost embarrassed to post because then itll be obvious to those people how alone I am.,Personality-disorder
51393,How to stop ghosting? How to stop ghosting people? There's a point where trust is broken and you're afraid that they despise you. This builds on top of your usual ghosting. I guess ghosting should be stopped when trust is not broken. What works to address this ghosting phenomenon?,Personality-disorder
51394,Do you make selfies? Just found rFaces,Personality-disorder
51395,I don't know why I'm so selfdefeating. I can't help it. I don't avoid people because I'm anxious or embarrassed or ugly or feel unwanted. People try to make connections with me and I shut them down or ghost them. I just refuse the effort. And it's not because it's unwantedI wish I had friends I want to date I imagine what my life would be like if I wasn't me and it looks like a lot of fun. I don't think I'm actually schizoid or anything. I just don't have the drive to improve my life in the ways I know I should.I have never been in a relationship but I have accounts on a couple different dating apps. I put effort into my profiles and then I ignore every message I get. When people try to talk to me in public I usually just walk away. I don't know why. Engaging at all just doesn't seem possible. It feels like writer's block only it's going to ruin my life.It's not like I had a traumatic childhood or anything. I wasn't abused. My parents weren't narcissists. I wasn't even particularly unpopular in school but even back then even in elementary school I would refuse any efforts to hang out outside the classroom. I would never go over to my friend's houses even though my mom always said yes. Most often I wouldn't even tell her I was invited. And then I would feel sad from the isolation lol.I don't really know what the point of this post is. It's more of a rambling vent than anything else. I need to get it off my chest somehow. My family is so confused by my behavior but I can't bring myself to talk to them about it. Somehow it's easier on an anonymous subreddit. I'm not even sure if this is allowed here since I'm not officially diagnosed. When I was 19 I went to a psychiatrist to get treatment for my OCD. I didn't want to but the only other option was killing myself which I wanted to do less. He's the one who brought AvPD to my attention but he didn't give me a diagnosis that day. He wanted me to come back for follow up appointments to narrow things down. I refused. I don't know why.,Personality-disorder
51396,Please help me understand what I went through This is going to be lengthy and ahead of time I want to apologize to anyone this might be sensitive to. It involves an affair and I'm struggling to absolve myself for my part in it and have thought often that I might die of a broken heart over this. I'll begin with the story fully and what I need from all of you is help to see similarities in me that'd make me a BPD sufferer or her or what. I am so mentally screwed up over this that it's been hard to move on. I'm almost 3 months no contact as of right now.The story begins at work. I worked at a rehab facility in a health field. She was at the orientation for our first day and she said later that I'd caught her eye and she'd hoped to talk to me from the very first time she'd seen me. As I began to see her at work she started casually flirting. Once she needed equipment that'd take blood pressure and I said I only had my POX that does HR and SpO2 she replied I want everything with a look. As we began to really talk she revealed she had a husband even though she wore no wedding ring. I thought she was beautiful and she was very observant. Later she said that she noticed me looking at her lips one of the first times we'd spoken. It progressed to innocent things like once I'd said me and a coworker missed her while she'd been off for a week or so. She came up to me later in the shift and excitedly and red in the face said you missed me? When helping a patient up from bed she'd placed her hand firmly over mine as I held onto his walker. Little flirty things like this intrigued me. I know that I should not have proceeded but I could tell that she was unhappy and I did feel like she was truly deserving of more happiness. She was from Moldova and her husband was Russian. They'd been married for I believe 10 years and had a son who was 5 years old. I began to pursue her a little more and wrote lists of things to do nearby that were fun. Although she'd been in the US for 5 years she'd never been to a movie once in that time. I was so sad and just thought this girl needs to experience the lighter side of life. Finally one day we exchanged Instagram information and soon began talking on there. She wasn't quick to reveal too much about herself but was definitely initiating conversation frequently. As we began talking it progressed relatively quickly after a month and a half we were meeting for the first time outside of work. It was around this time that she told me prior to meeting me she'd planned to leave her husband and just be alone. I tried inviting her to a movie but she kept insisting that she wanted to come over to my place. When discussing this she was talking about seating and how we wouldn't be doing anything and all of that. I told her the TV was in my room and all I had in there was my bed. She was kind of trying to say that there could be no contact and all of that. Well within seconds of shutting the door behind her we were making out. For the entire time she was over we made out. She even shook my bedpost when she got into my bed. I know she would have gone all the way if I'd tried. This is when there were things she finally said that shook me a little. She told me she broke up with one guy because he didn't kiss good and stuff like that. She told me eventually that people when she worked at Amazon offered a threesome with her. I have no idea how that conversation even began. She began to sound almost manic with the things she'd say as if I'd freed some mind that was eager to be free. She told me once that she wasn't ready to date older men because she wasn't ready for that. When we ate tacos for the first time she said she was ready to date because I joked that all women like tacos and margs on their dating profiles. She told me there were times she thought she loved her husband. It was largely like a business relationship where they occupied separate parts of the house and just worked together for the practical purposes of a relationship kids home money. She even told me he had cameras inside the house that he'd watch and monitor. As I started to become more attached to her I became more nervous and more fearful. It was at this time she made a reference to the effect of me being her favorite person and something along the lines of she'd let anyone go before letting me go meaning friends etc. The situation to me as it began was that this girl was wonderful and I'd have been a fool to let her life go by without joy and happiness. She truly was to me someone very special. One of the first things she texted me on instagram was that she perceived me to be less happy than I appeared at work. She just seemed so genuine to me but as time went on I feared that maybe I couldn't trust her. She revealed a lot about her childhood but not much about the emotions she felt. Like I know she had a tumultuous upbringing. She literally lived in a village with a bed that was above a wooden stove that heated it beneath. I know her dad whipped her and her brother. She was unfairly responsible for a lot as a kid. She also revealed she had a bout of bulimia in high school. She told me they were told more often that they did something wrong rather than be congratulated for good work. She didn't like me complimenting her too much. She would try to change the subject if I'd say much to that effect. She didn't like when I gave her positive reinforcement either. Like if I said I appreciated something she'd say I was trying to train her. One thing I'd said I appreciate was when she sent photos of home. Like what she was doing or what her son and her were doing. I just liked feeling as if I was included in her life. I spoiled the hell out of her. I brought her food and everything I could each time we worked together about once a week. What happened though eventually was we had a night together finally a month or so after our first kiss. I did not perform well. The anxiety of it all and the feeling that I was being told when and if things are going to happen. This wasn't like I'm feeling horny and you are right next to me. This was I'm coming over this day and we're going to get it on. I'm 33 and my sex drive isn't quite that great and add in this whole complicated situation and well it didn't go well. This was the first time she said I love you though when we were doing other things in bed together. I became nervous about my failure to perform. I didn't discuss with her the reason or anything regarding it so that was likely my mistake. The next time we saw each other and I said I love you she said can we not say I love you so much. That shook me because I didn't know what it meant like holidays? lol I told her to not tell me how to love her and she accepted that although it probably bred contempt. Fast forward a couple weeks and we are in the car after work and I saw her getting close to another coworker at work. This coworker later said he felt some vibes from her too but once he saw we'd become close he didn't think any more of it. When I saw them two close I asked her about it. She said you doubt my feelings for you? She got upset and rightfully so later that day she was very panicked and called to say that she was shook up by it. Now our birthdays are approaching. I'd thought we'd see each other on my birthday. No we didn't. Then her birthday was the day after mine. Didn't see each other that day either. Then another 5 days or so went by and she didn't come over or anything. Just prior to what happened next she sent me the music video for Wicked Game. Paranoia took over me and I just asked after a day where communication was kind of lacking between us if she was distancing herself. She told me that no she wasn't distancing herself and that a healthy relationship is two people living separately with separate interests and coming together in the middle to share. Then she said at the time that now she felt worse and that I felt better. Two days later and she called to break up with me and said love is not enough. That was the blackest my life has ever seemed. I had never experienced anything like it. Like I was just floating through a sea of nothingness. The very next day she texted to say she still thought of me and that she was worried. I just told her that I couldn't help her feel better about her decision to break up at that time. Almost a week went by and she called me. I didn't answer because I figured if it were important she would have called again. Curiosity got the better of me a couple days later and I called her back. She answered and we spoke she said that she had to become better at disappointing me. She told me it would take some time to get back to normal between us but it didn't take long. She revealed that she'd written in the birthday card she got me but never gave me that I made her want to have kids again. She later revealed that she feared and projected that I'd be jealous of the time devoted to our children over me. The fantasies continued and she envisioned us growing old together and that we'd rest when we were old. She is a very hard worker. I've never met anyone so goal oriented in my life. She was truly busy and between her husband not helping her her son school and work she was truly doing it all. I can tell that my persistent need for attention probably bothered her but as I became closer I could no longer act cool. After we got back together she suggested we go to the movies. I was so happy to finally do something with her outside of work or just spending a night together. Some time to finally bond and enjoy ourselves just sounded great to me. I had a great time and I thought she did too. She said before we went into the movie that she was sorry and that she'd never forgive herself for what she'd done when she broke up with me. She told me when she'd broken up she stowed away everything I'd given her and deleted our conversation on Instagram. She also revealed that it was a time where she considered going to therapy or doing a virtual session. This was I think one of two times she'd ever say she was sorry to me. I don't remember when it was that she'd said this but it was either before this breakup or somewhere else in the middle of all of this but she said I need to love you less. That's not a good thing to hear. This period was probably the best time of our relationship. She even entrusted me to watch her son while she went to an eye appointment. It was moments like these that I needed where I actually felt valuable to her. I didn't think much of myself outside of opportunities like this. A week or so after our night at the movies she came over again to my place. When she came over this time I performed better but still not well enough. I think I went like 5 minutes and then just lost it for whatever reason. I'm not a very experienced guy and I never really talked about it with her because I thought she'd think less of me. A few more weeks go by and she says that she can no longer spend time with me after work. We'd have like twenty minutes between us after a shift and of course I assumed incorrectly it was because of me. I needed reassurance probably a little too often. I don't know if it was the nature of the relationship the first breakup or what it was but I felt on edge. She assured me it wasn't because of me that she didn't want to or couldn't stay after work. She said her husband found a innocent picture that I'd given her of me. I knew that a lot of what I'd given her was stowed away so I wondered how only this picture was found. He then deduced that I was a person on her instagram from my photo. She warned me to not text her and that she'd contact me. This went on for a little while successfully until one morning I sent her a couple of messages on Instagram. He was actually online on her instagram and saw the messages where I'd said I love you. She didn't contact me the rest of the day so I knew something was wrong. That night I called her and she answered crying. She said that he'd told her she was a bad mother and all sorts of terrible things. He also messaged me the next day saying I hear you are very good friends with my wife I also want to be friends. I told her about this and she begged me not to reply and to block him. A few hours later he had blocked me. She told me he'd even planned to send me pregnancy photos of her. It was truly messed up. This whole situation is I know. When he blocked me I wondered why. She told me he was viewing the messages over and over. She told me he was planning to tell his parents and that it would be soon discussed within the family. I never heard much about it after that. My paranoia increased. A few weeks went by and we had some intimate encounters but she still wasn't coming over to spend the night at all. I felt maybe that was due to my inability to really perform but I wasn't sure. After her husband found out though understandably there wasn't as much communication between her and I. Now I waited for her to initiate everything. I waited for phone calls. I waited for texts. One day she texted me precisely before I began work and I said it meant a lot that she did that because it was something she used to do. She told me I was trying to train her. We never had real quality time together. Work was really the best thing we had between the two of us. This is where it all began to break. One day I exchanged just a couple texts with her even though it was against the rules and I never received a call. I had a spell of emotions come over me and I got upset I said some rough things nothing too crazy. The next day we spoke and I said asked her if she was happy. She said if she still calls and I still answer that we're happy. She then began dissecting what I was really asking and she came to the conclusion that I was actually saying that I wasn't happy. I felt our communication was so difficult and we hadn't spent any real quality time together by this time since the movies and our one night together. She told me she doesn't do reassurance. She said she'd have to take time to herself and she'd miss me and stuff but she'd not really be speaking to me. The next week or more I just got texts saying things like I miss you can't talk good morning. This went on and on for like I said over a week. I was getting really affected by it. There I was the other man in this whole thing and I'm wondering how important am I? After all she has a husband and a life outside of our relationship. She was absolutely my primary partner. I finally got upset and sent her a text that was lengthy and said don't contact me I don't know what is going on I don't have clarity on anything etc. She must have had my phone number blocked because the next morning I received another good morning message. So I sent another similar message again. This one was delivered because she didn't say anything at all. I'll admit I wanted her to fight for our relationship. I wanted her to see how difficult this was for me. I understand that I was wreaking havoc on her life to some extent. I was definitely a hindrance to any stability in her life. Well after nothing came to me within a couple of days I freaked out. I went back on everything I'd said and apologized profusely and went on and on with a whole bunch of texts and calls. Like a whole bunch. I was so fearful and felt like I was digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that I'd been responsible for. I still felt I was owed some clarity on her stance with her husband and what was happening behind the scenes but I knew that I was screwing up. After all of this she said it was toxic and that I was frightening her. After she said that I lost it. I was supposed to work with her that night and I called off because I couldn't fathom being near her when she'd said I frightened her. Well that night she was super pissed. She said that I was acting like an 18 year old boy not a 33 year old man. She said there was no more us at work no more spending time together no more talking no more anything. I was shook up by this as I'd been by everything before it. I told her honestly that when I'd called off that my manager knew it was because of some disagreement between her and I. I had known my manager for years and she was a friend so I didn't think much of it. After she said all of this there is no more us stuff several more days went by and I decided to resign from the job. She talked to me finally a couple days after the day I resigned. When we spoke she said that her dad never understood her mom and she was fearful because I didn't understand her. At the end of the call I revealed to her that I quit the job. She abruptly hung up on me and later told me that she began to cry after I told her I'd done it because of what she said. She later texted me and said she wanted me to let her go. This where things got really messy. She told me she wanted to be single. I told her I need time to move on. She replied I will not remind you of myself. I told her she could write a letter if she ever had some clarity on all of this. She replied I will not send a letter I don't like writing letters. A few days again went by and I tried reaching out to her. She asked me what I'd done in those few days apart. I told her that I'd done nothing meaning I hadn't been with anyone else. When we began talking again things got rough she began trying to lose weight. She asked if it was because I was nervous why I hadn't performed well in bed. I told her that it was but she questioned whether it was her body. She talked about getting breast implants. She told me that the beginning was fantasy and that it'd never be like that again. She once texted me and said that she missed me more than I even knew but that she can't be vulnerable. She said that she needed to learn to love not me. She said so many things during this period that makes me question everything today. I know women can be emotional and I was definitely emotional enough for the both of us but this was next level. After a struggle to see her she finally said she wanted to see me. When I did I felt just as we always had together. The butterflies and like she was just the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on. She allowed me to touch her intimately when we had this meeting but it was almost the last time she'd allow me to do so. What happened in the weeks following was my job was reinstated because my resignation was never given to anyone above my manager. She didn't forward it so that she could protect my employment in case I changed my mind. When we worked together those next few weeks there was some contentiousness between us. One night she was upset because something regarding her parents' immigration wasn't going well. She did not tell me what it was initially. I always wanted to know what was bothering her and I was sensitive to her moods. My life with her felt so microscopic. Each interaction was magnified. Each gesture became what I'd live with for the next week as we spent time apart. I was often visibly disappointed when she would not share what was going on. She was very good at reading my expressions. She stormed off and when I caught up with her she had her pants hiked up really high near this one male nurse we worked with. I thought something of this because she'd said she did that near me initially when we began our little courtship. Later that night I said I wanted her to be happy. That I wanted to have a good time. She asked what I meant by a good time. I said that I wanted to have fun. That we never had any opportunities to just have fun together. It was soon after that I decided to go back to school to better myself and to impress my gf I guess. When I did so she took one of the classes with me. So we'd have Monday nights together in class. Our job soon closed because the building it was in was no longer going to be serviced. This left us only with our class together. She would never come over ever again to my place after our argument involving work. I did my best each week to spoil her. I made salmon salad that I kept on ice in the car and we'd eat it after class released. I got her a spa package to enjoy so that she could just a take a minute to relax. I really missed her. I really really really missed her. I needed time with her to really bond. Her life was undoubtedly busy but the lack of quality time we had together came off as disinterest to me. I became so attached but so worried about the previous damaged I'd done that I began to spiral. In the class we had a good time initially. There was even one week where he had cancelled class and we had like an hour and a half together. It was great. I felt just happy to finally have uninterrupted time with her. She asked me during that time jokingly if I had brought the salmon salad again for her. Also I'd gotten her a whole box of candies that she liked since childhood called Bounty. She asked where they were and why I'd not given them to her. She told me she liked seeing my reaction when I was asked things like this. When I told her I hadn't eaten them because I'd had enough sweets. She asked who have you been getting sweets with. I just said a friend of mine Will. I felt so awkward because she had not been paying much attention to me prior to this night we had together. Texts were more sporadic and often mine that I sent weren't replied to. We still spoke every day pretty much but there was never much to talk about. I craved shared experiences and a sense of security. I'd done my part to ruin things but it felt like this was all being sabotaged. One day I called her after I got out of a therapy session and asked her how do I ask for what I need? I was being starved. I felt overwhelmed by how much I felt I was being ignored. However I do know during this time she wasn't caring for herself much either. She was irritated when I asked this of her. One night near the very end I offered her a BetterHelp therapy membership. I told her it was the best thing that I could give her. I had already tried brightening her spirits with the spa gift and the other little things I'd tried to do. She said she didn't want to go and that only she could decide when it was necessary to go. She told me she didn't like how I was trying to change her. Another week near the end I sat next to her in class like always. After class she asked me why my legs were so far from her legs beneath the table. I certainly felt the pushpull behavior. I know she had a lot on her plate but I was single I didn't have all of these responsibilities and dramas. I was focused on her. A little too much maybe. I didn't know if she'd done this before?? Why the cameras in the house?? Why the invitation of a threesome?? I didn't know if I was really important. My mind raced and raced. One of the final days we had I asked her in a text if I ask to spend more time with her isn't that something she'd want to do because she loves me. The next day we spoke on the phone and I asked her to reply to that when she could she said that I can't ask someone to do that. She'd reply whenif she was ready to do so. I was struggling so much I have thought at times I might die of a broken heart over this. What finally happened was her son was sick she told me the day before we had class together that she needed a break and requested that I don't text her. I agreed and the next day we saw each other in class. I broke. I asked her if she'd have any time for us after class she just shook her head no. I snapped. I began just staring at her intermittently for a good ten minutes or so. Sulking in the chair next to her I was probably a real sorry sight to see. She looked to me and said we'll talk after class. I made some passive aggressive remarks about borrowing a pen and stuff but nothing too bad. When we got out of class I was immediately upset. She patronizingly said let's have a discussion. As if I hadn't been trying to have one all along about my needs. I said did you talk to your husband today? She said I have to he has my son. I replied well nothing for me then huh? The let's have a discussion remark made me begin to crack a smile she did not like that because I just thought to myself how ridiculous is all of this. I love her I still do. How on earth could she not see how ridiculous it had all become and how it practically was from the start. The argument went mostly like that for just another minute or so before she began walking away. I followed and she said I don't like the way you love. Your love is overwhelming. She got in the car and as I tried to offer her a water I had brought for her she said I don't want anything from you anymore. She had headaches a lot and one night she drank and ate the ice from the salmon salad on her way home that's why I had brought the water for her. She went home and I went to meet up with my one friend. I called her and left a voicemail that said something like I wish you the best in all the things you have going on. I hope you learn to love and accept love. The next day I hadn't yet heard from her and I texted her. When I did she told me that maybe a business relationship is what she needs. She can't handle arguments in love. She told me she went home had a few drinks and considered her husband's proposal to get back together. By that she meant they had sex. She told me that what we had wasn't special that it was in my head. One thing she asked was why I smiled. I said I couldn't believe I was being treated like this. She replied you're saying I'm a bad partner. I said I've been asking you for weeks to see you. I just couldn't believe the whole thing. She acts concerned about such a thing after admitting to having sex with her husband. Her mind truly was chaotic. Where was she when I was breaking at the seams over our lack of time together. We have not communicated at all since that night. The last thing I sent was one heart emoji. I had no words from her to say anything about what I meant. Nothing. I have cried so much over the last few months. I think often about the day that I die and if I might be able to call her and see her one last time so that we might be able to imagine what it might have been if we'd had a chance. A real chance. I don't know. I blame myself. I know that I might have a problem. Maybe we both have a problem. I don't know anything anymore. It was real to me. Maybe I was just being used? If I could go back I would have stopped it from progressing as far as it did. I felt my confidence and my security change once it advanced. I don't know what does this mean to you guys on here? I've read a lot of BPD NARC stuff. Youtube Reddit you name it. Do I have a problem? Is how I acted aside from beginning this affair in the first place that outlandish? Why didn't she understand how I might feel being in my position? Was this just a natural breakdown of an affair? Did I really mean nothing? How do I move on from this? How was this a genuine relationship with none of the healthy aspects a relationship has. Is it because she has a different outlook on love culturally? Is it because she sabotages relationships. I can't see how any intimate relationship with her could succeed there doesn't seem to be any consistency. I am so confused. Thank you to anyone who reads and dissects this whole thing. Thanks for any hesitance to pass judgement onto me.,Personality-disorder
51397,The urge to disappear and start over. First I want to say that I am not diagnosed. I've seen quite a lot of posts about this urge to disappear on rSchizoidhttpswww.reddit.comrSchizoid and also rAvPDhttpswww.reddit.comrAvPD.I am kind of glad that I am not the only one who does this. I constantly delete my social media and start over. By doing this I also ghost all of my friends on Discord. With social media like Reddit Twitch and others creating new accounts isn't a problem for me because I don't post anything. I only keep my Steam account. I always knew it's not normal. I didn't know other people also struggle with this.My friends are annoyed whenever I come up with a new Discord account. I really don't want to talk to them about this. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings with people I know. I feel like they wouldn't understand me andor would judge me. Most of my friends I've known since 2017. I usually just come up with a dumb excuse like I forgot my password or something like that.I want to explain the weird urge I get whenever I feel like disappearing. Under a post there was this commentgtThere was a point where I realized I was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point I would get that urge to restart. Not just with accounts but with everything. I'd plan out how I was going to use an account build a new habit accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible and for a while follow through. Eventually I would drift off track a little let it eat at me and then give up and decide I'll start over and do it better. At this point I struggle to get to the I'm going to try stage and usually just don't bother. The apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more.This comment describes my situation very accurately. I feel almost exactly as this guy.Creating new accounts has become a routine. I feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything. It's kind of hard to explain how I feel..I ghosted my friends like 3 weeks ago. Throughout the weeks I've tried to start over but I always fail and just start over once again.. I didn't tell anyone I'll disappear. I deleted my Discord and now I'm gone. My friend texted me on Snapchat asking why I deleted my account. I just responded with something like yeah lol. Didn't even give an answer. Ever since then I haven't talked to them. I want to but I know I'm gonna disappear after a month. I also don't want to explain to them why I deleted my account because I can't even do it right now where I am anonymous.Probably a lot of mistakes very unorganized post but yeah.. I hate this. I just want to be normal. ,Personality-disorder
51398,Is it better to never experience love and thus never get hurt or it's worth trying even if the hurt will have longlasting consequences or will lead to something more drastic like suicide? As the title says I'm so sensitive to rejection that the smallest amount of desinterest banter or subtle mockery can send me into a suicidal episode with the never going to be good enough mantra at its core. I'm presented with the chance of entering a relationship but I'm literally scared shitless ugh just wanna pull away.,Personality-disorder
51399,If something bad ever happens to me there is a chance most of the people who personally know me in life would never find out I live across the country far away from any family. For the most part Im very lonely and have been lonely for the majority of my life due to all sorts is issues and trauma since I was a kid. I have a few friends that I occasionally meet but I dont regularly talk to outside of that. I rarely talk to my family as I dont have a close relationship with them. I went to college and met people there but I havent kept in touch with anyone from college after graduating.Most of the people who know me in life have no clue what Im doing or even how my life is right now. They havent heard from me in ages. If I ever went missing they would probably never find out. If I ever died the people who have known me in life would probably never find out. The only people who would know anything are my coworkers doctors and family. They would only find out if my work requested a check on me after not showing up for work for a while. Family would most like be notified through that. Doctors would only find out I was gone once I stop answering calls and showing up for appointments.This is just scary to think about. Ive lived alone my whole and there is a good chance I would die alone. Life just sucks man. Why couldnt I just have had a normal life?,Personality-disorder
51400,Reaching out for connection Hey guys ! I'm a 24F and I'm very lonely these days. Ive been going back and forth on wether I should post this but here goes ! I recently lost someone who I thought was a friend he wasn't. Anyways we used to call each other and watch movies thru the phone or TV shows. Sometimes also smoke weed while we watched. My question is do any of you have a desire to do this with me ? I work long hours outside and then my bf does band practice so I'm alone a lot during the weekends or evenings. Obviously I know this post begging for human connection is sad but feel free to reach out my DMS are open ,Personality-disorder
51401,is it just me or is most of the material you find online about this disorder defeatist af? Like most of the videos I find about avpd just states what it is and then ends with yeah this isn't curable. Then you venture into the comments and see people complaining about their partner with this disorder .,Personality-disorder
51402,Am I just an A..hole? My main way I avoid people is by playing devils advocate being cold extreme opinions saying rude things or sticking to superficial topics. I often compusively make myself the villian with friends. Not because I want to but because having them hate me is secretly doing them a favor. from all the post I've read alot of AVPD people sound like push overs or like eeyore from winnie the pooh. I'm starting wonder how many people play out their AVPD like me or if I'm got some other underlying disorder like odd or I'm just an ahole? Can someone confirm this?,Personality-disorder
51404,Progression and regression Hey guys gals and enby pals. Its been a hot minute since Ive posted here. That was on my old account though. My name is Ciara. Im a 25 year old trans girl and I have avpd.obviously lol Since I use to post Ive made some decent progress. I managed to get a job in I shit you not retail. I actually managed to hold it down for a couple months even lol. Heck in a few instances I even was kind of good at it. But eventually I cracked and quit. I could only get ignored or misgendered so many times. Now Im back at square one. I know I can push myself but my endurance seems so fickle. Although I do have some confidence. I know Im not inferior. Took me a long time get there but I know Im gonna have to put myself back out into the world soon. I cant be a neet again. Idk where Im going with this I just kind of felt like venting a bit.,Personality-disorder
51405,Im just so dumb socially because Ive been isolating for so long Im 19 and havent had a friend in 4 years. Isolated myself from the world for eight months. So I fell so so hard for this guy just cuz he flirted with me. And now it seems so obvious he was just messing with me cuz he didnt answer like half of my texts till days later and never actually asked me anything about myself. But I made excuses because I thought I was being like clingy and not understanding how relationships work. But no if a guy likes you hes gonna show interest and actually answer your textsIts a little weird because Im paranoid so I assume everything means everyone hates me. But now that Im aware of this Im trying to stop it. But I went too far in the opposite direction now and ignored my good judgement because Im so inexperienced socially.,Personality-disorder
51406,Cat is missing and I have no one I can talk to. Our cat who I love dearly has been missing for 3 nights now and shes never stayed outside for more than a few hours in the entire last 2 years that weve lived here so Im really worried. It sucks having no friends sometimes. I wish I had a single good friend I could talk to.,Personality-disorder
51407,AvPD or just selfish? Im trying to understand if its because my partner is selfish or its because of AvPD. Will take and take and take and ask for more and state I dont do anything. Will never do nice gestures for me such as offer to pick me up drop me off take me to lunch. Be affectionate. Anything really. Treat me like a doormat. Cancel plans on me last minute prioritize commitments with random people disregard my feelingsthoughts. Were moving in and our place is going to be used as a business place with clients sitting in the living room all day and evening. Never take any responsibility always contort discussions criticisms and play victim. I understand a lot of AvPD behaviors are rooted in shame and self doubt but I dont see how that applies to the above behaviors.I would describe her as a high functioning AvPD. Ive read some posts from similar people and by her own words she feels like she is wearing a mask around other people all the time. Also seems shes used to using and disregarding partnersmen. Her life long friend called her out on this.EDITI needed some clarity and validation! I do not think this is AvPD which is why I had to ask. Also was looking for experiences from those in similar situations with mine or those with AvPD.Thank you for the replies especially the detailed one from uCulturalAbrocoma83,Personality-disorder
51408,Do AVPD attract Needy people? So my brand is of AVPD is very not giving a F about others. I care about people but in a relationship context I do not care. I sometime tell new people that ask for instagram or contact I don't need anymore friends. I've learned to put a super cold front to avoid people. However there is a subset of people that go harder the more I push or ghost them away. I typically find that they are approvalpeople seeking and want to be liked by everyone. So often times a friendship with me is hard one with them doing 70percent of the effort. Do you guys find this as a pattern?,Personality-disorder

51410,Feeling jealousy and not good enough when close friends start talking to someone else and direct most of their attention to them To be clear I'm not talking about drifting away from each other over time but rather like getting ditched where it all happens in a few minutes or less. This has happened to me a few times but the worst time was a few days ago because it happened with the closest friend I've ever had. It actually happened with them a few months ago too. I also feel bad for feeling like this and trying hard to not push them away but just can't control these feelings. A few days ago we were playing an online game together as we often do and after a while they mentioned that they were also talking to another friend while playing and I realized that was why they were so quiet compared to all the other times. I started shutting down after that but kept playing together for a few hours. We didn't say anything but I knew they were talking to the other friend instead. They did say bye when they were getting off and for the first time I didn't say anything back. Still haven't said anything and feel bad cause we are the best friends each other has ever had and I know for sure it is true for them they are not lying. But just can't help these feelings of not wanting to talk to them anymore and pushing them away. I feel so ridiculous for feeling like this like for them it's just a normal interaction with someone else and not knowing how bad it made me feel.,Personality-disorder
51411,Friend Wants to take me to Strip Club I'm a 32 yo male. Never really had much experience with women and all attempts have ended in catastrophe. I mean I've officially thrown in the towel. My friend is insistent on taking me to a strip club and I'm worried. I feel a lot of dread and anxiety about it. He keeps saying things like you're not feeling anxiety that's anticipation. I'm going to end up going because I don't want to disappoint especially because he's paying but I'm curious.

51413,Just had a date and it was neutral I've seen two posts of two extremes in the past 24 hours here and rsocialanxiety one that went wellhttpsredd.it10tpr60 ended with a kiss and one that apparently was awfulhttpsredd.it10tws9h but still a growing experience so I figured I'd report my experience that was somewhere in the middle.Recently had a girl message me on Tinder and the conversation went really wellflowed really naturally. She suggested we meet up and considering how much I've progressed recently I figured I wouldn't give myself enough time to reconsiderdoubt myself and just said yes.I was pretty chill for the most part but my nerves got the best of me once there were only two hours left before the date but it still wasn't nearly as bad as it would've been before.The date went pretty well. I was pretty nervous but nothing that was overwhelming. We walked and talked a bunch went to a small art exhibition grabbed some ice cream and then I had to leave.Overall a very pleasant experience despite the nervousness. I would have neeever in my life had thought that I'd be able to go on a tinder date fully sober. In the past I had to get blackout drunk other drugs to even text people on Tinder so I'm very very very glad I had the power in me to not cancel or chicken out and actually go through with this even if nothing might come of it. I'll definitely have more confidence moving forward thanks to this experience.Good luck out there!,Personality-disorder
51414,I only see two options in my future Abandon my entire life leaving everyone and everything behind. Or just kill myself. Or both.I let the closest friendships Ive ever had die because I cant be a normal person. I never contact people first because I feel like Im rudely intruding whenever I present myself to someone in any fashion. I dont even call my own family members and tell them I love them because it feels like anything I do is placing a burden on others.I dont have a plan I just wanna drive until I run out of money. I just wanna experience what life is like without having the people you know perceive your actions even if its just for a short time before I eventually succumb to my suicidal ideation.,Personality-disorder
51415,Is it possible to have both Avoidantdismissive attachment style and Avpd? Do any of you have both? I read that when you have avoudantdismissive attachment style you have often good selfconfidence and that's why you can't have Avpd. Is that true? I think they are two different things and while you may feel like you can do things best yourself it doesn't mean you can't feel shame an inferior to others.,Personality-disorder
51416,Therapy or Attachment Therapy? 50something gay man here. While Ive been in therapy for most of my life because I was always dealing with dysthymia Persistent Depression Attachment issues were never discovered or diagnosed. A year ago TMS put my depression into remission which has been amazing. Awesome. Endless superlatives. However....With PDD no longer fouling the view surprisesurprise I see now that DismissiveAvoidant Attachment has been playing merrily in my psyche my attention having been elsewhere.I've never had a real deep intimate sexual relationship. Sex yes. Friends yes but again none particularly deep. Distancing. Closed off. Difficulty trusting. From what I can tell DA has influenced inhibited even impaired a lot of areas of my life. Id like to fix or improve those if I can. To be honest Im a bit concerned read scared that I wont be able to do that. DA is a hard one to move to Secure Attachment. From reading it looks like it basically takes an intimate SA partner and therapy to change an attachment style. Since I haven't even had a crappy intimate relationship that seemsunlikely. lolI have therapist right now. Weve talked a bit about this. Hes not an expert certified in Attachment Therapy. Cognitive Behavioral? Yes. General support especially with the TMS stuff yes. Given the seeming intractability of DA I'm wondering if he's right for tackling this? I know DA is an error in cognition but its also wrapped up in feelings and in behaviors that Im not even aware of. Trauma. Family of origin stuff. There's a lot that goes into DA. And while I've tackled much of this in regular therapy I've never come at it from an attachment angle with someone who specialized in Attachment Theory and stylesSo in your opinion is it better to have a therapist that specializes in Attachment Issues or is that not necessary? Will an Attachment group or class suffice? Is changing therapists reasonable here I'm up for doing that or is that idea someone just another sign of Avoidant Dismissing behavior? While I aint dead and have no plans on dying anytime soon or later for that matter I would like to fix this DA before I shuffle off. Along those lines Id like to stumble and fail at a real relationship or two I know DA is hard to lessen on the off chance that I just succeed at one. I want to improve my life. Im just trying to figure out the best way to go at it. Any advice here would be great.,Personality-disorder
51417,Always unfulfilled by sex? Hey everyone! So I'm a trans woman who is completely and utterly confused by sex. I've somehow managed to have sex with multiple different people yet every time I feel wayyyyyyyy too anxious to actually enjoy any of the pleasure and instead delegate myself to please my partner instead. When I think about sex it seems appealing but whenever I actually get to have it I can't help but panic and be scared that I'm not good enough for them... Is this normal? Can anyone else relate? I don't think I am asexual since I'm very much so attracted to men and women and everything in between but any advice would be nice.,Personality-disorder
51418,Just got home from a party All I did was stand awkwardly by myself in the middle of the room the whole time. Despite drinking and smoking some weed I felt too aware of myself and any potential eyes on me. Im always so utterly restricted I never let myself have any fun never dance never play any drinking games participate in karaoke etc. because I dont want to people to judge how badly I am doing Im scared they would want nothing to do with me if they see how bad at I am at everything.

51419,So i just went on a date... I'm M28 up to this point i have had next to zero experience with dating or women in general. I started chatting again with this girl that i had ghosted after asking her out on another app almost exactly a year ago. I was surprised that she would match with me again this time i decided to go trough with it though. What helped i think is that she is of a pretty similar personality type as me not a big time texter and sometimes slow to respond etc..I decided to be just totally honest when we met i told her I'm not the most exciting guy and that I'm pretty boring honestly but i said it with kind of a smile and a good attitude. We ended up holding hands walking trough the city and i kissed her on the way to my car and again when i dropped her off. It felt like there might be some hope after all. She asked me what we should do next time and i had no answer because i hadn't even considered it could ever come to that. ampx200BI just had to tell someone. I'm not trying to brag. If anything its an example that even if your feel inadequate and unworthy like i do often its mostly on the inside. I've told myself noone will ever like me this is simply untrue and if you feel this way its most likely untrue for you too.,Personality-disorder

51422,I'm trying to solve an internal issue externally And I know this wont work but idk what else to do. I just genuinely hate myself and I hope that maybe if I hit my goal weight I can finally have the confidence to talk to people and not feel so awful. Every social interaction feels like I'm being analyzed under a petri dish. Logically I know this isn't true but it feels true. This causes me to put on an act which causes me to not be present with people which causes the awkwardness that I fear. I'm focused on my facial expressions if I'm saying the right words with the right tone of voice. My mind goes blank half the time. I know that people typically enjoy it when you ask about them and their interests. Yet for some reason I just struggle to talk. I start stuttering slurring my words or going so overboard on sounding perfect that I sound like a robot reading off a script. .I just want to relax and enjoy myself. Sometimes I'm able to. Most times I'm not. I'm always waiting to feel embarrassed and then I go back to isolating myself. The motivation for change is there but I'm soooo scared and exhausted.,Personality-disorder

I was so excited and hopeful about making friends but then I realized how since I got divorced I look so much older and so much chubbier.... I felt I would be able to sense by their reaction to me that I am not good enough and I don't belong. So I canceled. I feel sad about it. Also I never have money and I had a little extra cash so this is one of the few times I was going to be able to afford this group.

And it's annoying because when I am around people and do that it apparently gives them feeling like I am tired of them or even irritated while in fact I am just tired every single second of my life.It's not exactly avpd trait I think it's more about being mentally ill in general.

51429,my friend bpd really exhausts me. i dont think i even wanna be their friend anymore im sick of always being wrong no matter what i do and am expected to know what i did wrong. im tired of constant arguments and always feeling like a shitty human being in the end when i dont even know what i did. im just sick of being misunderstood and never given a chance to explain and my friend knows im avoidant but doesnt seem to fucking care how i feel anymorethings were great at first. happy fun friendship lalala and then they became really clingy and wanted to be my favorite. i felt happy at first at the idea because wowww someone really likes me that much?!?!!!!then they would always wanna be better than my friends call and shower me with compliments. it was sweet and flattering at first.. then we got into some confusing relationship thing. they never clearly defined what it even was. i was too afraid to back out. it got overwhelming. and eventually i found myself distancing away. i was really confused about it all. they explained things terribly. i never knew what exactly they wanted it was never clear. what i did wrong what we were their intentions anything. they seemed to expect me to know it all but fucking hell i really dont i cant read into things so easily. maybe im flat out stupidi told them about avpd and such and they understood and were really nice and understanding at first. then more arguments accusations guilt tripping. i get it i was also a shithead in this situation i thinkthe guilt tripping manipulation expectations them acting like a victim im really drained. ive apologized over and over and cried often and its fucked me upi know im not perfect but i try my best to be kind and always have good intentions and i tell them that and oh my god they dont get it at all theyre a genuinely nice person and i know that. im just so tired of the anger i cant take itno offense to those who have bpd. this person in particular has no self awareness or anything. and i guess they totally just blew off my avpd and just shit on me and it really hurts,Personality-disorder
51430,Autism and AvPD crossover? Hi so I'm diagnosed with autism and years ago about 14 I was diagnosed with social anxiety as well. I recently found out about AvPD and I feel like I relate to the majority of symptoms I've found.I checked on the autism subreddit about this but i found someone arguing that you can't diagnose people with autism and AvPD because it's so hard to tell. Which confused me.I'm currently 17 turning 18 in September. I attend a sixth form college but that is literally the only place I go. I have no remaining friends even though I really want close friends and people have tried to make friends with me. I really avoid making friends though bc I feel so awkward and uncomfortable and trying to interact with people makes me so tired that I can't cope with it. But its a constant struggle between feeling so lonely and really not wanting to talk to anyone. I can't tell if this is specifically just autism or maybe AvPD because I find a lot of autistic people don't actually avoid making friends rather just struggle to. I can't go anywhere by myself I've never been to a shop alone before because of who I could have to speak to or if anything went wrong. I feel sick at the idea of actually approaching people or speaking in a group. I can rarely text I can't make phone calls and I don't like going out so I lose friends pretty quick because I essentially ghost them even when I don't mean to. This is one of the main reasons I don't want to make new friends because I know I'm not a great friend. In the future I plan on doing a job either part time or from home because I can't cope with interacting with people. At school in my free periods I can't even stand sitting in the same room as others especially if they're talking. And I can't eat in front of others. I feel like I'm on show. These don't apply to my parents or my older sister. If I'm with them these are easier.Originally I thought it was just being autistic or social anxiety or agoraphobia maybe. But then I found out about AvPD. It definitely could just be autism. But I feel so isolated and lonely but I dont want to be around anybody and I can't bare the thought of this being my entire life without any chance of it getting better. Could anyone maybe just tell me if you have any similar experiences or advice? I'm just not sure what to do.,Personality-disorder

51432,I Just Talked With My Boss... Yeah... let me tell you I might have nightmares about it.My job lets me book working hours at any point of night or day. So I naturally started booking weekends...Nobody comes on the weekends so I stopped preparing as much. This weekend I went to my job without washing my hear and with home clothes. I thought nobody is going to be there... why did I do that ahhhhhNot a long while after I arrived some of my collegues messages me that he wants me to work for 1530 minutes more that day because he left his laptop at a restaurant and he wants to get it back... and he's coming to the office in 30 minutes Welp they got usBut my collegue is not by boss right? Why does the title mention my boss then?After my collegue arrived my boss dropped in xd. He had a conversation with me about me working a little less past month 91h the limit at my company is 84. He asked me if I'm doing ok and all I was able to think in my head is he's checking if I'm not liability and it's one of the last straws soon I'm going to get fired. I acutally always feared being fired. The fact that I dropped out of uni and don't have a degree AND this job pays a lot and everyone here is very noncontrolling makes it much worse.I hate it when my mind just hyperfocuses on someone's face and picks up their micro expressions then concludes they have no respect for me.Of course all of this is projection... but relly it would be terrible if I lost this job. I have no qualification and I only got here because I was recommended they have a policy that they always hire.,Personality-disorder
51433,New here. A work related conundrum. I'm a male in my late 30s struggling to find traction in terms of being able to support myself. Recently I've only lasted a few weeks in a couple of different environments retail and warehouse. I could do the actual jobs well enough but I get tripped up socially targeted by others and quit as a consequence. I've had a difficult time throughout my adult years sustaining employment. There have been times where I had long term prospects but they ultimately ended badly. This has me in a pretty desperate mindset and I've decided to seek services for help finding something suitable.What I want ideally is to have a space to work as independently as possible with low social expectations and predictable responsibilities. I've been doing some gig work off and on which meets those requirements but that isn't a reliable income and you burn through gas. My wife who makes OK income is being as patient and supportive as possible with me but we need a second income especially with living costs skyrocketing. It's crucial that I maintain a job so that I can keep the marriage stable and avoid homelessness which is what would likely happen if things fall apart. We don't have kids so at least that isn't an issue at stake.I should add that I'd never qualify for disability benefits given my education and work history. What have others done to be able to support themselves long term? What accommodations if any have you asked for in a job? And finally has anyone significantly improved their selfimage and ability to handle the BS at work?Thanks for reading.,Personality-disorder

51440,I'm a burden 20F I moved back home to help my mom lessen the load that's on her with houseworks physical illness and a stressful season at work. I wanted to get a job to aid the financial situation and to do as much housework as possible so that she'd be relieved.Instead I'm avoiding all the job opportunities high on anxiety if I manage to land an interview rejecting the final offer in doubts of my ability to fulfill the employers expectations. I can't imagine myself doing any of the jobs properly so basically I don't even try them.And not only that I've drifted into depression again and have regular involuntary outbursts of crying even in front of her. Which of course puts even more pressure on her.I'm a burden I live off of my parents not contributing due to my goddamn diminished self worth and avoidant patterns. I have a therapist but the sessions are just once a week and of course it takes time to establish what we're working on and to start changing the patterns. It's been a month now though and so far so avoidant and depressed. I'm starting to get impatient because I don't want to be a burden any longer. Kinda wishing I never existed because if I unalive myself now it's going to be just as much of a burden as if I stay alive avoidant.,Personality-disorder
51441,How would I go about telling a person with AvPD how much I admire them? From what I understand of this disorder it would be difficultnear impossible to actually make them believe it.

51444,Anyone else here forever alone? Usually Im fine Ive known Ill be alone for years but sometimes the reality of it all comes crashing in. I have so much love to give but il never get to experience it being wanted by another person being loved or being able to love. The thing that 99 of the population will experience i am denied access to because I happened to receive some shit luck from the universe. How am I meant to accept that? Ive watched my friends who were just like me grow into capable adults experiencing relationships and new friendships while I havent moved at all. Im still the same stupid fucking kid I was at 16 terrified of the world and all the people in it. I am certain my brain wasnt built for life not in this world.This disorder is fucking brutal its completely ruined my life all I wanted was to be normal. But now Im doomed to this loneliness for life. And I cant ignore it every piece of media every time I leave the house theres love and couples everywhere. And Im not mad at them good for them Im just struggling to accept the fact that everybody else gets to experience it and i happen to be one of the unlucky few that doesnt all thanks to avpd. It hurts too fucking much the loneliness eats away at you all I asked was to feel wanted or validated by even 1 human being but apparently even that is too much. Its not even about the sex at all I just want to feel someone elses warmth have somebody fall asleep on my chest feeling safe and secure in my presence trusting me enough to open up to eachother. Avpd is so horrible this loneliness will 100 drive me to suicide Im not far off as it is. No human was meant to live like this I wouldnt even call it living. Sure you can survive with avpd but I dont think anyone can really say theyre really living if I knew I was gonna have to live with this shit Id have killed myself in the fucking womb I wish my mum did she deserves better. Sry for the stupid drunk rant just had to vent it somewhere. I hate myself so fucking much I never should have existed avpd is just too cruel how can this be my life how am I mean to be ok with that how am I meant to participate in society like every one else? I wish I was dead I should be dead theres just no point struggling with the rest of my life if its going to be alone. It already hurts this bad I will not let myself become an old even lonelier man looking back on a wasted life wishing Id have just ended it earlier,Personality-disorder
51445,I want to be there for others But I feel so blocked off. It's funny how I complain about people who are unavailable to me as I am unavailable to everyone else. Especially my younger sibling. I feel an overwhelming amount of guilt for how I treat him. I feel like I'm repeating the cycle that I went through. I completely avoid my younger brother and I've ruined our bond. He doesn't even look at me and it's my fault because I wouldn't even look at him. I'm sure that hurt him.It may not seem like it but I do try and care about him. When he does look at me I try to make sure I smile. I know how important that is for children. When he asks for a hug I'll give it even if I don't want to. When he wants to show me something I try to ask questions and give him praise for his creative works. I don't do this often enough though. I avoid him because I don't have much to give. Kids in general make me feel uneasy because they need so much from their caretakers I feel inadequate that I can't give them that. He reminds me of myself when I was younger and it makes me uncomfortable because I rejected that part myself a long time ago..Kids are authentically themselves until society molds them. I can already see it happening with him. He's quieter than he used to be. He doesn't look people in the eyes. He shuffles nervously. He stutters. He hides. All things I used to do when I began rejecting myself. I still do these things. My authentic self is locked away she's still there but shes completely hidden.It's like I want to save my brother before he goes down the same route as me but I can't even save myself. I just hope he can forgive me ,Personality-disorder

One of my teachers once called me the quietest girl theyd ever known and I would always get called a mute or asked if I ever talked. And I cant explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it I have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off. I dont even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse. I would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me theres something wrong with me over and over and its all I can think about. I hate it. I know Im not normal I know Im quiet I know I dont talk much so why does it hurt so much when someone tells me that?,Personality-disorder

51450,constantly drawing a blankbrain fog i honestly feel like i've had a brain injury of some sort. in like 80 of conversations even with family members i simply have no idea what to say in a conversation. my mind is a complete blank even in what would be a pretty standard 'easy' conversation. it's like i'm paralysed or something. i either mumble something only to retract it or just say nothing at all. it's awful and it makes me not want to talk to people even more because i don't want to put them in an awkward uncomfortable situation and make them think even worse of me. i'm really pessimistic about ever making friendships or even mere acquaintances nowadays. i literally have nothing to say i feel so socially inept that i just don't bother anymore.it didn't used to be this way either. i was confident talkative i had friends who i'd talk with long into the night. even with people who weren't my friends i could still hold a pretty decent conversation. where did that go? it feels like that part of me just left one day i don't know why or even when it did. it just left.i'm usually pretty fine about this. i don't crave intimacy or friendship and am pretty content by myself. but sometimes it just hits me how screwed i am. a family member had surgery recently and i texted them to see how they were doing. that resulted in them trying to have a conversation what with them being on bedrest and all but my responses were so... bad. they seemed to think so too because they stopped replying haha. i can't blame them in the least for it too. i wish it wasn't this way but i don't think there's much i can do about it either. this blankness it feels like it'll be there forever. like some kind of inpenetrable fog muffling my thoughts blocking off any higher function.DAE experience this kind of thing? does it get better with time? how do you deal with it if at all?,Personality-disorder
51451,Isolation 10 Years Lonely and want Love Hello this is my first time posting on here! Im 26 F and have never been in a relationship. I have no friends. When I was in high school I had one friend but we parted and went separate ways. So the past couple years all I have been doing is listening to music with headphones on playing games watching films and daydreaming about love. I sometimes go out for walks in nature. I wish I could do fun stuff with someone one day. I recently came across someone who Im interested in. Weve talked and they seem nice. We have similar interests but Im afraid of speaking up and telling them how I feel. It sucks having this because my negative self talk wins and I run away from people. Sigh this is hard! ,Personality-disorder
51452,Can you be outgoing and have AvPD? I'm very worried about my brother 29 and not sure how to help him so I've been doing research and a lot of the characteristics of AvPD seem to match. He's my roommate and he hasn't worked in 2 years and just stays home all day on his computer the majority of his time and will not get a job. However his personality is very outgoing and he's like the life of the party when we he is out. He just doesn't want to do anything and my parents said he has been like this since he was a kid. I'm pretty sure he has expressed he feels like he wasn't good enough since he was a kid he's dyslexic so he was never able to get good grades and had to try lots of different schools etc. I don't know how to help him because he says he's fine and doesn't open up to anyone so I really have no idea what's going on in his head.,Personality-disorder

Like part of me was scared so I gave up. Because now I am actually trying and it is getting easier. And Im forcing myself to talk and trying to be open with people and yes its hard as fuck and I still have social anxiety but I am actually doing it. Thoughts? Would it be a lot harder if I had avpd?Its still hard but the thing is it gets easier every time I talk to someone. And I was homeschooled and also had no social contact outside my family for like 8 months so I have a lot of inexperience.,Personality-disorder

I had some nice little projects going on met some great people but then everything just went sideways in my life all at once and now I'm slipping back into being almost entirely invisible again and I don't want to be but it feels like all I have to offer now because of it is negativity right now. In a nutshell a lot of family stuff went down and I even am now having a technical problem with my music project I can't find out the issue of and I'm just spending more and more money trying to fix it. The one thing. I found that I enjoy doing and was finally making progress with completely over the course of a single night went under for me. I swear it's like I'm cursed. Everything I love turns to crap and any good times I have in life are always immediately at some point halted by complete tragic BS. It never ends and I just retreat back into myself again repeating all of the old cycles. Is there anyone that can relate?

51460,Hello new here Hello everyone lurker for a small while now. I'm 24M.I'm in the process of getting diagnosed cause my life is shit and I continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship. Everything points to AvPD according to the psychiatric place I'm being diagnosed in so I figured I'd check out the sub some time ago. I resonate with a lot of people in here so I felt like I'd chip in a bit.I've essentially lived in complete isolation for 34 months now except to buy groceries on sick leave from my vocational school only very rarely seeing family in that time. All social interaction is through online games not that this has ever really been much different which I do think help ground me a bit more in reality. I know that some of you guys have gone years without even that and I'm sorry to hear it. I want to get better finish my education have one or two friends a Roma tic relationship and a job. But life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen seriously fuck living like this.I'm getting a little hope from knowing more about AvPD and that I most likely am about to be diagnosed so I can get help but even still I've had times today where I just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. I'm scared of getting hurt so I've never attempted suicide even though I've fantasized about it a lot. I also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear.Anyways onto more nondeath related shit earlier I ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat. I really hope they got the note cause I look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths. Besides my apartment looks so bad I'd rather not have anyone look inside so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace.That's all I have for today besides all the shit everyone here struggles with I wish you the best possible day,Personality-disorder

51464,The regret of avoidance I've spent my whole life avoiding social situations that cause discomfort. I feel for me personally the end result has been not feeling a sense of fulfillment. This life is so short and we have to make the absolute best of it we can while we are able to. But I let everything fall by the wayside. I let my avoidance control me and continue to fail to accomplish anything or hold fulfilling relationships. Even if I miraculously get it under control I'll still have all of these years I spent in isolation doing nothing of value. I fear that on my deathbed I'll be alone looking back on my life in regret. Does anybody else feel this? That their time has been somewhat robbed by AvPD? I know it falls on me to make the change and that I can't play the victim but the regret is still there.,Personality-disorder
51466,This shit SUCKS cant even freely express yourself and connect with people Being ugly has made me feel like a FUCKING ROBOT. Im sooo fucking jealous of everyone everywhere. Everyone at my job has these personalities that they just express without thinking of how the other person will perceive them. They crack lame jokes witty jokes and everyone laughs and accepts it and they all act like theyre brothers and sisters. Of course Im the fucking outcast who is quiet all the time and doesnt say anything but robotic one liners. BECAUSE I FEEK LIKE THATS ALL I CAN DO. Anytime Ive tried being funny and more comfortable I got shot down so many times. People would say who tf says that shut up or just flat out ignore me opposed to how they laugh with each other and and add on to each others jokesI feel like I have to constantly watch what I say every fucking time Im talking to anyone. People have said kobes weird hes too quiet hes a loner but like Im only quiet cause I feel like people will consider me lame and annoying if I try expressing myself and talking to them its not fair no one else has these fears and Im essentially trapped in my brain locked out from making any meaningful connections The worst part is I dont even think this is fixable. Its been this way for basically my whole life. Like whenever I tried to take a leap and express myself Ive mostly been shot down and looked at like I was special needs and its dehumanizing and isolating I dont know what tf to do. Im so sick of being cursed to ugliness and this sub I just want to live my fucking life and connect with peopleI feel like when YOURE ugly youre not allowed to really express yourself and joke like everyone else because people will automatically take offense to it So unfortunately even tho I want to connect with people I stay to myself cause I feel like Im unbearably boring and awkward and like people dont like me and would rather not talk to me soo fuck,Personality-disorder

In fact we've never met.On new year's eve she was attacked by a mutual acquaintance and she got bummed out and always kept apologizing when she thought she offended me.I felt so bad every time. I broke up a few days ago I dont know if you can really call it a break up since we never even met yet because I felt like garbage and I didn't want her to depend on me since I don't even know what to do to take care of myself.I didn't even have the courage to hear her afterwards.

As someone with a speech impediment Childhood Apraxia of Speech and currently undiagnosed AVPD along with selective mutism Its frustrating that this whole society seems to be based off social interaction. Im almost 18 and realized that I should be looking for a temporary job by then so Im not a complete failure living in their parents house no offense to anyone who does I set high standards for myself. I see everyone else around my age and younger getting the easiest jobs where they literally just have to sit at a cash register all day and they get some good money. Its frustrating me to my core as I can never get an easy job like them as I cant handle social interaction or talking. I try to look for alternative jobs but every single one of them pops up with Requires excellent communication skills or Verbal communication required. Even working as a stocker or in a kitchen apparently requires communication! For the life of me I can not communicate well with people as I automatically freeze up and go into panic mode inside. Even at the small school I volunteer at I can barely even force out a word I just do my job silently before leaving. They probably are only letting me help out of pity. I even considered being a police officer for a while until I realized that you needed communication for that too. Im more fucking scared of talking to people then of tackling down murders. Today my girlfriend was looking for tutoring jobs and I just cried seeing how easy it is for her and everyone else not having to even care about social interaction.

51479,Do you guys ever wonder why you couldnt have just had a normal life like everyone else? My life was normal until my father died at 7 and my mom left at 9. I experienced childhood trauma physical abuse emotional abuse verbal abuse and neglect by the people that raised me. Not only that I come from a strict religious immigrant family so along with all those issues I was never allowed to leave the house much. My family also never went out and did anything and they also never showed me any love or affection.This was my life growing up until I finally moved out at 22. Ive since been doing better for myself as Ive graduated college and have a career now. But the damage was so severe that I dont think Ill ever fully recover. My upbringing made me lonely that I never had many friends. Verbal abuse made me mute and unable to talk back so I cant talk with cluttering. I do not have much confidence or self esteem. I still do this day dont have many friends or much of a social life. I also have a hard time dating and at 28 still have not hooked up with a girl outside is kissing and making out.I look at my life and the look at everyone else. They all had loving caring parents siblings to play with and grew up with all the love and compassion in the world. They have many friends they have boyfriends they have girlfriends they dont have speech issues etc. They just seem to be able to live life normally unlike me.I did nothing wrong to deserve the things that happened to me as a kid as all of it out of out my control. But sometimes I ask myself why me? Just why? I was given only one life on this planet why did my life go like this?

My brain went straight into see I knew you weren't good enough ofc you're not their type ofc they only wanted you for your body nobody will want you romantically It got so bad that I started having physical pains. I had to literally interrupt that mean voice and say woah you're hurting yourself and you need to stop. It takes practice but it's very important to interrupt that shitty inner critic. Its going to look for any proof that you're not good enough and you have to challenge itSo I reminded myself hey maybe this person genuinely meant it when they said they're not ready for a relationship. I had to tell myself maybe they have their own emotional blocks that's stopping them. And I had to refer to my fav quote of all time when it comes to rejection you can be the ripest peach and there's always someone that just doesn't like peachesPlease if you're able to create that positive voice that challenges negative thoughts. It's not a cure ofc but over time you will start to have more compassion for yourself and your inherent value.,Personality-disorder
51482,Avpd Adhd anxiety being an adult. Me again having another midlife crisis? I can't function in life. I have adhd and may have a bunch of other problems so I don't know if it's related to avpd or not. I forgot to take my thyroid hormone two days straight and I also didn't buy my antidepressants for some stupid reason. When I finally went to buy them they were out of stock. So yesterday I was super sad and vulnerable and also feeling physically drained like was going to pass out. Then came the anxiety and crying. Today thanks to my mom I bought my life numbing drugs after being scolded like a kid and I'm having another melt down. I don't know who I am anymore. Am I this mess of a person or is it the drugs? When I'm ok am I really ok? I feel so incompetent so stupid so weak. I can't take care of myself. My house is messy even though I try every single day to make it beautiful I have no job and zero courage or motivation to get one no independence. I feel so scared of everything of being alone in the end and dying alone. And knowing my life depends on me taking the thyroid hormones doesn't help. I need people so much but I'm terrified to reach out and be rejected. I'm afraid my husband will leave me even though he is super caring and loving. I'm afraid once people see the black hole in my chest they'll run away. I shouldn't need another human being like this since I'm in my 30s already. Don't even know where I'm going with this post. I just feel like life is incredibly hard for me but only in my head. I have it easy and I'm struggling to survive and maybe it'll always be like this because of avpd....?,Personality-disorder

That's why it's so important to learn about yourself to be comfortable in your own skin to the point where you feel that you don't have to justify being yourself.,Personality-disorder
51487,Is anyone else full of love but unable to express it? Does anyone else really love and care for those around you but feel physically incapable of expressing it? Not just verbally but by interacting with them at all. I'll go to family events and think how much I love everyone there but am too anxious to join in on talking to people. I feel like people think I don't like them when that couldn't be further from the truth. I'm so uncomfortable and embarrassed by expressing affection itself too. It's like there's this block in my head that prevents me from getting the words out. This is why I know I'd be incapable of a romantic relationship never had one. These things are a crucial part of them but I'm incapable of doing them.,Personality-disorder

51489,i dont think i have the capacity to be a good friend the last time my only friend was in a terribly dark place i left her messages unread for two days and when i finally felt like i could actually handle responding i could barely come up with two pathetic fucking sentences. i appreciate that she left it on read and hasn't brought it up again instead of telling me just how absolutely shitty and unhelpful i was. now she's tweeting about feeling stranded on a desserted island by myself less than an hour ago and i feel like such a selfish disgusting piece of shit but I don't know how to comfort her or be there for her at all bc i don't feel like i can handle it. i can hardly handle my own bullshit. I can't be of any help. I can't even just listen and be a shoulder to cry on good enough bc i'm too much of a coward. i think i just deserve to be alone. to rot. i'm not worthy of connections or relationships. they're meant to be twosided and I can't hold up my end up the bargain. i hope i die alone so i stop hurting people.,Personality-disorder
51490,PMS and AvPD I have been feeling okay for quite a while now I'm hyperfocusing on things that make me happy so my brain is just too busy to think about negative things. However i know for a fact my AvPD gets significantly worse when my period is approaching. My mood plummets entirely I start becoming really mistrustful of other people's intentions I isolate and i completely lose hope in the future. There's also a really important exam coming up soon and I really want to have 100 of my head in the game rather than worrying about how much of a terrible failure I am and how everyone actually pretends to tolerate me but would rather have me gone from their lives.Any advice from anyone who has a good strategy with dealing with PMS and AvPD at the same time?,Personality-disorder
51491,School years Hello Im a teenager that needs to go to school. My scholar first day of the year is close! Got no friends. Its the school I studied at my whole life. I was too afraid to move to a different one. Its my last year of school. First year alone my friend had to goEveryone smh knows me as the weird quiet nerd lonely and more like asocial kid. Its been a year since I got diagnosed with that thing. I made so much sense I thought I could finally move on and magically turn very social and all wrong. I didnt what to be by my self I feel so awkward.But I am scared of people omg! Any advice? I feel like I have nothing else to do but to say no word all day blame myself isolate much moreI like to study. I hate school. I cant socialize no matter what at least say good morning,Personality-disorder
51492,Nobody takes an interest in me so I stopped taking an interest in myself For as long as I can remember all my friendships have been due to me taking the initiative. Asking the other person about their life and making plans. If I stop doing this I stop having friends. I wonder what this says about me. The only thing that comes to mind when facing this fact is Am I that reprehensible?. And I know that sounds like I am expecting things of people but isn't a friendship supposed to be a 2way street? I feel so crushingly lonely when I think about all this. There's this video from Kurzgesagt about loneliness and in that they say that the feeling of loneliness has the evolutionary purpose of saving you from the threat of being excluded from the tribe. If these were the days when humans lived in tribes I would basically be deemed to not be worthy of survival.Every friendship that starts has so much at stake for me. I can't face another onesided thing. It's such a slap in the face like I'm not worth knowing. Which is why I avoid investing myself in anything nowadays.These strings of continuous unreciprocated experiences have left me incapable of taking care of myself. Everything I do for myself feels not worth doing. Even talking about myself feels like a waste of time. If I try so hard to be part of the world and it rejects me why should I care to survive at all?,Personality-disorder

51494,I did it I gave up my old life So yeah I did it. Or atleast I am doing it. I dont't know what will happen next. It was always a distant dream of mine to just leave everything behind. Maybe you can relate.I quit my job and my appartment. I left my cozy first world country with a one way ticket to India. Currently I am touring Rajestan on a motorcycle. The only contact to my old life is my family. Even though I would like to cut contact I can't bring myself to do it. It would break my mothers heart.I eat way too much seriously the food is amazing and get stared and begged at alot because i am a western guy. Some days I don't leave my hotel room. Other days I drive 300km on busy roads. You probably know this feeling. The ambivalence is killing me. I love being alone but at the same time I miss not being alone. And often I think doing this was a big mistake. The whole experience is.. meh.. And because I dont know where to go or what to do planning anything is impossible. Right now I have 50k in savings. But what for?The only thing I always hear in my head is Wherever you go there you are. And atleast that's true.Thanks for reading if you have any questions feel free to ask.

51496,I finally gathered the courage to ask for an AVPD evaluation. Just got a response in my email and I started procrastinating to not open it. I just received an email with an answer and I started freaking out and writing this message in order to delay my opening it. Could that be considered a symptom? lolNow seriously I've never even spoken about this out loud with anyone and I'm freaking out right now. Will I be able to go get tested? It's so silly but I'm afraid I will only have regular anxiety and I'll be embarrassed about making a whole deal about it.Anyway I'll put on some relaxing music and open it... at some pointEDIT so they're sending me a phone number to get in touch with them. Like seriously a voice call?? I CANNOT.EDIT 2 It just occurred to me what if it's a test already? I doubt it but I'm really surprised they asked a possible AVPD person to make a phone call.EDIT 3 I just texted this woman and told her If you don't mind it's more comfortable for me to speak this way. Then she texted me back I'm on the subway now I'll call you asap. facepalm I really need help but I'm starting to regret it right now.EDIT 4 More than a day later they called me and I didn't pick it up. I am bothered by the fact that they should be more sensitive considering they're specialised in these kinds of disorders. Immediately afterwards they texted me and I thought they would have realised and would communicate by text. But the text said You have a missed call from me. Tell me when you're available. sigh I think I'll try to tell my current therapist after all because it gives me less anxiety than changing.,Personality-disorder
51497,Advice for AvPD college students? I'm a sophomore in college and I've totally given up on making friends. My issue isn't with finding a group to fit in with but rather just surviving my classes. All my courses this semester have a large amount of group and partner work and lately I've been skipping or running out of class to avoid it.

51498,Architecture student with AvPD. This is almost like a cosmic joke! This course is definition of criticism. Working sleepless nights on projects overthinking of the negative reviews is constant nightmare and I'm excelling the art of escapism. I'm 23 and this is the THIRD fucking time I discontinued college. THRICE. I didn't know what was wrong with me. I was always avoidant from before I even had the memory of it but I thought that was just my normal nature. I just discovered that I have AvPD from the recurring symptoms. It is destroying my life. It's progressing on the path to hell. It all makes sense now. My choices. My running away. The pattern is embedded deep into my subconscious. I feel hopeless and suicidal. I have never been to therapy haven't talked about it to anyone yet. My family might be supportive although none of us has ever been to therapy before. I'm hanging onto this little hope that I could do better with professional help. It's not too late. Should I tell them or not. Idk. That being said guys has anyone been to therapy or something that has seen improvements for the sake of life?,Personality-disorder

51506,How do you even expose yourself to the public or gain experience when you are 30? I have been hiding from people for so long. Even when I was going to school I was finding ways to hide from the world. I got sad again and randomly searched avoidance on YouTube and one video that popped up was from this guy called Dr. K. I guess he's a popular mental health streamer on Twitch and a psychiatrist who works at Harvard.I don't really play video games anymore but I do think I have an internet addiction. Back in the day I definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people so I do relate to those who have gaming addiction avoidance. A lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me. He talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart. Now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audience's ass but on the other hand I can see a lot of introverted smart but shy types gravitating towards games. A lot of the people I knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people even the lazy ones who never amounted to anything in life.Now the part that I wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life. He mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life so they don't really struggle early in life but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed. Their selfconscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged. Anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance. What a lot of these people don't understand is that they need to gain experience not intelligence in order to succeed. I looked up Dr. K's history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in India. He came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist. So I guess he's proof that fighting avoidance works.But what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already 30 able to do? He had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was 20 and able to come back and succeed. Not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there. Again this could be due to experience and desensitizing himself but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary. For someone like me my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that.I find that a lot of success stories ignore that the people who were struggling were not as extreme as a lot of people like myself.,Personality-disorder
51507,My first day at the job It was awful I hated it and I am so afraid of going in there again.. I don't want to go much into details but the whole day I kept forgetting every fucking thing I was told. I kept zoning out asking a lot of questions a lot of times the same kind of questions again and again being slow because how much I was overwhelmed. I kept telling myself that I am giving it my best it's my first day and no one should expect me being immediately perfect in this but it didn't really help. I needed to do a lot of multitasking to keep my eye on multiple things but it seemed that I just couldn't focus. In the end I felt extremely inferior to all my coworkers. Whenever some of them would remind me that I was forgetting somethingdoing something wrongetc I felt so attacked crushed judged...At some point I even nearly cried but I could suppress it. God I hate this shit. I am aware that 99 of those thoughts I have are completely inadequate and irrational I am certain that they were just trying to help and guide me since I am new in there. But why doesn't it help with feeling less worthless..,Personality-disorder

51509,Generalizing people is ruining me and I don't know how to fix it Just a quick example of what I meanSometimes you're just talking to a person and you're getting along great and you're just in that moment and you're enjoying it in its isolation and you think Wow you now what maybe things are fine and that person says something that just snaps you right back. It's not necessarily political but one example was a classmate I'm getting along fine with who is a woman but is heavily against feminism and once a month goes on a rant about it and it makes me just so exhausted and disinterested in pursuing that friendship. The other is my brother who's like Oh I'm fine with gay people but then yesterday 'joked' about how only the women that look like men are real lesbians I see the 'normal' looking women in lesbian relationships as just experimenting It's so fucking exhausting and isolating. And I live in a fucking racist homophobic shithole of a country to begin with and any time I meet at least somewhat of an openminded person they still have that one thread of fascism they refuse to let go of.And god it's fucking hard not to see this whole country as a country of neo nazis. No matter how much I try to focus on the positives all I ever see is people in ProRussian protest or people attacking alternative bars or spraying neonazi symbols on city walls. It's endlessly fucking depressing. And any time I complain about it to people they all say Oh don't look at it like that. Not everybody acts or thinks the way they think. But it's so hard not to. It feels dishonest and fake not to. And I already have trobules with being social and opening up to people and now there's always this layer of Oh well I gotta be cautious with what I say about what I think because any person could hold back some fascistic views . With men especially. The men here are a whole different kind of intolerant pigs.It's so bad that I'm constantly undervaluing my own opinions and thoughts. It fucking sucks. I never verbalize what I think or feel because this whole culture is built on constant arguments and belittlings and wanting to prove yourself right that it gets so exhausting to socialize. And I want to socialize. I desperataely want a friendgroup and a circle of people I'm comfortable with because I have none of that right now and it sucks because I can't even break out of that caution to even begin to start looking for people. And it's so hard not to filter people through an Ideological Filter because that's always what it boils down to.I don't want to care this much.I want to just fuck off the world and just be me. And I can't. I want people. I don't want to want people. It's so fucking lonely.,Personality-disorder

51514,Honestly do you think the label AvPD does you more harm than good? TLDR My therapist says labels might be helpfulempowering for some but might have a negative effect on others. Theres debates about this in the mental health community. It is in fact harmful for me so I have decided to stop seeking diagnosis for now.Recently my therapist told me how mental health labels might help some but have a negative effect on some.This discussion started when I requested a written diagnosis from her.In my case after discussing labels with her I was able to come to the conclusion that I tend to dehumanise myself because of the label.I treat myself as diseased or nuisance and often feel bad for not being as good as normal people.Theres a whole debate even in the mental health community about labels and how sometimes mental health professionals might misuse it.So for now Ive stopped seeking out a diagnosis.

51516,Contemplating So I've noticed that when I contemplate my inevitable death I feel strange. I can think about if I die tomorrow the next day or amy other time but when I remind myself that it is virtually impossible for me to live past say 120ish it feels different.I think about how nothing I do will ever prevent me from dying and really it is the only time I feel so...human. I feel small and frankly insignificant because nothing I ever do will amount to anything in the face of eternity. A hundred years after I die what should I care? I'd be dead so whatever I do will only matter to others if it even reaches that far. Besides by that point whatever hopes I had that my actions benefited someone is dead alongside me. What I'm getting at is I'm nothing more than a collection of matter that gets some pointless shot at doing something for myself and the other matter blobs around me. It feels very human to me that feeling of nigh nothingness. That is why I'd consider myself religious because it's the voice inside that tells me something as pointless as me is seen and cared about and that the things that I do will matter for the rest of eternity. I know it sounds crazy and people have told me repeatedly that I'm stupid for believing in anything but what else do I have? I've gotten as close to the edge as I could before just to see if I would do it. Clearly I didn't but if I didn't have some hope that my faith is worth it well you know. Anyways what I'm getting at is that I'm religious because it makes me feel wanted like I have a purpose even if it's not entirely clear to me or anyone else really. I hope y'all have good coping mechanisms too because I can take a good guess at what my life would look like if I didn't have my faith.And for those of you who were hurt in some way because of someone's religion I'm truly sorry that you had to go through that. Nobody should have to experience that. And I hope you don't think any less of me for my faith I wouldn't try to hurt someone just because they disagree with me and I don't get to choose how you live your life.At the end of the day I do sincerely hope y'all are doing okay. ,Personality-disorder

51518,I can't fathom getting or being in a relationship with someone who is normal. 1 If I told someone I was 27 years old and never had a romantic relationship in my life and have no friends at the moment they'd run for the hills and I don't blame them. That's a giant red flag and nobody even the most empathetic people want to stick around to find out the reason for that. I'm like an alien in the eyes of most people. How can somebody relate to not doing anything meaningful their lives and having the drive and motivation of a rock. Most people want to strive for something grand... I'm just content having my basic needs met.If someone would even give a freak like me a chance there would be no way they'd be able to tolerate me for too long. As a guy I'm sure the way I act is purely pathetic and cowardly to most woman out there. If she doesn't understand my mental illness she'll see me as not a real man because I'm so sensitive and anxious all the time about trivial things that most people don't even think about.Sorry about the pity post my family thinks one of my New Years goals should be to finally get a girlfriend...

If this was a physical disorder this would've been treated a long time ago. The school doesn't even take my situation seriously. They are basically telling me to get over it.

But it turned out she wasn't as into me as I was her. So its over all for the best. I'm feeling so positive about it. It was painful for the first couple days after no lie but now I feel great.I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to make a move sexually but I did it. It was awkward as hell obviously but I did it. I was bold as fuck. And it was really no big deal. I saw her again the other day and it was totally cool no hard feelings.I finally feel like a real living human being. It's like I've been set free in a major way. Only a year after I asked out the first person haha. Feels like a lifetime ago. I never thought I'd actually get here and I'm so grateful that I did. And I have so much time ahead of me. I'm only 24. I used to look at the future and see only dread and misery but now I see hope and promise. Thank you thank you,Personality-disorder
51538,Do you guys try to avoid people you know or just people you don't know? I used to be anxious about being around strangers but now I don't really care as much. But I always get way more anxious at the thought of meeting people I do know and I try to avoid them as much as I can.I don't even see any value in forming friendshipsrelationships anymore. I try open up as little as possible to people. The more I get to know them the more I try to avoid them.I fear that friendships come with unrealistic expectations and that as people get to know me they'll realise that I'm weird and will gradually dislike me and maybe try to make me feel guilty for not meeting their expectations. I also don't want to become dependent on other people cos it seems like most 'friends' only seem to care about you when it suits them. I just think most friendships are fake and overrated.,Personality-disorder
51540,here i go. im trying to find out my feelings another day. at my core i feel gone like something was never placed there. im 28 years old.i will try to explain it as numb or not there. i dont feel like there is something on the inside of my mind.looking for people who relate or any support. Do you think it has a name its not really depression imo.,Personality-disorder
51541,Idk but now Im moving to a place I never been to. I lived in a place with very expensive rent. I tried living with my family but basically over the last two days everything fell apart. Some of it is technically my fault but more AvPD. I tried living in supported housing but always had a roommate who wouldnt let me sleep. Almost got into having my own room but it fell apart before that. This is pretty much crazy but hopefully it will work out. Im on disability so Im trying to live somewhere I can get a cheap apartment. Its possible I can get a job to make the budget issues easier. For living in unhealthy situations I couldnt hold down a job. Im at least hoping thats the reason. Things with my family were ok before but after Covid there was like an explosion of bad luck going around. Somehow I was used as a scapegoat. Basically scared but also my life was going in a vicious cycle. I had to change something major.,Personality-disorder
51542,I wish I could be assigned a friend or partner so I had someone to share my life with Mostly I wish I could just skip all the scary beginning stuff of getting to know someone. I like having friends but Im terrified of trying to make new ones. I like socializing but only when its not terrifying. Ive never been in a relationship but it seems nice to have someone to be there for you at the end of the day. I only have my family but they all have their own lives and their own immediate families. I just wish that I had someone outside of my family. I wish I had someone that liked similar things and that I could go do stuff with or someone to eat dinner with most days. I just wish I wasnt so scared of trying to get the things that I want. It feels like a pity party kind of night. ,Personality-disorder
51543,Is anyone else ashamed of their face? I hate my face and the fact that people can see me Ive been told I have a decent looking face and good features but it doesnt matter my own mental image of myself is still awful I think of myself like im deformed or have severe facial scarring or something. Its like an inherent and irrational feeling of shame and guilt a constant voice in my head telling me to hide my face that other people will judge me or laugh at me for how bad i lookWhen everybody had to wear face masks I felt great. I was a little more confident going into public spaces and talking to people because I knew they couldnt see my face and what I looked like it felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders now nobody wears them though so I generally wear a hood or hat whenever I leave the house it just makes me feel much more comfortable. I think thats also why eye contact is so difficult because when theyre staring into your eyes it feels like theyre looking right at you judging you theyre able to see your whole faceIdk why I even wrote this just wondered if anyone else feels the same even though its totally irrational and theres no reason to I just cant get rid of the feeling of hating everything about myself feeling ashamed of it all though mainly my face,Personality-disorder
51544,Being uncomfortable with personal compliments A friend complimented me saying I have a good conversation I'm handsome etc. I mean didn't attack me at all the opposite actually so why does some sort of fightflight state come over me with situations like this?

51545,Gave a girl in coffee shop my number I went in for a coffee. She worked there and we got on well chatting and shared alot of info. We chatted for about 30 mins. I tested the water a few times n sort of let her know indirectly that i liked her and things still went well. I decided to just leave it at that and left on a good note I popped by on second day a few days later i was kind of nervous n had been kicking myself i didnt give her my number the first time knowing id have to work up the courage all over again . This time after we talked for about 10 mins i gave her my number i think i came across as lill more nervous the second time but I could of done worseShe never called. i thought there was some chance because things went well but i knew was no guarentee. She was quite alot younger than me but i didnt ask ages. . Still i was pretty hurt. Thats at least the last 5 times iv asked someone out or intended too n i got rejected in some way and them situations dont come around often and always require me to overcome so much anxiety . In all honesty im pretty bitter n sad sometimes at how hopeless my situation feels i cant change alot of things and people just overlook me without giving me much of chance because they see me as a loner or some other thing i cant really change. I may not be the best but im alot more than how im collectively treated. I feel completely unseen,Personality-disorder
51546,A Social Phobic's silly questions First of all I'm sorry for this post I don't want to offend anyone or adorn myself with words that I'm not entitled to.After reading many of your posts and doing some research myself I fear that I might also have AvPD or at least have very similar symptoms. My problem How do I find out if I'm completely delusional or if there might actually be something to it? If I just ask my therapist How do I know I don't have AvPD? it may come across as extremely knowitall and pushy. Aside from that I have many questions and concerns what if I was misdiagnosed because I misdescribed my problems?I'm really sorry to write in this subreddit. It's just that I just panicked again because of an incident.Thanks for reading I really appreciate it.,Personality-disorder
51547,AvPD and Autism Last year I was diagnosed with AvPD by a psychiatrist. Today I was diagnosed as autistic after a 1.5 year process of multiple assessments culminating in a 3 hour assessment today with 2 clinic psychiatrists and an autism nurse. Now I don't know if I am just autistic or if I have AvPD too. Wondered if anyone here has had both diagnoses?,Personality-disorder
51548,I fear I'll never be loved the way I wantneed to be I have this deep longing to be loved by someone who also has AvPD like me who knows and understands so incredibly well about what it's like to be me because we have very similar if not even the same upbringing and experiences that led to us being the people we are today. By this I mean I always think about whether I'll ever meet and get to love and be loved by someone that not only shares the same thoughts and feelings about most things because relationship compatibility but also shares the same traumas. I even maladaptive daydream and have intimate conversations with this nonexistent person about my life and they always meet it with patience and understanding because they're genuinely a good person and they also know firsthand what i am talking about and how I feel.I don't think I would ever go out of my way to search for people who has gone through the same things as I because I'm just not gonna make a post anywhere or go on some friendrelationship making app with a bio saying about what I've been through because I don't want to lay it all out there just like that because that's inappropriate and that I just wouldn't want to open up that way. I would want a gradual relationship to blossom from being vulnerable and building intimacy after a considerable period of time before talking too deep into the worse aspects of my life ya know? As someone with trust issues I need time to be sure i can share all of that.I'm always thinking and hoping that maybe one day I would meet a special someone that would for once make me feel I am loved because they don't have to try to understand but because they just do. I speak from a place that whenever I have spoken and been vulnerable about what I think or feel about anything they don't agree with or understand I often receive a response that makes me feel belittled misunderstood and disrespected. From familial to platonic to romantic relationships I never have felt I am seen or heard with love and patience unless it's something they believe and or know about rather I am scolded or looked at in skepticism or blatantly insulted for merely sharing something as little as expressing an opinion which always comes from a place of being respectful. To even expressing an interest of mine which comes from a place of love and passion gets mocked and made fun of.The very few people I would consider close in my life don't make me feel loved. Sure I feel cared about at times such as my parents providing for me cared for in times when friends would reach out and ask about how I'm doing and cared that I get to have consistent affectionate and attention from my romantic relationship. And yet these people have hurt me and whenever I've told them that they have hurt me they either dismiss my vulnerability of communicating my needs and wants which should be taken as a damn compliment I even talk to them to just being downright disrespectful to me. I thought they loved me. You don't hurt the people you love. I always end up ending the conversation and changing topic by telling them it's fine or nvm or I'll get over it or the worst of it all telling them I was overreacting and that I'm sorry for saying anything and that they're right for calling me out for calling them out... I can't be gaslit but I sure as hell can act like it to avoid conflict don't I? ha ha ha... the things I do for love because I don't want to hurt them even though they hurt me first. It's really not hard to be a decent person especially to a loved one i don't find it difficult why do they? A part of me also thinks the only way I could ever get better and I don't mean outright cured of AvPD but rather just live easier with myself and with other people in this life in a much less difficult way is to have that person by my side who also has AvPD that can truly understand and love me and who'd uplift me and basically all that good things we should expect from being in a relationship whether platonic or romantic. But here i am having doubts that I may not even deserve that and that I should settle because I fear i will never meet that great person I so badly need to love and be loved by.I recently have been reading this book called all about love new visions by bell hooks. It's really given me insight and confirmation about what love really is and one thing I will mention here that is talked about in the book is that abuse and love cannot coexist. It's a hard pill to swallow but it is something that we should talk about more. I suggest all of you to read it it's an amazing book just as the author is. Tldr I've taken up my time to either thinking and maladaptive daydreaming of connecting and having a relationship with someone who i am very much alike with such as sharing same traumas that led both of us to have AvPD. I want and need someone who truly is a great person that not only cares but listens and understands with patience about my thoughts feelings well being and general existence that would make me feel the love I truly deserve because people close to me in my life have not given that love. But yet I fear I will never that and even doubt myself that I might not even deserve that love.To anyone that has read this far thank you for listening and I hope you have a good daynight ,Personality-disorder
51549,My life is wasting away while everyone is building a good future for themselves. It seems like everyone I know is set for their future. My two best friends are currently studying in big reputable schools studying chemical engineering and business something that will help them achieve great goals in the future. While I'm here rotting away in my house doing the same thing everyday because I'm to fucked up in the head to go to school and finish high school. I'm afraid everyone would move on with their lives and I'd have to deop out of school and repeat again. I would be graduating at 20 when I should have been graduating at 18. It would be completely ok if I was rich but I'm not. I can't afford to slack all day and do nothing but my pathetic brain stops me from doing anyhting. Before my country adopted the k12 curriculum everyone graduated at 16 goes to collegeuni for 4 years and graduated at 20. Now I'm barely graduating at 19 years old. It feels like everyone I know is gonna be rich and successful in the future and I'm just gonna be here rotting my life away.,Personality-disorder
51551,Trouble saying I love you Just curious about this. I've noticed in myself that while I can say it to my family members I have trouble saying it to anyone else. I have a few close friends in particular who say it a lot to me and to one another and I just can't say it back for some reason. And it's not that I don't care about my friends it's just some mental block in my head I guess. Saying it to parents or siblings feels more automatic in a way I guess and is therefore less uncomfortable. Such as ending a phone call with love you bye love you too bye.

I like drawing and cooking sweets like cakes cookies muffins and etc. I do have some passions and I'd love to improve my skills and spend my entire time doing this. But I avoid even thinking about going to university because that immediately settles negative thoughts in my rotten brain. What if I embarrass myself yet again?If I am not immediately good at this what's the point of all that?This is gonna be more stressful and exhausting than enjoyable..and so on and so on. I think I do have some sort of potential but I refuse to live up to it. So many obstacles and curves on this path it feels like I am going to fail and eventuality quit at the very start.

51556,Intense fear of failure Today I found out that 'atychiphobia' is the clinical term for the fear of failure. I've been consumed by atychiphobia ever since my teenage years. I've purposely passed up on big opportunities due to it and as a result held myself back multiple times.Well now I've stumbled upon a hurdle that I need to overcome in order to achieve my next goal in life. I've been looking for ways to bypass the hurdle so I don't have to potentially experience failure but I can't seem to find any other ways forward.

51557,Have you ever overshared? If so how the hell do you cope? Ive literally been keeping all my feelings inside for years so its all just been building up and a few weeks ago I had a total breakdown and texted this guy I barely know just telling him about this thing that happened. And hes like twice my age and I just work next to him I saw him a fair bit but I never really talked to him of course because avpd so things were just always awkward. But the thing is he was super nice about it and so then I WAY overshared and texted him a bunch of personal shit and it made total sense when I was sending it and then the next day I was like what the hell did I send this guy? And now I feel SO embarrassed and I just dont know what to do with this feeling. And the worst part is I still cant talk to him I saw him for the first time the other day since sending that text and he was being so nice about it and I still couldnt talk to him. And I might not see him again for a while because my job is kinda changing right now but I just dont know what to do with this feeling.TLDR Got super emotional and texted this guy who I barely talked to a bunch of personal shit. So now he knows that Im messed up and also knows that Im so pathetic and alone that I like him way more than I should and I dont know what to do with this embarrassment.,Personality-disorder
51558,I quit my job without telling my boss So I work as a cashier and this saturday 28th was supposed to be my last day there end of my contract which was going to be renewed but last saturday 21th after my long shift I decided I couldn't go through another week at this workplace so I took all my stuff and left for good without telling anyone.This job has burnt me out so much and gave me panic attacks and I didn't see myself staying there another week. But I was mostly afraid to tell my boss that I didn't want to renew my contract too scared to see disappointment on her face and to let them down... So by quiting early I wouldn't have to face this situation...I didn't show up on Monday and didn't call but I sent to HR a doctor's note from my psychiatrist telling them that I am taking a break from work. My boss has tried to call me yesterday but I didn't respond. I feel shitty right now and I hate this AVPD.... This fear of confrontation and disappointing is killing me.,Personality-disorder
51559,How to know if it's social anxiety or AvPD ? I think I have social anxiety no official diagnosis because getting any kind of official diagnosis is difficult here but it's fairly obvious and several mental health professionals I've seen acknowledged it but I recognise myself a lot in the symptoms of AvPD. I tried looking online what the exact difference between social anxiety and AvPD but I didn't really find anything useful or well explained enough.

51563,Fear is the death of potential comfort it's instrument. Deep down I'm still that poor scared little boy who lost his confidence beaten and humiliated and alone. So desperately alone Beyond that and deeper perhaps is a skeleton where the man should be held together by wishes and fantasies of what it means to be of what it means to deserve and the empty bravado and bloviations of a synthetic confidence made of air. Now I can play the role of the confident man. I can laugh and smile and charm and begile and speak with an iron certainty that brooks no argument and most would be tricked into thinking this is strength but these are nothing more than the desperate craven thrusts of defense a pained and insecure theatre to hide my own inadequacy from inquiring eyes. I feel so worthless so replaceable so expendable. If I am not the absolute best then how can I be valuable at all? How can someone not replace me? How can I feel secure within my relationship with others? Everywhere I look I notice others better than me. People who are better looking taller smarter with nicer bodies and I cannot escape the realisation that these people could replace and take from me everything that I hold dear. I have an adoring girlfriend but how long will that last? How can I trust in permanence when so many better than me exist? When the wheels of fate are always in motion spinning towards a yet unknown destination? Every man man is my rival. Every man is better than me. I must be perfect otherwise I am worthless. Somewhere along the way during adolescence and early adulthood fear gripped my heart. It squeezed and twisted me into submission until I felt powerless to travel any road that was not certain and safe. In persuing safety I was tricked into embracing comfort which came for me in the from of constant daily drinking. For five years I drank and drank and isolated until I was emaciated malnourished alone so desperately alone wasted pitiful weak hopeless and broken. The indifference and apathy that was birthed by alcohol facilitied me leaving university abandoning the future I had dreamed of since a small boy and finally extinguishing the withering flame of hope that I did not know still existed inside of me.I slept on empty rum bottles littering a dirty and dark floor in a small room. I seldom washed or showered or ate and I only left the house to buy enough alcohol to fuel my twoletresaday rum habit. I was so alone so desperately alone. I spent over half a year without any communication with others at all and then only interacted with basic pleasantries in the couple of years that followed. Yet somehow against all predictions I stopped drinking. That was almost two years ago now. Since that moment I have not faltered once nor did I ever fear doing so. I was at rock bottom I knew that I could not drink anymore. The realisation hit me suddenly with force sufficient to stop me mid step on my way to buy rum. A voice in my head clear and confident and smooth stated you can't do this anymore and thus the decision to never drink again was made. And I cannot go against decisions already made in the same way I cannot reverse the motion that broke a glass against the floor. From that moment I have worked hard to build myself up from the creature I was. Now on the precipice of achieving two years of uninterrupted sobriety I have a new respectable fulltime job I workout five times a week I have a loving girlfriend and yet I am haunted by the immutable weight of my own inadequacies and regrets. Everyone around me is more successful than I am. My girlfriend is currently on a buisness trip abroad surrounded by other people of stature significance and importance. And what am I? An addict a university dropout and a worthless talentless static waste of life. I know that I cannot compare my life and success to others. Every person you meet has travelled a different path to yours with different privillages and struggles and a completely different set of potentials. I should only reflect on the life I have lived judging my success by the progress I have made. I understand this logically. It makes sense... Only I cannot help but compare. I want to be more. So much more. I need to be more. I want to go back to university but I fear I am not smart enough. I had no confidence in going in the first place but it was a path I was on so I did not dwell on the fear. Now with the flow of this path disrupted I cannot find within myself the confidence to take the plunge back into formal education. I am inert with doubt. Why is it I cannot move past my regrets? Why do I feel so inadequate?,Personality-disorder

51566,Resentment I have been suspecting about having AvPD for quite some time. Knowing that my inability to have close relationships and function in society wasn't just my fault but is due to a condition conforts me and gives me some pointers on what to do to battle it. I really really really don't want to keep on living this cold walledin hikikomori hell i was in throughout my teenage years and twenties.And boy did I gather all my willpower to try and change my situatuon asking this friend out over and over trying to send them memes to make them laugh and engaging with what they were posting. They ghosted me so I stopped reaching out to them. I gathered that they just didn't want to be around me. It really hurt and I blamed myself for beint unlikable and all. After months I slowly started healing back again and just... Moved on.Recently they came out as having AvPD to me and other friends and I now... sorta hold a grudge against this person. I know I'm supposed to be understanding and all because I've been there i am there actually but also... Fuck no I put a lot of effort and courage in asking them to hang out every week at a certain point I got tired of asking and being constantly ignoredrejected especially in addition to little jokes about how ugly badly dressed and socially awkward i was and how my bf probably cheats on me made me relapse pretty badly. How convenient to be cruel to the jobless lonely loser and then blame it on AvPD.,Personality-disorder

51568,Tendency to shutdown I'm sure I'm not the only one doing this but I find myself shutting down and withdrawing from people and situations to such an extent that I am unable to look them in the eye. It is triggered through different mechanisms but most often than not it is triggered by a situation in which I feel less worthy than what I already am.I have low self esteem and an extremely negative view of myself. Notwithstanding my past having an influence on that view. Some situations may come across as innocent suppose you were friends with someone. Not direct friends a friend of your significant other or a friend of a friend. This friend takes interest in you only at times where they are in your company. Or having a mental meltdown in my case. They never text. Truth be told they never even ask about you.Another example people ask you your opinion about something. You give it thinking it may be of use but then it turns out they didn't even bother listening. Or they brag to you about a choice they made when you suggested it in the first place. You feel like nobody sees you. Nobody respects you. Nobody listens to you.I withdraw and I shut down. Although I can try and look past it I can never truly get over it. It adds to my negative outlook on life and it breaks me down further. Soon there'll be nothing left to break.I feel alone levels that's been elevating over the last couple of years. I don't know if life is truly worth pursuing anymore. Any way don't mind me. Just another rant.,Personality-disorder
51569,Negative selfcenteredness This applies to social anxiety disorder and many other mental illnesses but if the sense of self is so negative it also creates a negative perception of other people and applies it back onto oneself as the center object even if selfesteem is low and esteem for others is idealized. It's important to teach people to have positive selfesteem regardless of what other people but also to challenge the perceptions of other people in the first place.,Personality-disorder
51571,It seems hopeless but is there any way to find a remote job online if I have avpd and don't really have... any redeeming qualities or skills for the market due to lifelong isolation and selfsabotage? I know that people who have their psyche together have an extremely hard time finding jobs too we live in very confusing times. And I'm less employable than most people of my age. I don't have a finished degree I don't have presentable look I don't really have hobbies other than videogames and some niche knowledge about obscure culture things I'm not great at communicating but more importantly I haven't worked or studied in about 4 years at this point so I pretty much forgot how to look and present human at this point. I'm not really interested in anything in the normal sense either due to anhedonia or general dissociation from my own emotions and needs. I'm thinking about therapy as something that could guide me and help me in life I know this is really all eggs in one basket kind of thing but I genuinely only believe in one thing and it's therapy. And to pay for any therapy I need money. But I'm so lost and hopeless in navigating job market I'm practically terrified because I'm a grown ass person and I have never worked in my life before other than one small online gig I got by pure luck and it was a one time thing and it's not repeatable and skills for that don't transfer anywhere. I've heard about things like rev or something like that but they banned my country because of recent world events. I was researching different sort of freelance stuff but I consistently got terrified of having to promote myself or even commit to any craft at all due to selfdefeating attitude my whole life. So in the end I don't know anything don't have any skills other than fluent english and my native language have absolutely no experience of any job whatsoever. It feels incredibly hopeless. Any tips? Maybe some websites that could help with making small money for manageable tasks? I'll be very grateful for any response.,Personality-disorder
51572,Disillusioned by therapy Maybe I'm being too critical but I feel like therapy has not been helpful to me. I had finally reached out for help just before the pandemic and was seeing a therapist. She was extremely nice and it did help finally having someone to talk to. When everything switched to remote sessions during the pandemic it seemed like she rushed through our sessions and sometimes they would be over in 15 minutes. I didn't confront her about this. I ended up just ghosting. I'm not happy with myself for doing that but it's part of this illness I guess. I then went through my local university because I had read they had a good social anxiety program and saw a few a student therapists again all very nice people but I still felt stuck. About a year after seeing a few student therapists I was informed my current student therapist was finishing their program and that I would need to find a new therapist outside of their program. They offered to show me how to find one on Psychology Today. I was already well aware of how to do this and was a bit surprised with how it seemed like they were just dumping me off.I'm 31 years old.

51573,Anyone else idolize friends from their past? I hold onto memories of people who have left me seemingly endlessly. Good ones bad ones. Perhaps because I believe they must be some kind of special person to have enjoyed my company. I think my connections have always been more deep for me than the other person because Im desperate.I wish I wouldnt remember them. Wipe it all clean. Constantly being hit with intrusive thoughts of everyone who isnt around and how difficult those relationships were is exhausting. I had a dream about a close friend who abandoned me justifiably not even my self esteem talking I was a shitty person then reconciling with me over lunch. Extremely vivid and I felt so at peace after our conversation. So glad that she wanted to talk with me again. Then I wake up from this bliss all alone. Go to school alone. Come home and make dinner alone. Go back to sleep alone.Its absolutely crushing to be so alone and feel like you dont have the tools to come back from that.,Personality-disorder

51577,rejection this is kind of a stupid petty thing to talk about but honestly i just wanna get this off my chest. i have a friend we've been friends for like 5 years already and we've basically grown up together. we were both sort of socially withdrawn so all we had were one another and so we'd talk everyday all day. i remember this one time we had a conversation where they told me that they tend to ghost people and slowly pull back when they feel as if talking to someone starts to feel draining or they just don't like the person anymore. lately they've been pulling away like replying less and less and just ignoring me for the entire day. though sometimes they'd stay and have a full conversation with me but it's kind of rare and i get the feeling that they do it only to keep me there like to ensure my stay... kind of like a push and pull. it's not like they don't have time either. sometimes when we'd have a half conversation they'd always and i say always talk about how they're connecting with someone how they had fun with someone new all this passionate stuff and it just stings a bit. by a bit i mean a lot. i know i'm not entitled to their time by any means but like i just feel like i've been hit by a truck. i know they're purposely ignoring me i know they're losing interest in me i even get the feeling that we're growing out of one another. i'm just wondering... what about me isn't enough that's worthy of their time? am i not interesting enough? am i boring? i don't know. oh well shit happens i suppose. i'm trying to fight the urge to isolate myself for half a year because i keep feeling rejected by them.,Personality-disorder

51583,Do you feel that you fit in here? Or on Reddit in general? I've been mostly lurking around here for many months now and I'm constantly seeing posts that make me feel like I don't belong or I'm an odd one out. Like other people think and communicate in a certain way that's different from my own or have an understanding of what AvPD means that clashes with my own or they have fairly ordinary life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me.I don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself if AvPD is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path I've taken through life.Also Reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind' where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. I see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that?If you don't feel you fit in why is that specifically? What details about you clash with what you perceive as the Reddit or rAvPD cultures?And if you DO feel you fit in especially on Reddit in general how does that relate to your AvPD? Is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective something like that? That maskwearing is something I see mentioned a lot here which makes me feel like I don't fit in as I don't do it.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll10kvhz6,Personality-disorder

You people please and bend to their will even if you know it's fucking you over in the long run. I feel like being a fawn has caused me to hate people even more than I should lol. Because when people come around they usually come with some bs that I don't really want anything to do with. Wanting favors wanting me to be their emotional punching bag wanting validation wanting talk at me wanting me to give them stuff etc. I don't have a back bone and it's really hard for me to tell people to kick rocks without feeling guiltySo it just becomes another reason why I isolate myself.

I have a pretty underdeveloped sense of self.While were at it does anybody else constantly smile in social situations to minimize the chances of having to deal with hostility danger or stress from the other person? I just had the thought recently that this is why I smile constantly while talking to people. I recall the first time somebody asked me why I smiled all the time. I genuinely had no idea that I was smiling but that would explain why people are usually cheerful around me! Apparently this is referred to as fawning.,Personality-disorder

51589,Trying to explain the main difference between Social Anxiety and AvPD One of the most common questions on this subreddit is the difference between SAD and AvPD. Lately I've been trying to put it like this Social anxiety I'm afraid they'll see how nervous I am fear of embarrassment AvPD I'm afraid they'll see how inept I am fundamental belief of inferiorityOn top of that AvPD is more severe prevalent in every aspect of life and persistant there's no periods where you DON'T feel it whereas SAD is situational you might not feel anxiety in every social situation and go through periods where you feel lessno anxiety. But the belief of being inferior has to be the main thing that sets AvPD apart from SAD. Because of this deeprooted belief every social interaction everything someone says can be taken as rejection and therefore as a confirmation of our beliefs about ourselves. Even positive situations can confirm these beliefs 'they like me now but once they really know me they'll hate me' or 'they're only pretending to like me'. Another thing is the belief of inferiority often shows up outside of social situations e.g. avoiding doing homeworkwriting essays or even hobbies because you feel like it wouldn't be good enough.Does this make sense? Please correct me if it's too generalizing. I might delete this post later,Personality-disorder

51591,Selfdiagnosis for this what do you think? Obviously I think therapy is extremely important this but I also think it's one of those things that can be selfdiagnosed. With the age of the internet it's easy to get into the mode of selfdiagnosis whether it be for physical or mental illness. But I feel emotionally struck by this it's not a fun thing or something that feels relatable it strikes me to the core and I don't want it to. I don't want this to be the reality but it resonates so much more than social anxiety disorder ever did. I'm not saying that a feeling is an indicator of the truth but I've read a lot about it and continuously have tried to think of ways in which I may not but it fits so well. Beyond on the symptoms I've dung into the roots the commo thought patterns behaviors etc. It's not something I feel will pull me down or become a selffulfilling prophecy because as painful as it's been to learn about it's something I feel refreshed by in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself. I thought I was self aware before but I had a lot of false beliefs and I also have a tendency to detach from my unhealthy and hurtful behaviors.,Personality-disorder
51592,Trying to wrap my head around all of this hear me out if you will So I'm 50 M diagnosed adult with high functioning autism. I have been lurking the schizoid community for some time because I have so much in common with the guys who post over there. Mostly it's the anhedonia that really strikes a chord with me.The prevailing attitude over at rschizoid seems to be this cavalier stance that loneliness is just a preference. Well I take issue with this. Myself I've been isolating on and off so much since even before puberty. Sure it kind of feels good to not have to spend cognitive energy on social stuff. But loneliness is taking a toll on me. My brain operates on use it or lose it and I feel that now more than ever. Especially since covid19.The more I isolate which is something I can do day to day without sacrificing too much in the short run the less high functioning I become. I guess I substitute beer vidyas and parasocially engaging on YouTube for the real thing. It's kind of working but I really miss intimacy and that human connection.

Ive began to develop a hatred for anyone thats not like me. I had a vent account and the amount of people who just didnt understand how severe my isolation was insane. I had so many people telling me you just want to be edgy and I even got called incel on numerous occasions for saying women and relationships make me feel uncomfortable. It felt like everytime I reached out to others on the internet what I thought could be a safe space lmao there was always someone who had to pick me apart and find everything wrong with me. After awhile I gave up trying to reach out and now on other social media accounts I say things just to piss people off. Even if I dont agree with the things I say online half the time I just need to get that rage from some people. I dont know how this fixes anything for myself if anything youd think people telling me to end my life for fake opinions would get me to stop. Ive come to hate almost everyone. As long as I know people were mad enough to send me death threats I feel like ive given them some sort of revenge. I cant do anything about what happened to me in my personal life and I hate it.

Well I don't want to traumatize a 2 year old so I do try to be sensitive to him and his needs. I think putting a 2 year old with a lot of sensitivities in a loud classroom was a bad idea anyway.

As if that's not bad enough it's far from my office which means you have to cross paths with loads of people to get there. For those reasons going for water is always a nightmare of awkwardness and anxiety and I avoid it as much as possible.

51607,Levelsdegress of AvPD Recently i was watching a live of Personality Disorders and this psychiatry said that there is a reason of why AvPD isn't diagnosed enough or clinically useless i didn't like this term sometimes the AvPD is mild so it's confused with a normal anxiety or when more serious it's diagnosed as Social Anxiety. The aforementioned speech makes me real pessimistic about this disorder as iit makes clear that we are really neglected. Clinically useless what the hell? I think that there's a reason for so much misinformation about AvPD the people who know the most about this disorder are those who suffer daily on skin but we can't provide clinical care because we are weakened so there's a big cycle of misinformation and no progress. In short average people cannot understand us satisfactorily. Advances on this disorder will certainly come but I believe it will not be so soon. I hope you guys may have understood my point.

It is very possible that most people with AvPD have healthy brain right?I feel like AvPD is just that we learned things incorrectly we were exposed to some very stressful situations as child and our brains learned that that situation this is bad.And now our functioning brain is reminding us with anxiety that this situation is familiar from past when we were learning things. And this anxiety is causing us to avoid these situations because we were learnt that they are bad.So from this point we can say that our brain is normally functioning?

The attraction is just going to float in the air like a butterfly. Such intense but unattainable beauty. So much out of reach. I am in close almost daily contact with such a man. Its annoying me because I know its hopeless and could never go anywhere but I am addicted to it. Addicted to any little morsel of recognition he gives me. Addicted to making him laugh. It makes my day to make him laugh. He has no idea about the depth of my feelings because I am a person with AvPD and I know how to hide my emotions even lie about them and shut everything down. My brain is basically screaming 'stay safe stay safe.' I don't know who I am more annoyed with me or him. I think making him laugh is the way I make him comfortable with my attraction to him. Its like it must be pretty obvious I'm basically broadcasting 'I don't love you I'm just an awkward friendly doofus please like me.' It is intensely sad to me that this is the closest I will get to love. But even that is addictive. Sad beauty. Sad beauty is better than the grey anhedonia I am used to. I hope this makes sense.

Its not the only symptom experienced by people with SzPD although it seems to be simplified into that.I dont understand the obsessive need of some of the people in this sub to glorify that they are somehow winning against other mental ill people simply because they dont experience social anhedonia.Experiencing social anhedonia is not a intentional choice of people with Schizoid PD.

Share your dreams!I go first I can spend an entire day just looking at a wall I don't have hobbies. My schizo side doesn't stop at my schizoid personality so I can't speak for the entire schizoid sub but if you check there you'll see that we don't like much stuff music is almost an unanimity but besides that... you won't find much so I'm always curious to know what people likes it fascinates me.,Personality-disorder
51628,Do you also don't want to get rid of your AvPD? Because avoiding makes so much sense to you? Do you also actively don't want relationships in terms of wanting to stay on your own amp not wanting to want relationships?

51631,AvPD and Psychedelics Does anyone have any experience with psychedelics? I've personally never done them but I feel like they could possibly be useful in treating noncurable disorders like AvPD in a guided session with a certified therapist.

51633,I just want to be normal I just want to have friends and a girlfriend like a normal person.

This time I got a hair cut what requires me to go in to the barbers every couple of weeks. I normally go 3 times a year max because it's mentally exhausting in every way. my hair is so annoying I have a cow flick and a double crown so it looks funky asf when growing out so I kinda just neglect my appearance because I just don't want to go through going to a Barbers..

I feel very alone which I have a lot of my life subconsciously so its not usually an issue but the last 45 months especially have been intensely lonely.I go the gym try to eat good meditate etc. Some things help temporarily but most of the time Im in my own head. Its weird I get along with most people I come into contact with but also actively avoid a further friendship from any of them.The only pressure I feel to have friends is because its viewed as odd for a female to have no friends. my family members all have friends or people they hang out with..Me I isolate with my dog in my room 247 I even play games alone now couldnt handle having gaming friends anymore. the only person I talk to is my cousin.

51643,How much of your avpd surrounds your appearance? I've been told I'm pretty but I almost never believe it lol. I don't like attention of any kind good or bad. I noticed that I have this weird perfectionism that I have to look good for people. Ofc you want to be presentableBut I take it overboard. I won't leave my house if I feel too badly about my appearance that day. I feel like I'm offending people by not looking good. I'm pretty sure this stems from ofc childhood. I didn't care too much for looks as a kid I just wanted to have fun. But my dad would constantly judge my hair want me to change my clothes so I can look better. Every thing was about appearances with him. He would constantly look at himself even in windows while walking out in public.He'd spend hours getting dressed despite having no hair so I don't get what took so long . I noticed I've picked up the same habits. I care far too much for my appearance when logically I know most people don't care. And if they do care that's kind of weird. Are you like this? How does your appearance play into your avpd?,Personality-disorder

51645,Its like I live in different world In country where I live there were president elections and I didnt even know about it until I went to someone I know and they asked me who I think will win president elections. It was already day after voting and they were just counting votes. I acted like I knew about it but I didnt.Like I dont watch news or anything so I am out of loop in lots of things that are happening and I dont care much about politics honestly.I also cant vote in this country because I am a foreigner here so thats another thing why I dont care about it much. But fk the thing that president elections just slipped through without me even knowing about them I found this to be ridiculous. Because it is always such a big event how could I miss this?I also missed USA president elections I am not USA citizen I live in Europe. I learned that Biden is president 1.5 year later sometime in 2022 summer after he was elected. I still thought that Trump was president lol.I realized that I withdrawn from life too much but it wasnt even my choice. It was also because of COVID and that government forced us to just stay at home. I isolated myself from other people for almost 2 years and now I am trying to go out again and trying to put my life back together.,Personality-disorder
51646,Does anyone else here want a loving caring close relationship but at the same time just cant get comfortable with the idea of being with someone else? Im 28 and soon to be 29. Due to childhood trauma abuse and neglect I grew very up lonely and to this day have never been in a relationship. I tried online dating and met a few people. Unfortunately no one panned out. While Ill admit I wasnt interested in any of them I also just find myself feeling uncomfortable being with someone who knows your close personal life. Ive never really had a close relationship with anyone my whole life. Ive always been a loner and its been my comfort zone. I fantasize and would just love to have a partner who I can spend time with. But I have so little confidence and so worried about being judged that I just cant put in the effort to start a serious relationship. Im a weird loser with no friends and no hobbies even if I have a good career and ok life otherwise. Being close with someone else makes me feel so uncomfortable. I also get exhausted by look at what it takes to maintain a relationship. Im hoping I can get over this one day. Anyone else feel the same way?,Personality-disorder
51647,Have you ever had best friend? From most posts I read here it seems like most of you had avoidant behavior since childhood and it was the same for me.So considering you were avoidant since you were a child you probably had issues making friends since then. So have you ever had someone you called your best friend and they called you their best friend too?I had friend like this we were best friends for about 19 years. When I left for University then we stopped being in contact slowly. We met few times after that but at this point I feel like we are not even friends anymore.But he was my good friend I have to say he knew that I was shy and weird but he always called me out to meet with people.,Personality-disorder
51648,Overwhelmed with everything right now I just started working in my first job after finishing university and I'm constantly worried about getting fired. I also constantly feel like my coworkers hate me. I'm moving out into my first own apartment at the end of the month and I'm overwhelmed with all the things I have to take care of. I'm most likely also not going to see my friends again after moving away and I'm scared of being lonely in the new place. I also have to spend a lot of money on furniture and I'm worried about picking the wrong stuff. Additionally I have to make contracts for internet electricity etc. And what if I don't like the apartment after moving in? I wish I didn't have to make that many decisions.,Personality-disorder
51649,I wanted to be different. So when I was younger I knew perfectly well that my family had issues the only thing was that I thought that it was normal. I looked at my parent's divorce how poor my parents both were my mother's constant struggles with drugs mental health jobs and relationships and figured that there were more kids at school who's parents also divorced so what makes mine any different? I kept going through life made basically no friends and in the fifth grade I moved parents. I switched from living with my mother to living with my father. It was strange as both parents had very different parenting styles. My mother was more uninvolved due to her relationships mental health and other issues. On the other hand my father is very authoritarian and often wasn't home as he spent his entire day at his office. I don't want to keep going on about the messes that happened in my life because I feel like I'm just complaining at this point. I just wish my family cared more. It's strange to think that after all the signs I showed my family did nothing. They didn't stop and think something was wrong because they were so focused on everything else. And after everything I did to try and help my family members too it's like they never considered that I was hurting too. When my brother's depression led him to be hospitalized why would nobody think that hurt me?Or when my dad lost his grandfather and he couldn't hold himself together? I comforted him while my brother though given his condition I don't blame him remained distant.There's plenty more too much that I did that someone else should have done. Children shouldn't have to be adults because their parents are too busy or naive to do it themselves. I know I'm not giving much detail given some of the things I've mentioned so I'm sorry for that I'm just not ready to share those things yet. I want nothing more than to leave my relatives behind and never look back because all I can remember is how they failed me and how I actually believed that they were good people until someone finally got close enough to me to see how bad my life was. I still can't believe someone had to tell me these weren't normal and that I did have bad parents. I grew up not knowing that these bad things were actually bad. I thought it was normal and maybe to some degree they are normal but definitely not all of it. Because I thought how I felt was normal and because when I did try to speak up I was invalidated by those relatives who had also gone through something.Just because I could hide my pain better than them didn't mean they were hurting worse than I was but it sure made them feel that way. I wanted so badly to be different than everyone else because of this. I saw people who were hurting who thought that I was normal so I didn't want to end up like them. If what I was was normal then I promised myself I would watch the mistakes my relatives made and not copy them. I would be someone different someone people would like because I had it all togetherunder control. But I didn't I was just hiding. I wanted so badly to be someone special because maybe then I would feel wanted or accepted. And now because of that it hurts me deeply when people say my condition is normal. I just can't bring myself to believe that this is normal that everyone feels like this. It makes me feel so weak and pathetic. That's why I hid because if I did try to show people that I was hurting then they would just brush me off and invalidate me again. I wanted to be special and now to some degree I guess I am but I don't even know if I want to be. Without this condition why would anyone care about me? But with this condition it wouldn't matter if they did anyway I'll have so much trouble just trying to accept that someone actually wants to be near me for some reason.Of everything that I want I want just a few things.I want to move far away from my family and never see them again so I don't have to be reminded of my past. I want to be a better person who's past doesn't define them that way I can be myself and be okay around other people. And lastly if I can get those other two things then I want to be in a relationship with nice woman someone who will support me and understand that I'm not always going to be okay but I'll still try my best to support her. Of course there's more to a relationship than that but having someone who can be empathetic with me is definitely something I'm looking for. Well that's it for now. I want to apologize for this being so long and uncoordinated. I hope this doesn't make anyone feel bad I know there's a bunch of negative things in this and I'm sorry about that.I really hope y'all are doing well. ,Personality-disorder
51651,I'm So Sick of Thinking Someone Hates Me When They Don't Call Back This has been going on since I was a child. A friend or family member doesn't answer my call and after a half hour I start to worry that they don't care about me anymore. I'm an extremely logical person but can't help following that sinking emotion that has me analyzing all these dooming scenarios that leaves me wondering if I said something that pissed them off or if they figured something out about our relationship and decided to move on. I know better but have never been able to relieve myself. I guess I just cant help but to feed the worry over believing in myself and the people close to me.,Personality-disorder

51657,Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives listening indirectly to their conversations while in public being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost in a way that no one could see me nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.Some of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life just some sort of play or movie.These days I been having the classic I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog idea and daydreams and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature never having to deal with socialization again only brief interactions for let's say buy necessary stuff from other people which I don't mind. I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.I guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection where I could be myself openly and comfortably but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry. I don't have patience for people anymore I'm tired I'm being judgy as hell and I'm activelly avoiding new people.,Personality-disorder

51660,I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer most aspects of the job are too triggering and I cant handle it.Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 030 minutes of work the previous day I have no update to give I panic and have to lie and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame guilt and stress. Its already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do with the code or on Slack has a timestamp a notification and is visible to everyone. Once theres something Im avoiding committing code deploying code posting the code for review responding to someone testing code an upcoming meeting etc. I often go offline from inactivity and then Im afraid to even open my laptop which can take hours to overcome because once I do everyone can see Im online on Slack my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people Im not responding to my manager.I already got in trouble for not doing my work missing meetings not responding to people for days or weeks and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a monthlong probation which Ive gotten past only because I didnt ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend Im struggling way less than I am. I cant admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing or how much communicating with people the most important part of the job so fundamentally terrifies me.I know every trick in the book about procrastination time management breaking down tasks but thats not enough when Im this afraid of people. Ive accepted I need help from another person. Ive talked about this some with friends but none of them understand so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and Ive been trying to find a therapist but theyve all been unhelpful many actively harmful.I know it's a slow process but every single day at work is like torture and Im on very thin ice. Because I cant get the work done its not endurable and I dont have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I dont want to quit because I havent been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job for the same reasons. But I cant stay like this for months until I find someone and begin making progress.I dont know what to do,Personality-disorder

51662,How to deal with inperson avoidance? Hi dear community!I have a question my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.And I noticed that when hes going through an anxiety episode or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.For example if he feels embarrassed or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will hide behind his laptop or walk behind or in front of me distancing himself physically while still being kind its more of a way of hiding from me when he cant actually leave. For example when we share a hotel room on vacationI did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking that he does reciprocateeven when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me but Im not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it or if he likes it that Im gently being reassuring and consistent.My dear AvpdErs when feeling low do you like being comforted or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!Thanks everyone !!,Personality-disorder
51665,An absence of social pleasure social anhedonia It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone elses body but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. It is rare that I enjoy a persons company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people I cant deny this but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. To say it different I dont feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default being alone is peaceful and ideal. Is it really anhedonia or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I cant feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others.

51675,Feel like a leech Sometimes a song stops me in my tracks and this is one of themhttpsm.youtube.comwatch?vWjxIuZVgjp8.My mother would tell me Im exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. She called me a sociopath someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my familys lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldnt know about. Its been the foundation of all of my relationships with others and helps explain why I get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. Trying to connect while thinking Im secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that Im taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. That everything I say is actually calculated and manipulative despite me being unaware of this. That my side of the story isnt just shameful and wrong its evil and vile.Avoidant with BPD is contradictory hell. Im hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships I can keep so they dont leave me. Im unbelievably stressed because Im so close to disaster. I hate to vent to my best friend of several years because I feel like Im being too greedy of her time. I feel like Im sucking off all the meat of this relationship taking up the space for my troubles and then I dont even improve. I know shes going to leave when she discovers Im actually a terrible person and that I dont change. I can feel it creeping towards me and I want to die.I feel like shes only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like Ive somehow manipulated her into thinking Im a nice person. I feel like Im so much worse than she thinks. I cant understand why someone would care about me other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I cant believe the situation Im in. It happens every single time and I never learn.I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like Ive done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth.

51678,My first therapy appointment in a long time I have had bad luck with therapists in the past but decided to try again. I am mainly going to overcome a fear of driving. I have driven before back as a teenager and the process was going well but there were some things that happened that then hindered it. Before in therapy I didn't have specific goals and I don't think that helped.,Personality-disorder
51679,I got in a bad car accident the other day and the worst part is having to talk to insurance people on the phone maybe this isnt the best place to post this but literally why am I like this? I couldve fucking died and Im more scared of talking to people on the phone. maybe Id find it a little funny if it wasnt so pathetic. arent normal people supposed to be more traumatized about the actual crashnear death experience? meanwhile Im over here basically having a panic attack over having to talk to people over the phone about it. this is ridiculous.,Personality-disorder
51680,I think I have AvPD avoidant personality disorder I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off Im very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping. I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. Im not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level. I dont really open myself up to anyone. Im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. Im close enough with my parents that I dont get anxious around them however I still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. I have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. Whenever Im at work I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience I overthink everything and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like Im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when Im asked questions and I dont feel like Im much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by. I play it safe. Ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like its more than just that.,Personality-disorder
51681,Anyone else terrified of dying alone? finally found the will to post here after years of lurkingIve been living alone for all my adult years and I work from home. I dont have any kind of social life and can easily spend several weeks without seeing or speaking to anyone. I do have family but they all live far away and I dont see them often.So sometimes I cant help but wonder what would happen if I ever have a stroke or a heart attack or if I fall down the stairs or if I choke on some food I often read about people being found dead in their home several years or even decades after they died and deep down Im convinced thats how Ill end up. It really makes me feel scared and helpless and I dont know how to cope with it.,Personality-disorder

But beyond that its like I have no personality. The only reason I can survive my office environment at work right now is because of an actual real and positive coworker. She has the personality that I wish I had easy to talk to and very kind. But shes leaving tomorrow.So Ive been faking my entire self.

51686,I'm screwed maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.The average person is socially active whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.I'm incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career life experiences life skills energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,Personality-disorder
51687,Does avpd stem from childhood trauma? Hi lovely community! Im quite new on this forum! And just wondered if the origin of this is similar to what people refer to as an avoidant attachment style in which a lot of sources claim its due to neglect from parents in early childhood.What triggers avpd or what is the kind of trauma that sparks it? From what Ive read so far its not something you are born with but rather develops with age?Please correct me if Im wrong!,Personality-disorder
51688,Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. Even then the relationships I do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.,Personality-disorder
51690,Storytime... Hey so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there most of us are still there let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. Alright so I was showering thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!So basically I'm part of a church group and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't liketrust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. Though I don't share everything these people are genuine and kind and they always make me feel safe. It's just that I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me. So as part of going on the trip I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team 9 people including me. I trust love and feel safe with everyone on this team and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. Anyways the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small mostly funny slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles my past my family all of it. And these are my friends they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though the medicine is kind of iffy really. Anyways I'm super anxious about it especially since I did something similar last year but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year I was so empty and emotionless. But of course nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. But it's not like that that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy. I'm much better now but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay but as soon as I was behind closed doors I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though everyone of us is sharing our testimony no matter how much it hurts we're going to be here for each other.If you've actually read this far I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you. And if they don't understand that then know that I am thanking you for the kindness you have done for me just by reading this. Thank you.,Personality-disorder

51692,this disorder has stopped me from pushing myself for the better me. Was scrolling on tiktok when I saw my previous school mate 2 years younger than me on my FYP. She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby her father was also a race car driver before helped her achieve big things but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. My best friend is so fckin smart she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart all of his grade averages are 95 100 is the highest in my country. I'm surrounded by smart and talented people with a future people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself while they're here working their ass off for their future.My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away. I'm gonna be 20 in october my teen years are finally over. I didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are supposed to experience. I can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.,Personality-disorder
51693,Do you think this a good description of our experiences? This is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called On The Outside Looking In by Daniela Grazia about her experiences with social anxiety. Ive used it to describe my experiences to others but I have both social anxiety and AvPD so I worry if Im not explaining from the correct side ?. Im also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two. I suppose it only matters in my head but it does matter.The quote one long one formatting issuesgtIt is a feeling that comes over me often an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die. In classes in coffee shops in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. It is the profound feeling of alienness.gtAt any moment in the group conversation something in me snaps. I look around the table at the other people blissfully talking and I do not feel like one of them. I am not one of them. I am different a foreigner an alien a stranger in a strange land.gtAnd then the urge to run away to hide to be away from the people comes up. Sometimes I fight the urge and stay on hiding my vast discomfort. Other times I do run away cursing the cowardice and the shame miserable in my misanthropy but secure in my solitude.gtThere is something in the faces in the voices of the others that I do not have. They are into the conversation. They live outside themselves I live inside myself. They talk listen and laugh I think listen and smile.gtThey are relaxed. I am not. I am never relaxed except when Im alone. Solitude is the only place where I can ever truly be known.gtYet I am not content with this. For the real me is lonely desperately lonely longing for intimacy friendship and love. I long to be able to relax to laugh to talk and converse amiably with other human beings. But I cannot. I idealize them in private and fear them in public.gtFear...fear drives the haunted mind. Fear tortures me gnaws at me and chases me from nearly everything I crave the most. But not even fear can conquer the longing the desperate longing the aching striving for meaning in life for something other than the endless nights alone and unhugged the dreams unshared the life unnoticed.gtWhen I am alone I wish I was other people. When I am with other people I wish I was alone. This contradiction is slowly but ruthlessly destroying my soul.,Personality-disorder

51696,How can I function with unwanted thoughts that don't go away? I am 22 years old and male. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and I relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with. I spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts. Can anyone relate? How can I function like this?,Personality-disorder

51700,How common is this for people with AvPD? Sorry I'll try to keep it relatively short.I'm a 31yearold male and I've never been diagnosed with AvPD but while reading about the symptoms a month ago things finally made sense to me why I act a certain way. I thought I just had some kind of social anxiety when I went to therapy several years ago but I've felt that there has to be something else since I started feeling different in middle school. I've avoided people responsibilites and have taken jobs where I can mostly avoid interpersonal communication. I do still have close friends a great family and a girlfriend but I still have this urge to selfisolate and be alone. However I do try to help people whenever asked and I try to do well at my workplace. Right now I have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion 13 years along the line in a position that I could basically hold for the rest of my working life. But it would surely involve a lot more responsibilites speaking another language I don't know too well I live in a bilingual country where I speak the minority language a lot more and of course a ton more interpersonal communication. I've searched and applied for other jobs recently because my current contract will expire in a few months. I'm much more inclined to take a temp job for 1 and a half year with something I like more and less interpersonal communication than a potential permanent job position. It probably sounds crazy for most people if they heard this but this is genuinely how I feel. I let my feelings of inadequacy and wanting to avoid people control me instead of doing something that could secure my future. Is this at all relatable?,Personality-disorder

Lately I've been spiralling and posted sad angsty posts to people who don't care about me. Thankfully I got only 60 friends. Facebook made me feel more alone. I'm disabled and I don't go outside and I struggle with texting. I just don't get it. I don't have the energy. I kept deleting my posts feeling more ashamed. I need it for something that's work related and still ongoing. But enough. I don't care if everyone is there I rather not feel like a burden and vent on Reddit.

I'm getting older and I hate how much I keep needing to interact with people I don't have anyone in my life other than my parents but even they are on my last tiny nerves... except we've been needing eachothers help a lot. They're old and need help I'm getting older and sometimes need help when im getting sick or life happens. This flop era is turning into a flop lifetime. I'm drained seeing people. I just want to wake up 1 day in my own place and hear complete and total silence never cross paths with another human being never make eye contact or play the dumb game of social interaction and just have enough... stuff to get my needs met.

51704,Do you also feel this way? I just really came across with this term avoidant personality disorder on Google by searching why do I want to be alone and live on my own away from others and I clicked on the very first article that came up. I couldn't give much clearer description of myself after reading the article and so I looked it up on reddit and surprisingly a subreddit exists dedicated to this. I desire to be alone and living on my own away from my family and people because I feel inhibited by them. I feel like I'm restricted and couldn't act my true self when I'm with them maybe because I'm afraid of being disliked by them? I'm not really sure and I'm still learning and knowing about myself.

It's downright disturbing how many times this has happened in my life and it's depressing to think that those opportunities are few and far between now that I'm out of the primary environment they occur school. I was so desperate at one point that despite having everything people normally strive for great career money success etc. I thought about joining the army just to meet people...

51708,Dating apps even harder with AvPD Disclaimer I dislike dating app culture in general.

If I am attracted to someone and there's even one thing on their profile that I lack or don't relate to then I won't swipe on them either. If there's someone I'm attracted to and there's nothing problematic in their profile I won't swipe on them because I doubt they'll be interested in me. In the end this leaves a very very small pool of people which I guess makes the whole thing pointless?,Personality-disorder
51709,My friend expressed that she is disappointed in me. Long story short I felt tired and anxious and wanted to go home and skip one class. I didn't show up for this class in forever and didn't turn in much work so she was worried I'd procrastinate like I did in 1 semester and fail.When I said I'll probably skip again she looked at me with so much disappointment and said I really should stop caring about people that much.It didn't register then but it hits me now how hurt I am from her words. It feels like I'm not doing good enough and I probably am not. So that day I forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. But I can't get the look on her face out of my mind.To be fair to her I said I needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. So maybe she didn't think I felt as horrible as I did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.,Personality-disorder

I spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza it was good though lol I didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake also good. I was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my momI dont have many friends besides a few online friends and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me. When I see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry. My friend says everybody cares and loves me but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their livesTo make this worse my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her.

51715,Is freezing during a conversation an AvPD symptom? Hi all! I'm new to this subreddit I was recently diagnosed with AvPD. I'm trying to understand it and come to terms with it.The thing is I don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks I know like my colleagues and friends I'm even morethanaverage social.However I do notice that I'm... slow in social interactions. I mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and I can't answer properly in the moment. Or I can't hear someone properly but I'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves ?! so I just kinda freeze andor act as if I heard what they said and the conversation goes on. Then later I think of a correct reaction and can't for my life understand why I shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then.This happens with friends too although it's more common with folks I'm not that comfortable with. Is this an AvPD thing or just a me thing?TLDR Is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an AvPD thing?,Personality-disorder

I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder afraid to leave the house by myself reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.Nothing really brings me happiness except substances and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and I've been mostly sober for a year.I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70 of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.I don't have many friends and live in a small town so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked I've tried so many treatments but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.And I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help that I don't know if I can find.Please if you can relate at all or have any advice please please respond. lt3 I'm desperate.,Personality-disorder

51720,Inner monologue is brutal One problem I have with criticism and people offering it is that I've heard it already. A lot. From myself. I think the worst things about myself to myself constantly. The other night I told myself that I'm nothing more than potential. The reason I'm lonely is because no one wants to wait around for me to finally decide to be a reality. Im walkingempty promises. That encompasses a lot. So when someone wants to tell me about myself it feels like a rerun. And they hate that. Hate that they can't get their issue off or add their redundant nugget of truth. Idk if that's part of avpd. And its coming off as arrogant. It's not the critiscm itself. I don't mind. More fuel for the fire. It's the attitude that erupts in response to me being unphased. I always feel like I'm preparing myself for the worst possible things so I'm not as affected when they happen. Being one step ahead of anyone trying to hurt me. Sorry if this has been discussed. I'm in and out a lot.,Personality-disorder
51721,how to get over fear of therapygetting help i'm 18 and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but i'm so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as 'what if i misinterpret a question and answer wrong' or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful. i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist. i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it. i want help and i don't want things to get worse but i don't know how to go about it. any advice on how to overcome this fear or services available that i should start with?i'm from the uk btw,Personality-disorder

51724,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure egodystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are egosyntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? Like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality-disorder
51725,I hate myself so much I met this guy on vacation and we hung out for two days at the pool. I'm a very socially anxious person but with him I felt like I'd known him for years. One night he told other teenagers that he liked me. They told me and they were hyping me up saying stuff like oh look your boyfriend's here. I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. I was bullied at school for being the quiet kid in class and I would run to my parents hoping they'd comfort me. But they'd get mad at me for being so quiet and they'd blame me too. I used to go up to my room at night and sing myself to sleep someday my prince will come. Now he was finally here. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend and got mad at our friends for telling me.He cut off contact with with me. I was so sad that the one person who saw me for the good I have to offer still gave it up. They broke up two months later and he looks at my social media. We're not in contact but according to my friend a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. Im not angry at him for being loyal. Im angry at him for thrusting me into this situation. Im sure it wasnt easy for him but I was the one that suffered the greatest. He got to choose between two girls. His girlfriend is a victim too but at least he tried to make things okay with her. And me? I had no intention of getting in the way of a relationship. I just thought I finally fell in love.,Personality-disorder
51726,Appearance and AvPD It seems superficial almost but my severe acne is contributing a lot to my avoidant tendencies right now. I'm doing everything in my power to treat it dermatologist prescription acne cream antibiotics clean bedding clean diet daily showers face wash etc. It just seems to get worse every day and it is some of the worst I've seen. I'm talking big red cysts. At this point I'm convinced my lithium is causing it.I was making decent progress too. I was going to groups and started volunteering to get out of my house and around people again. I'm trying to work up to going back to work. But I just can't bring myself to keep volunteering looking like this. If I go out of my comfort zone while constantly concerned about how I look and feeling gross I feel as though I'm doomed to fail. If my mental state begins to slip it triggers my hyperhidrosis and then I pretty much have to bail. I'm kind of just stuck in a period of regression after making some strides. I don't know what to do it just feels hopeless. Between severe cystic acne and hyperhidrosis it is so fucking difficult to put myself into social situations. It's much safer to just hide away and wait it out but each day that passes is another day I've lost.,Personality-disorder
51727,Respond to my text immediately or I'll think I said something wrong I never let the ppl I talk to know this. That would just be manipulative and rude but even if we been texting for years good friends and have been in a nonstop convo the past 5 hours my heart still races when they take longer than usual to respond. I think oh fuck I said something wrong. I always say something wrong. I can't ever say anything right. I'm such aThen they'll reply. I chide myself for being so silly. Then do the same thing 40 more times within the same conversation. You'd think being proven wrong so many times would fix it but no. I always think Ah this is the time I fucked up.

51729,The worst part is the lack of hope Im always gonna be like this. Even with years of therapy and meds even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing and anxiety reducing drugs Im still too socially anxious and awkward. Sure I can force myself to socialise but I cant force myself to enjoy it or force myself to relax and just be myself. The fact that this shit isnt getting any better no matter what I try is so demoralising it makes everything else pointless having severe avpdsocial anxiety really does infect every little area of your life. I cant hold a job I cant make friends I havent talked to a girl in years never mind having a relationship. My anxiety is so bad I get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen or hearing others use voice chat in video games. And as I said sure I could force myself to get out there and maybe make friends or a gf but I cant force myself to enjoy being around them. Id be constantly stressed out tense unable to relax. Id have nothing in common with them I only ever feel comfortable alone. Living with a brain like this is like torture craving connections and feeling horribly lonely but being unable to actually make any connections or function in a social situation. Im technically an adult but I have no independence I still feel like a child and I know for a fact that if I keep on going my future is nothing but boring bleak and lonely. Whats the point of going to an awful stressful job everyday if my days off are just as bad. My hobbies are just escapism I dont even enjoy anything anymore Im just so tired I really dont see the point in going on when my brain is this fucked up and my future is inevitably empty and alone. Im barely in my 20s but Im certain I wont make it to 30 its so crazy how fucked up i am avpd is so awful it robs you of a basic human need but still leaves you with the desire for it. A longing hunger that can never be sated the empty void inside my only gets bigger things are only getting worse. No heartbreak or feeling of loss nothing to even look back on theres just nothing.

51730,This is a bit of a weird question but does anyone else relate a lot to these anime titles? Mushishi Kino's Journey etc I've always wondered if this is something AvPD adjacent. Mushishi Kino's Journey Spice and wolf Girl's last tour Serial Experiments LainThey are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.Does this make sense?,Personality-disorder
51731,All I am is a useless burden I volunteer at a place that I like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because I like helping people plus Itll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days I didnt show up due to sickness. Now im supposed to text them when I dont show up my manager? boss? made that very clear. She even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that I absolutely couldnt take phone calls due to anxiety. Now I may or may not have just skipped that part as Id hate to bother them with a text plus its embarrassing. So basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that I cant keep not notifying them when I cant go and I have one last chance or shed rather have me not help out at all. This of course I soooo badly wanna say traumatized because it feels that way but ive experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasnt actually traumatic really hurt me. All I wanted to do was help. I just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all I did was end up being a burden. I hate myself for this im scared to even go in again. If I cant even hold a volenteer position im sure as hell arent ever going to be able to get a real job when I get older. I fucking hate this disease its taking my life away.,Personality-disorder
51732,Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I selfdiagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic paranoid insecure and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my trauma is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did but they felt really sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself and nobody did for me.This person lashed out at me calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and honestly that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.This person wasn't wrong but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back it felt nasty and unwarranted.Still though it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends a few years since those bad exchanges occured and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my selfesteem and it still does.When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like I wanna die to myself like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more normal again though.Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered offtopic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.,Personality-disorder

51736,Does anyone find it so hard to get over a commentcriticism to the point they feel suicidal? Trigger warning. Mention of Eating disorders and suicide. A month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned 30. He was saying how he didnt look 30 and he pointed to me and said he looks older than me. Im 24. It felt like a stab in my heart. Ever since Ive barely left the house. I wasnt trying to date before that but now Im not even going to try. I feel suicidal now and I dont feel like lifes worth living. Im old looking for my age so I should just give up. That comment is running through my mind 247. Its torture. I feel so embarrassed. If my brother knew what that comment did to me it would suck. Im so angry but hurts. Its not really his fault how I feel but why did he say that. Ive struggled with eating disorders my whole life. I get anxious seeing my brother because Im scared of what he will say. Everything reminds me of that comment. I have barely been eating. It just reminded me why I shouldnt leave the house because other people will think the same. It feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but its taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday.

Thought it might bring more awareness for yall especially for the ones who are unofficially diagnosed and highly suspect they may have it. Although I have enough clarity to know I have it undiagnosed this is hands down the best breakdown and description of each possible symptoms that come with it. Never heard it like this before. It's not like your typical DSM5 avpd symptoms that are more generalized and broad. This is more in depth and even more eye opening since I resonate so much with all of them.

51742,Anyone else lie as a child? Not sure if its an AVPD thing but growing up I told a string of lies to all of my very few friends. It weighs on me almost daily. Some were really horrible like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. Of course thats not real. I cant believe I said those things to people but it felt like the only way at the time.Through a lot of reflection I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person because I didnt deserve them. But nothing in my life that I understood at the time was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if youre not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge its not a valid mental health condition. I didnt think I had any reason to have the problems I did so I had to give people fake reasons to make them believe it because my parents told me thats the only way.Also somewhat of a test like if they stay for this horrible person Im pretending to be theyll surely stick around for who I actually am if thats better. And its not hard to be better than that given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave then Ill have been in control of the rejection. And theyre not reacting to the true me anyway so the judgement doesnt hurt as badly. Avoiding the spotlight by pretending to be another person.,Personality-disorder

Because of her disorders she constantly bullies herself every day on everything she does and thinks she's the worst person alive. She's very sensitive too so one little thing can ruin her day and cause her to drink. My parents are separated but theyre both on good terms and still talk. On top of that Im struggling with myself too and I think Im stressing her out. I'm only 14 so what can I do to help her? She tried many antidepressants and other treatments but said that none works.

I finally got an appointment at psychologist we were doing for the first few hours screening process turned out I do have AvPD and I met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with BPD. Also he mentioned that I do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. But after I read his diagnosis this evening he wrote that I have Other personality disorder. Which idk how I feel about that. Like I do not belong to anything even in this. And when I started to talk to him about feeling really depressed and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today he just said that we will talk about it next time in a two weeks. And I am so confused about this like no one really care especially with the suicidal thoughts. And feeling I do have no one to talk. Or maybe I dont want to? I dont know.

51754,Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD I don't date much and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. Hes a empathetic person that cares for other people but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95 sure he's gone to therapy because even though he will explode at the most random times there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.Before we dated I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly a few weeks before he was flirting with me but I didnt pick up on it. So when I invited him it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter that I dont follow he was saying stuff like playing with peoples feelings is bad and disloyal people annoy me. The next several weeks he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.Hell also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really arent a big deal.

51756,Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart and attractive and I care for people but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my first love?The first guy Dave I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side. We only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. The second guy Steve I met a year later at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives. We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wpn90,Personality-disorder

51761,Out with friends for the first time in a long time.. cant leave.. Went out with an old friend for her birthday in a city two hours away from where I live. Things were going well but Im getting the feeling I annoyed everyone and no one wants to hear my voice anymore. I cant excuse myself and go home and I also feel rude saying Im going to bed first. Im the only single person here and theres so many years of bonding and inside jokes Ive missed out on. You know when at the beginning of the night everyone seems happy to see you and laughs at your comments if youre your lucky but then everyone slowly stops replying to you and distancing themselves from you as the night goes on. I also got overstimulated and frustrated very briefly not at anyone in particular but now I just feel like I overstayer my welcome. Im stuck here until tomorrow morning when we go home and I have no one to talk to because this girl I came with is my only friend. I feel like shrinking and making everyone forget I was ever here.,Personality-disorder
51762,I'm not the friend people want. I'm not great at connecting with people. I understand social cues but I guess people find me weird or whatever.

51766,Im mostly so avoidant due to being ashamed of my appearance and feeling like I dont belong. Anyone else feel the same way? Im a below average looking guy and I just want to be normal looking. I feel like my AVPD has gotten worse over time because I am just too ugly for life.,Personality-disorder
51767,suffering from AvPD as an ugly guy is like a cruel joke sometimes I can't believe i'm in this situation lol it's like a nightmare. You know nothing is gonna change even if you cure this sickness because you are ugly and getting excluded is a natural procces for you.Edit Posting something like this was a miskate. Looks like when you are an ugly man you can't talk about your problems and when you do people tell you its all your fault and you have a shitty personality you cannot say the opposite otherwise you will get downvoted to the bottom. Thanks to our helpful users here today i learned i'm a sexist schizophrenic guy who has some personality issues and treats other people like shiteven tho they dont talk to me for more than 10 seconds.,Personality-disorder
51769,Does anybody else feel like they know their symptoms understand how their brains though process work but still feel hopeless at getting rid of AvPD Im a very introspective person I always observe my actions and thoughts and how I interact with other people i can see Ive got a negative feedback loop with SAD AvPD and autism traits which destroys my self esteem which means I always have bad intentions and conversations with people but im just so confused and leaves me feeling hopeless as i have no idea how to change,Personality-disorder
51770,Making changes in a terrible depression Tw lightly suicidalThis week I have to begin fixing my life. I dont have a choice in the matter. I will need to see a new psychiatrist and a new therapist. I need to get a job I need to eat. I have so much to do to fix myself before I can even start with the basics of life. And worst of all I have to be honest to heal. Im not even honest with myself. I just smile and nod to everyone. No one takes me seriously because Im always laughing and joking. I cant turn it off. Like when your parents say keep making that face and itll stick that way forever I got my face stuck in a clown mask.I feel like a shriveled dehydrated soul. Like a sewer rat crawling out of the soggy drain. Im horrifically depressed the worst of my life. And honestly the effort just doesnt feel worth it. Id really rather just rot and die. Im so terrified of all this Id prefer to die. But I couldnt make that choice either. I am trapped on all sides.,Personality-disorder
51771,I recovered from AvPD. What will help others? I dont believe in matters of mental health ever truly being 100 cured.Even though I still have some AvPD traits that Im still working on my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.Ive gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.All through school people called me socially retarded and my mom thought I was autistic.To now being a very socially skilled confident outgoing person who makes friends easily.Im curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how Ive recovered from my AvPD what helped me how long it can take etc?I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible and spreading that false message. It is possible! Its just really hard uncomfortable takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? Im also open to suggestions of what else could help.P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry skeptical reaction or think Im being narcissistic. But I wanted to take the risk and reach out anyway because Im super passionate about recovery and Id love to see the negative narrative about AvPD recovery start to change.,Personality-disorder
51772,I look like how I want to. So this is actually something really positive for me even if it isn't considered the best thing in everyone's minds. I was going to the bathroom and I was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days. The pants used to fit me just fine but I've lost so much weight that I have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off. Anyways what I'm getting at is I saw myself in the mirror when I walked in and I couldn't help but think that I look exactly how I want to look. I love how comfy clothes look my hair is long and messy and I guess I'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. I am embarrassed that as a guy I like feeling cute but I think it's great and I've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. But when I was admiring myself in the mirror I lifted up my hoodie no I don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies the temperature much too hot for that as I can barely wear this hoodie and I saw that my waist was super skinny. Of course I don't eat much and I still function fine so I guess that's okay. What I'm getting at is I was able to look at myself in the mirror today and I liked what I saw and people can think what they want I look exactly how I want to look today and I love that.Things have really been getting better for me and though there's still plenty of low points I can easily see my condition is getting better. I hope everyone else is doing okay and I hope that by sharing this I can bring some hope to anyone else who has been struggling with this pd.

51773,People telling me to calm down instead of understanding my pain DAE experience this? No one takes me seriously when I say that stuff that's happened to me has negatively affected my mental health. I'm basically told to calm down stop worrying even if it's really affected me. Basically just a refusal to accept and acknowledge that I've been hurt.I think is partly why I have avpd to start with. I guess this could be classed as some form of emotional neglect not having my feelings validated or taken seriously to the point where I've had to deal with my trauma by myself.,Personality-disorder

Hello lovely communityIm reading a lot about this mainly to understand the guy Im dating better who has AVPD!My lovely community please help me understand why it takes often over 24 hours to respond to a text from your loved ones?Is there specific content that triggers you to avoid replying I.e expression of feelings? Yet I hear that the AVPD community does enjoy getting reassurance.Sometimes it makes me feel like theres a lack of interest but I often end up getting a reply after all just days late . But its confusing to determine wether you are disinterested or just afraid to answer. Love to hear your thoughtsexperiences,Personality-disorder
51777,Nobody in my life has ever truly known me. I put up so many masks around everybody. I show some parts of myself to some people and other parts to other people. And some parts I never show anybody and probably never will. Nobody in my life has ever truly known me they only know the person Ive shown them. Its exhausting but its basically second nature at this point and I literally dont know how to be anything else. I find myself telling so many little lies even about the most mundane things about myself and I dont even mean to do it on purpose. My opinions are always what I think the other person wants to hear. Every word I say and everything I show on the surface is always a watered down version of what I truly want to say and feel. Even when Im just in the car with someone I only play music I think they would like or what I want them to think I listen to. Most of the time I dont even know what parts of myself are true or not. Im like a puzzle made up of completely different pieces that dont fit together. Its all just so fucked. I dont know how to fix this. I wish there was someone who could see through all these masks and help bring out who I actually am but I dont even know if thats possible at this point.,Personality-disorder
51778,I can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life I'm in my 40s now. The last time I had friends was in school. I'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. Actually I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. My friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends i.e. other outsiders. We'd meet to play computer games or sometimes rarely go swimming. But we never really talked about personal stuff. I'm not even sure this counts as friendship?Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together? Am I even capable of friendship?Consequently friendship isn't something I've been looking for. Maybe if I knew what I'm missing out on I would?I'm about to embark on a psychotherapy journey again and I feel unprepared. What do I even want?,Personality-disorder
51779,Anyone else have trouble verbalizing their thoughts and feelings? I used to be quite eloquent when I was younger despite not talking to anyone. I always had the right word or description for what I intended to say. If only I wasnt an asshole and actually practiced conversation.. Not sure where it all started to escape me. Could be when my mental health went downhill or when I got off my meds or when I got high almost every day for a year. But nowadays its not uncommon for me to struggle to write simple sentences. Sending an email or text takes me way longer than it should.It really interferes when Im trying to talk with others. So often I feel like I know what I want to say but the words are just out of reach and instead of adding to the conversation Im just like yeah.. uuuh I feel you,Personality-disorder
51780,I want to curl up into my bed and never leave This week has been absolute hell. I feel so overwhelmed with life right now and I want to be completely alone. I dont want to be perceived or asked why I missed two weeks of class. I dont want people constantly and very publicly asking me if Im okay. Yes Im fine but no Im not fine. Im fine enough to function but I also want to run away. I appreciate the sentiment I just wish it wasnt in front of the whole class.Im pretty sure most of this is my depression talking but its definitely making my AvPD symptoms worse. I feel like EVERYBODY is looking at me. Im beating myself up all the time for what I dontcant do. I feel like everyone hates me. I hate myself. I just want to hide. Curl up into my corner. Never speak to a soul.,Personality-disorder

We have to drive some lesson and i was with a new driving instructor. Finished my lesson and he gave me some tips. One of Them was i dont need to be a mouse at this point i just felt insulted. Why is there always a expectation to be talkative? Yeah im gonna drive people around most elderly but im gonna try as much i can. Im seriously tired of society always expecting everyone to be bubbly and talk constantly.,Personality-disorder
51783,Need to vent. I have had a partner for 4 years. Its a shock to me as well. But we havent had the greatest past. To make a very long story short When he started medical school 4 years ago when we first started dating he wasnt that nice to me. Some might say he was abusive towards me especially when he drank. Anyway he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.Now my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still havent let go of the past. And the truth is neither have I. Ive forgiven my partner but I havent forgotten how everyone else treated me even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school seek any professional or academic opportunities but mainly it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply dont trust anyone anymore. Today my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents and his friends were already there since theyre in the same class. Keep in mind that I havent seen anyone in about 23 years. After panicking for a week before the event I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself its not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot as well. Well.Aside from my partner everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke they wouldnt acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light so he didnt confront anyone. He did stick by my side so I was at least grateful for that. It all just augmented my social anxiety avoidant personality and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me. Im really struggling to decide if its just a bad day or if Im really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that hes grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes ideally we wouldve never had to go through our dark phase. But hes helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me. They have no idea what their rejection does to me.,Personality-disorder
51784,is it only me? i've been diagnosed having BPD borderline personality disorder 4 years ago when i was 16 since then my life have been a living hell. However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot though i still have all the BPD symptoms some symptoms like avoidance social anxiety isolation feeling less came up from nowhere. For matter of fact i stopped talking to all my friends stopped working going out date i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement and if it wasn't for my mother i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden. Sometimes i think i might be paranoid but i don't think people wan't me any harm nor i feel persecuted i'm just ashamed of myself... I don't know if i have AvPD or just social anxiety but it's a fucking misery..Is there anyone if this situation?,Personality-disorder
51785,does anyone else hide their phone from everyone or turn off the television when someone else walks into the room? Not because they are doing something suspicious but because they don't want their preferences or choices to be seen? I have the option to watch YouTube on a smart TV but instead I watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when I'm in company because I don't want anyone to see my web or streaming history even if it's something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article. I just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although it's generally harmless and boring crap.I remember being 10 years old and my brother being angry at me because I would turn off the TV and act all shifty when he walked into the room.When I was a child I would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because I would be so embarrassed. That was my first sign of AVPD.I was eventually diagnosed at 21 and again by another psychologist at 27.,Personality-disorder
51786,Lack of opinion and interest in things Anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? New show comes out new game comes out new trend im always late to it all. I always find myself saying the phrase thats a thing? when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else hasI seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is I hate it and 10 is I love this and will skip sleep to do it the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I love. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times Im just not that into it as the people around me. One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea but like this happens with everything I tryOr when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just heard was a highly paid major without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking what jobs it would train me for hell whether or not I even liked it. It was just ok sounds good. One of the most important decisions of my life made in 10 minutes. And now senior year I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.Makes me think about how many opportunities Ive missed out on simply for being too average and opinionless in life. IdkI'm asking on this sub mostly because I'm curious if this is related to avpd or not. Or if its more a personality thing,Personality-disorder
51787,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know but in the platonic sense too.i don't even think i'm physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera.don't get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age i feel like it's too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people.but i think that's okay. somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food.there's some days when loneliness hurts though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.You think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont. In fact you feel more alone than you did before you left But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. Bojack Horseman,Personality-disorder
51788,This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do could have been done better and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now during my clinical rotations every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve. I am always reserved and quiet and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However this has backfired on me as I struggle to form connections and networks losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible which makes me feel hopeless. What can I do to sustain balance at least in my mind? In addition to this I am lonely and the effect on my alreadydamaged mental health is apparent. Last year I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable and I felt liked. But in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable whether I had anything interesting to say and whether they looked down on me. The gutwrenching anxiety became too much to bear and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media I see how new people have joined the group formed close friendships and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this mysterious aura around me but after a few more dates I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.I'm sorry if I went on for too long or sounded negative but I really needed to share my thoughts and emotions with those who can understand. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.,Personality-disorder
51789,AvPD and covid has ruined my dream job. So I've been a nanny for about 10 years now daycare before that and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction. I'd go to work one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say goodnight and that was it. Since covid however at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to say hi to their kid. I worry so much about where they are what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby my appearance the way I dress. I imagine they're mocking the way I sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.I am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder. I can't tell you how many times I've tossed my phone across the room when I hear footsteps coming because even if I am only looking up the weather or craft ideas I'm terrified they'll think I'm on the phone all day.,Personality-disorder

51791,is it wrong of me? i am not diagnosed with avpd. i think i have it but i wont say i have it. ive shown a lot of symptoms since childhood. im 18 and usually they diagnose people who are older so yea idk. ive posted on here several times and feel such a comfort with all the people who relate. ive lost friendships because of how i am. its so nice to feel understood and to connect with other people like me. i dont know where else to go to vent so i usually go here. all the people who comment really make me feel better since they get it.,Personality-disorder
51792,How do you get through the process of getting a job? Im planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for. I shouldve started applying for those weeks ago but Ive been avoiding it because I feel like Id either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking Ill be a valuable addition to their institution which I dont think I would be. So essentially Ive been doing self sabotage. Now the problem is that Ive had quite a lot of absences at school the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. Ill need references for the application process I dont have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they dont want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they think they know Ill only mess things up. Honestly I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow would be a miracle in the first place Id somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again. If I dont go for this diploma Ill essentially have wasted four years of my life and I dont think my chronically depressed self could recover from that. Any advice?,Personality-disorder
51793,So tired of everything I am so goddamn tired of everything. I am not looking forward to anything have no goals..just a lowpaid job that I don't really like. I guess I can be proud that I got one in the first place despite how horribly painful that was to get used to it and my thoughts about quitting it after first week. But honestly other than that I have no clue why I am doing all this. I mean everything..going to job eating trying to do something..living. I am so tired I barely drag my body to work or practically anywhere. About my job..I got more or less used to it but I still feel like my coworkers hate me. It's my avpd brain acting up again. Goddamn pesky little thing. They're nice to me but this irrational part of me wins every time Every day is a misery and I am so tired..

51794,Just wonder if people have heard of hypersensitivity. Im a Highly Sensitive Person or HSP but I realized I was being super sensitive for awhile now. I think this is when I started to realize my AvPD. I was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it. Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive. I think a lot of this comes from trauma. Also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general. I dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas. Ive been doing that alot more lately. It took a really long time but I feel less stuck now.,Personality-disorder
51795,Please tell me Im not the only one? When people get to know me Im actually very loud. Almost obnoxiously loud as in Id be embarrassed if I acted that way around random people And I sometimes wonder if Im avoidant because of the fact that deep down Im just an obnoxiously loud person and somehow Ive decided being avoidant keeps my life easier. Less drama no risk of annoying people. But then I also wonder if maybe in reality Im just loud sometimes to make up for the way too many times Ive kept everything inside? Idk but that leads me to another question. How can you truly heal from your problems when it would require getting rid of coping mechanisms held in place all your life?I should add Im generally a very quiet person.,Personality-disorder

51798,Anyone here try making online friends? For me its difficult because everyone is more advanced than me or younger. Many people are focused on careersproductivityschoolfamily. I always feel like a kid compared to others when I observe or interact with people.Another issue that would happen is the few people I found remotely on my level would ditch me after some months. I think it does not work with people if you do not objectively help the person or intend to interact with them on a physical or visceral level rather than just talking about interests or random stuff.In theory I should just go ask people if they want to play certain games but it does not feel right if people just opening up about their personal lives or bantering with me makes me feel like trash. It is absurd to me that I have to shut out 99.X percent of the population because they are better than me or I don't share their interests.,Personality-disorder
51799,does anyone else keep making new Reddit accounts? I find myself abandoning Reddit accounts and making new ones every few weeks or so. I hate the fact that Reddit leaves a trail of evidence about me that I can't hide from people and make my comments and questions private. I hate the whole karma and upvotesdownvotes thing. I like Reddit for the simple fact that there are communities here for just about everything that I don't have access to otherwise. I also use Facebook groups but I have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile. If I have commented too much in a single group and people start recognizing me I usually change my name on Facebook. You are usually allowed to change your name on Facebook several times a year or so.I just hate the fact that I am seen and I have built a persona either online or offline. I just wish I could be invisible or anonymous everywhere I went including online. I also hate people knowing what country I was born in because most people are from the United states and it makes me stand out so I try and use American terms and spellings as much as I can. I also have trauma from my home country and just mentioning that I am from there makes me anxious and I feel paranoid talking to people from my own country. I go back and edit comments constantly and I'm always deleting things.People automatically find this behavior shifty and I have been called out a few times and people always think I'm up to something.,Personality-disorder
51800,Is anybody mainly scared of simply being perceived? Like I dont really care if they think Im dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying. Eye contact is the absolute worst because its 100 percent focus. I always try to look people in the eyes but HAVE to look away within a second otherwise I feel like theyll hate me. Im 24M and its waaaay worse with women I feel like Im invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point I dont even know what their face looks like after an interaction.When my best friend of 10 years comes over to watch a movie I will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch. But I can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all. I also feel like I have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if I go to a restaurant I will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time. I just realized being blind would be kinda awesome and probably take away like 90 percent of my stressors. Okay this got way out of hand im baked goodnight and if youre reading this I love you,Personality-disorder
51801,Im worried Im second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me and he asked them not to tell me but they did. When he found out that I knew he cut off all contact with me. Two months later he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it I'd just watch the videos.A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers but whenever I'd watch his videos a few hours later my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days eg. I'd watch his videos one day watch it two days later then the day after and each time I saw them my views went up and on the days that I didn't watch them they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year it was still frequent but less so. Now it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time he even posted a TikTok in English English isn't his first language and all of his previous videos were in his native language.TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.However twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up he started following her on TikTok but unfollowed her within a few hours probably because she didnt follow him back. A month later one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I dont post much and he looks at it every two to three days.,Personality-disorder
51802,You're actually all great people and this subreddit is living proof. I've been on this subreddit for a good period of time now and it's quite an active one with several posts every day and pretty much all of them receive a response of some sort whether it's about people asking for advice or venting. There's no toxicity. There's no arguing. There's just empathy and help. So I just want to say that although living with AvPD can be a painful existence that eats away at our selfesteem I appreciate all of you for making this subreddit such a great space.,Personality-disorder
51803,I make people uncomfortable My presence makes others uncomfortable and i can feel it. There's this awkwardness. Whenever I need to go out and i have to interact with others or when I'm with my own family i feel it. And i know that awkwardness is because of me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I know some will say it's in your head but no i really feel like my presence is just uncomfortable to be around. You know sometimes people can sense things? People can sense when you're sad or in my case uncomfortable in social interactions so they pick up on that and they aren't used to that so then everything becomes uncomfortable. I don't like this feeling.,Personality-disorder
51804,Conversational and social skills what are they I think Ive never given myself a chance to develop them because of AvPD. I couldve had a fuller social life in school but I was so in my shell I just had a few close friends. And even with them I felt I couldve been better. It seemed like they all clicked with each other very well and even though we were all good friends sometimes there was something missing in my connection with people. I know they say skills are to be learned but it really really REALLY seems like its just inborn for other people. So I just do everything I can to avoid one on one conversations so nobody has the chance to think Im weird and dont know how to talk or something.,Personality-disorder
51805,Just a quick moment of levity Hey guys what are your 3 favoritespecial films and 1 tv show you adoreMine areCherryDriveWind River...Mandy is also one of favs especially the first half of the film.And I'm a huge Stranger Things fan that's my favourite tv show,Personality-disorder
51806,I cant sustain long conversations It doesnt matter who the other person is if we are engaged in a conversation the longer it takes the more symptoms I get. At first I am ok then the worry begins in my head where at the same time I am talking I start observing myself. The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear my ears turn red my lips start to shake my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. Later on as days pass I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. After sometime I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. I am 56 and have been like that since High School. Some medications have helped particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes. This is all from times in my childhood where I was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts uncles grandparents and teachers. One of my grandmas used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when I did something bad. So for some reason now when I talk to other adults it triggers all of the reactions I had as a child when I was getting yelled at.,Personality-disorder
51807,Feeling disconnected from peers how do I stand out to fit in? Hi I've been struggling a lot in school from even before college and lonely for most of my life. I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising I can't seem to use social media well too afraid that my relatives will find it andor hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange? I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long I want to express myself and find a space for my art craft and ideas that accepts me for me.And I'm sure in order to be independent I need to also be comfortable with myself.But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down. I feel like a NPC living a scripted life.How do we overcome this and have the courage to live for us? Can I do it in a way to eliminate these stresses? Or is avoiding them the main issue?,Personality-disorder
51808,I love the idea of a romantic relationship but I cant put the work in. I 28M feel like any kind of datingrelationships is just work work work work work work. I like the idea of having a connection in my life but I dont think Im willing to do what it takes.I think bc Im so lowmaintenance I attract a lot of very clingy needy people which made me hate the idea of dating because theyd never leave me alone. And not just the process of dating itself which sucks for most people but just being in a relationship requires too much work and expectations. Maybe Im just lazy but how do you have the motivation to keep going with dating when its just annoyance?,Personality-disorder
51809,crippling guilt from my inability to answer texts I dont know how common this is but its extremely difficult for me to find the strength in me to text people back and its killing my nonexistent social life and the possibility of ever finding love. I live in constant guiltdread knowing that I have people in my DMs trying to contact me to hang out but my fear of embarrassment and awkwardness is freaking killing me. All ive ever wanted was to belong and be able to make friends but my brain literally stops me in my tracks. Its also necessary to note that I have ADHD primarily inattentive and once I take my medication Im lucky to have maybe 30min of adequate dopamine levels to push myself and reply. Sometimes I do reply but when I go back to baseline I just want to isolate and be in my dark room. I really feel like Im being tortured by my own brain. Its a terrible feeling to crave social interaction but to also be deathly afraid of the possibility that I could ruin everything and be viewed as an embarrassment. I really dont feel worthy of having the opportunity to make friends. My SSRIs have made me so numb and my personality rarely sparkles anymore so I cant imagine anyone would want to be around someone so dull.Do any of you relate?? It feels like a mental trap.,Personality-disorder
51810,Currently grieving the life Ill never have Yes Im working on myself and its never to late to startchange. But some things are time sensitive and Ill just have to accept Ill never have children for example. Sure I could pop one out right now but that wouldnt be the responsible thing to do given my mental state as well as just my general state of things.There just isnt enough time for me to get well enough get my life in order find a reasonable partner get married and start a family before time runs out. So now Im just trying to prepare myself for when the inevitable comes and Im still here left alone probably still struggling mentally.That is all Im sad this disorder has robbed me of so much and I still cant seem to get a handle on it.,Personality-disorder
51811,is there a point in trying to completely get over this shit i try so hard to get close to people and basically no ones ever responsive and literally no one gives more than baseline politeness. i expend so much energy trying and nothing comes of it. all i get is hurt because people dont care about me at all. it hurts so much to try and get nothing and rejection in return.I'm genuinely wondering if there's really any point in me continuing to try when nothing works out and i just end up in so much pain. i want to just give up and isolate to save energy and prevent this fucking god awful pain i keep feeling over and over again every time something social comes upi understand part of this hopeless feeling is my unrelenting depression but ive quite literally never been able to develop true close relationships outside fucking elementary school and im 21 now,Personality-disorder
51812,just turned to my coworker and talked one day i've always been in awe of people who can just start talking. every time i think 'i could say this!' it's immediately dogpiled with other thoughts. the self hating ones. i don't have it in me to list them right now but if you're reading this unfortunately you probably know what i mean. anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday and i got my marlboros out of my locker. smoking is bad i know. i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy. so i turned to my coworker notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew and said hey check these out. and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries but not here USA. i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since especially not while 100 sober. it was nothing. and the self hating thoughts came right after. but once those settled a bit it was nice. thanks so much for reading i just wanted to ramble as always.,Personality-disorder

51814,Can denying my sexuality be a cause of AVPD? So few years back i got AVPD diagnosis. I am now trying to get out of this rut and fix things. Thing is i have avoided everything all my life even my feelings. So its hard.One thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at 13 years old i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality. I only came out once i was 19. So 6 years i was 'locked' in avoiding being who i am. I am in my 30s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out.Is it possible that being ' in the closet' for more then 6 years contribute in developing AVPD? As i notice i still dont accept my sexuality 100 and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality. Thats what i did when i first figured out i was gay thinking that my then friends would bully or reject me...Any other gay people here who can relate?,Personality-disorder
51815,I just need to vent about my partner. I think my partner has bpd maybe AvPDHi everyone. I have no idea how to start this. Im honestly not even sure if bpd or AvPD is correct Im just grasping at straws at this point. My 27f boyfriend 28ms brother has been diagnosed with bpd. Which is why this is my first step. And while Im obviously not looking for someone to diagnose him like this Im just lost. And need someone to listen. I am massively struggling in my relationship and I just need someone to listen. Even if this goes nowhere. My boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if I were to ask the same in return. We just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and I cant quite think of an example of that at the moment he does ask for things in one moment and when I do them or stick to it he tells me its wrong. Example he has wanted to get a photo ID for a while. We have two options drivers licence or a photo card. About a month or probably two ago he said he needed photo ID for a test at work hed been putting off. Then he said not long ago that we dont motivate each other to do the things we need to. I know he has anxiety planning things and doesnt want to so for our anniversary I said pick which ID you want Ill drive you there pay for it and itll be done. Ill put all the planning into it. All good and he loved that idea. The day we were supposed to go he was angry about something and it caused an argument. So we didnt go. Which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. To today. Each week he said Ill do it next week on my day off so I asked and he pushed it again. Today we spoke about it and while hes not good at planning I was waiting around to find out if we were going or not as I wanted to plan when I was done work and went to get gas and groceries. When it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test I told him that I didnt care if we went but if he wanted to study more now was the time. He told me tonight that he only did it so ID shut up about it and when I said you told me you wanted more motivation so I gave it to you he just said fair. But we always have those moments where he says he wants something and I change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. If I try and talk to him about my needs or what Im wanting more of or how Im hurt by something he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. Or hell just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what I was even talking about. If we have an argument for 1 full hour lets say. There will be lulls in the argument. Maybe every 15 minutes. Maybe start half hour mark and then end. It always changes but the lull is when he sits listens and answers me with respect. The other times its that I have said even one word to set him off and hes miserable. And angry and not nice. Im finding myself constantly working around his moods. Sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a TikTok or something I find interesting. If he agrees with what Im showing him all is good. If he doesnt he gets angry. Says hes confused and basically shuts down. Tells me he thinks thats dumb or why would someone even do that. Theyre not part of my life. Why do I even need to listen to that. If Im talking about my work or just complaining hell tell me why he doesnt want to hear it. That its not part of his world so it doesnt matter. Ive asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever I do hell tell me something he needs in return. He cant just take blame for things. Sometimes he can. But normally cant. I definitely do not help the situation because I am at his every beck and call and hes at none of mine. If he asks to be left alone and I walk to another room he says he feels guilty that Im going away. And that hell just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesnt get his way anyway. He wants to be left alone a lot. Cant ever take anything I say and listen. Always has to tell me why whatever Im going through is something hed love to have or how his life is worse. Example we moved for his work. Away from my family and friends and my best friend dropped me. While she was being shitty all the time she was the last person I had to talk to. And if Im sad about it he tells me thats his dream for people to leave him alone and he doesnt understand why Im upset. If something small happens he wildly blows it out of proportion. Especially if its something he doesnt understand. I have to be careful with how I joke with him because he will take everything to heart but has zero problem disrespecting me or poking fun at me for something. If we go out at all he doesnt want to be there and will usually get extremely high or drunk to avoid socializing because it makes him anxious. Im just not sure if this is like anything anyone has dealt with and Im looking for advice or help or just something. Thank you for reading this long novel. I really appreciate you all.,Personality-disorder
51816,I dont know if I actually have AvPD Last few months I was struggeling with lots of depression. So I started looking on internet and I found lots of mental illnesses and I really felt like this one is really matching my symptoms.Now when I somehow improved my depression I see myself differently and I feel differently. I had depression my whole life without even realizing it for me having depression was a normal state sme I had no idea that there is a nondepression state.But now when my depression improved I see that some of AvPD symptoms starting disappearing and I feel better.But at this point I am just not sure I might have it and depression was making it worse. And I might now have it and it was just depression all the time.,Personality-disorder
51817,Mentally Exhausted I have been very mentally exhausted.I dont mind working long hours at my job its just at my job theres a lot of people around since its a large store connected to a bunch of departments. A few months since I graduated high school Ive been working. But I cant seem to really talk to people. I have a tendency to avoid the groups sometimes I cant even open my mouth. Its even worse when I think about how much I suck and how awful I look. I feel like an inconvenience and a burden because plainly I am pretty stupid. Even though at the beginning of my job I was putting on a smile and a happy voice to convince myself it was okay I cant even get myself to smile or look people in the eyes unless I have to. I am so exhausted. I dont know whats wrong with me. I am depressed both mentally and physically tired. I really have no plans for my future.,Personality-disorder
51818,Feeling like I don't do enough I'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not if it's imposter syndrome if it's from old Christian mantras of put others before yourself being baked into my psyche since childhood or if it's a combination of all three but I often feel like I don't do enough for other people in my life. Whether it's with other family members close friends or coworkers I often get this sense. I work from home. And I've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. But now that we're sitting near the finish line almost ready to golive with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover I can't help but feel some kind of guilt like I'm not doing enough. Even though I helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. With friends or family it often comes in the form of should I be there? or I know I be there be present but I really don't want to and then I just feel like a POS terrible friendsiblingsonetc. for not doing it. For example a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. Naturally I didn't go. I'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. Nonetheless I still felt like an asshole for skipping. Especially later when I talked to my dad and asked how it went I asked who was there? and he said Just about everyone. Except for you. I don't think he intended to make me feel guilty but it kind of did. My mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it but nonetheless I felt like I didn't do enough. Even though again this relative having the child and I don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. Another example is a friend a close friend who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. They'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants and 9 times out of 10 I don't go. Part of me appreciates the hell out of that because I need it and it's nice to be includedwanted. Another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone because I don't think I'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. Then I start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. Wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder or if it's something else. Anyone else experience this?,Personality-disorder

51820,Devastated after finding out my little sister has a secret boyfriend Not sure if this belongs here but I'm so upset about this that I haven't slept all night. My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts interests and even my mental health struggles. I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything. Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities. I knew this day would come my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone abandoned and betrayed. She never mentioned that guy to me and my father I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything. Of course I want her to be happy but now all I'm left to do is wait for her to get married move to a different country and forget about me leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone.,Personality-disorder

51822,Did not even want to say hi to me I have an online friend and they really wanted me to meet their friend. I was hesitant but they told me that theyre nice so I joined their little discord server literally had like 5 people total with me with the intentions of maybe sending a message or two and never again. But their friend didnt even want to say hi to me. Like my friend told him to say hi and he literally just said no . This happened a few days ago and Im like really upset about it. He barely even knows anything about me.I talked to my friend today and they said that they think he is just jealous that im sort of close with them. But Im still really really hurt and upset about.

51827,HopelessnessToo lateness Is there a point where one can consider it too late to do anything? Too late to try too late to get treatment too late for anything and everything? Too old? Or if someone is too badly off? I've seen some people around Reddit and the net refer to failed lives. I've recently made posts and tried to look around Reddit for people in a similar situation as mine and there seems to be nobody. And the only conclusion I can draw is that my circumstances are too uniquely screwed up. And AvPD along with other issues all intersecting have led to a completely failed life and me as a broken mess. Growing up or developing AvPD in a family full of NPD didn't help.Most subs seem to skew younger which has me think that everybody either resolved their issues as they grew up or are no longer alive. How has anybody dealt with utter despair and hopelessness? Feeling too old and that it's too late to change anything satisfactorily? Does anyone have other issuesdiagnoses that mix with AvPD to just make things impossible?,Personality-disorder
51828,Quality over quantity Friendships I know people with AvPD struggle to maintain friendships and I do too. For me I think it's the daily or at least frequent messaging to stay in touch that I struggle with. I will get tired and ignore messages just because I don't have the capacity to engage with a subject that I frankly probably don't care much about or I'm just worn out by the constant interaction. The messaging for the sake of messaging gets to me. if it's a friend that lived far away then I'd rather not speak for 6 months and then just meet up and have a good time before reverting back to usual which for me is far less exhausting and fortunately I do have a couple that are like that. Anyone relate?,Personality-disorder
51830,Longtime lurker with AvPD just wanting to vent about the fantasy of disappearing and starting a different life Using my alt throwaway because reasons. Recently Ive been having a hard time and although I have deeply caring and wonderful people in my life I still isolate and as much as I crave time with others I get tired so easily after a short while. Also grew up with cluster B parents and family which doomed me to some kind of mental problems. Lately Ive begun to think about the idea of just leaving. Disappearing no trace. Not suicide. Im not suicidal at all I mean leaving going somewhere Im not known changing all my details and completely starting over. I cant help but feel it would make no difference to anyone in fact it might even be better.Ive googled step by step how tos on it.Im hoping to be able to talk to others who have been in this dark of a place and what got you through or any advice.Because this is mostly just a fantasy but the idea is sticking in my head more than Id like it to. I dont actually want to go through with it. I think Edit for clarity what got you through the mental state if youve felt this way not advice on disappearing. Oops!,Personality-disorder

51832,I came off as an asshole today and Im struggling with it I went to the mall to buy some fragrances and I came off as a massive asshole to the cashiers. There was originally only one girl that was attending the area I went to so I thought I would be fine. Wrong. She seemed like she was new and when I asked her for the fragrance I wanted she seemed confused and said she was going to get someone to help me. She came back with two women and theyre all staring at me while I say what I want. Then one of the women she brought back started asking me questions I wasnt prepared for this and I sort of shut down. She asked me what I was currently wearing and I lied and said I didnt wear anything currently then she asked me if I would wear something sweeter than the fragrance I had picked out and I just shook my head and looked at some other bottles of perfume. I acted mostly dismissive towards the three women because I was so uncomfortable and just wanted the situation to end. I wanted to get out of the situation as fast as possible so I grabbed a different fragrance that I was familiar with and told them I would just buy that. I had tried to prepare myself beforehand to speak to one person because the last time I went there was only one person I had to talk to. Talking to three people made me so uncomfortable and I acted like a dismissive asshole. I thought it would be really easy for me since I already knew what I wanted and I assumed I could just tell the lady the name of what I wanted and she would tell me whether they had it or not. I also feel really bad for the new girl because I could tell she didnt really know what she was doing and I just made it worse for her. And the lady that was asking me questions seemed very nice and I feel bad for acting the way I did. Now that I think about it the second lady was probably trying to set an example to the new girl and I ruined it for her. I had avoided buying fragrances online in fear that the bottles would break in the mail but I will probably only buy them online from now on.This experience made me realize that I also act cold and assholeish to everyone thats not the people I live with or my mom. But thats also the only way I can speak to people so Im kind of stuck between dont socialize at all or act cold to everyone.,Personality-disorder
51833,what avoidance feels like to me i'm not diagnosed but i always thought there was something deeply wrong with me. i've never kept a friend longer than a couple years. i'm in my second year of college and i have been at zero since covid happened. i've transferred schools so new place and new people and i'm more isolated than before.it feels like i'm not human because i'm unable to do the human thing and communicate. like i'm watching and observing but as an alien or a void or something that looks human but if you look to closely its all distorted. or robotic even. someone's failed attempt at a human being.all i do is lay in bed and ruminate over every bad interaction with past friends and family or think about how my roommates or classmates perceive me. fake conversations justifying my actions to absolutely no one. it feels like i'm going insane. i thought it was just social anxiety but i don't get panic attacks. and my reluctance and inability feels wired directly into my veins every fiber of my being and it feels like it can't be undone. like my entire identity is wrapped up in being alone. and that's all i'll ever be.,Personality-disorder
51834,as to not be a burden i will now isolate myself. you are welcome! recently I've been distancing from my friend because I needed some space. but after a while I noticed they seem... happier without me. like actually laughing and smiling more they even started talking to a very cool person. and they even talk to other ppl in the group more often. so now I'm kinda isolating myself because well... i just want them to be happy. if being absent from their life is what will make them happier ill do that. seems like I'm just a toxic person that drains everyone around them.,Personality-disorder

51837,How to cope with shame Hello I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame shame of what I did in a specific moment shame of how I reacted what I've said shame on how I was dressed the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things because anything material has more value than me . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things. ampx200BHow do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life? When I remember one time I start remembering the others they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence that they already happened that there is no way I could live with those things that happened. I feel shame from myself all the time but when those memories come to me I want to snap out of existence. I don't know how to deal with that. Thank you.,Personality-disorder
51838,its becoming impossible to keep avoiding my life without real consequences well real consequences already happened and i avoided facing the feelings that wouldve prevented them from happening but now my parents are threatening putting me in a halfway home or making me live with them again them saying they would sell the house which utterly terrifies me but in the face of how my life has gone suicide is also a considerable option tho not one i can follow through on but its becoming easier to every day its amazing how the economy and life can utterly ruin people isnt it why is it so hard for me to speak in my own voice oh right the trauma its really hard to drag them out of it as their minds resemble mine far too much and mine resembles theirs far too much the pain of having to get a job while also not even being able to be myself in real life is really depressing i feel like just another person with unfulfilled dreams forced to grow up and accept reality,Personality-disorder
51839,Is there anyone else here who checks off all of the boxes for AvPD but cant ever get officially diagnosed with it because your case just isnt bad enough? Im fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that Ive been able to match up to down to a tee. Ive went to therapy and discussed my issues but it doesnt seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.While Im fairly certain I have avpd my case is more mild because it doesnt completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young Ive always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didnt have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that Ive been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. Its a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I cant get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?,Personality-disorder
51840,AvPD can be avoiding woman only? I wonder if avoiding woman can be AvPD? I have avoided woman almost my whole life at some point in high school I liked a girl I talked to a bit. But never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way. Its probably the only time I spoke with a girl. Mainly because I was invested in wanting to be with he but was to afraid to be with her in a relationship.If AvPD is not only avoiding woman for my instance then I dont understand AvPD.,Personality-disorder
51841,I haven't been diagnosed yet I haven't been diagnosed with AvPD but I think I may have this disorder. I was always an anxious child then in my teens I started taking panic attacks before any social situation but mainly before going to school so I stopped going to school I just avoided it. I'm now nearly 30 and I've never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance. I feel like I now avoid anything that causes me the tiniest bit of stress by not leaving my house sleeping and not letting anyone know about it. I then get really depressed and disappointed in my self. It just feels like an endless cycle of me not showing and getting down about. I'm just wondering how AvPD affects others and if there is anyone from the UK suffering from AvPD Thanks,Personality-disorder
51842,How to deal with rejection when you have avpd? I feel like I'm dying like there's a hole in my chest and thoughts make me feel like I'm falling in. I'm also having very negative thoughts I'm realising I'm angry at myself for being vulnerable enough for this to happen to me. Please help if you've been through this...I see no hope. P.s I mean rejected after asking a girl out I've been talking to for months.,Personality-disorder
51843,I despise my mom 22m Pretty much the title I just can't stand her I never liked her ever since I was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it.Just to clarify I don't think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if it's just the order of the way I put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are MY things she isn't satisfied with the way I put my clothes in my wardrobe or when I don't do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy In the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open even this days she complain when I don't leave a gap but on that case I don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kidspeople' because I don't act or do things they do and I cant forget her 'what you gonna do with your life play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason.Im afraid of embarrassing myself in public im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because I don't think I can do it or I'll make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how I was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons I eat in my room is because I just don't want to be around her because I will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it and my dad lives abroad my ears my hair my clothes everything. She always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever I want regardless of her opinionpicks I still remember that when I was younger she would be upset and mad if I didn't wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as I said I still wear what I wear and the judgement doesn't stop at that. Her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about the way I behave WhY YoU ARe NoT SmiLing and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. She would always try to buy me stuff I don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something.When I think about all of this and other stuff I understand why im so incompetent afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. It's not all her there are things I probably could've done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now I need to find a way to get back on track somehow.Also today I pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings I stored inside. I don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling.P.S if there was another post made by me that's titled the same blame my stupid phone for this XD. Im also sorry for possible grammar mistakes don't mind someone fixin them.,Personality-disorder

51845,Why do I want to be famous?Someone dm me pls Why do I want to be famous?Someone dm me plsThis is a throwaway account. People on social media always say Im trying to get attention but wtf is wrong with that? I dont know for sure if I have avpd but I think I do I cant pay for therapy I live with my mom and I hate her Im 18 cant drive alone I always get in crashes or get a ticket sometimes I speed because Im mad at my uncle. I have a job but I dropped out of school because I dont care and I have so much trauma from everything in my childhood. And anyway nothing matters now except being famous thats all I want I just have no idea why in real life I avoid people but online I have a girlfriend and Im obsessed with her it scares me sometimes because I cant stop thinking about her and if she broke up with me I dont think I could take it Ive only met her once in real life but it doesnt matter I talk to her all the time but the most important thing is that she talks to me and shes obsessed with me so I need her. I think I deserve to be famous more than anyone else because Ive been through so much and also I feel like Im better than most people something about me is different and Im special . Can someone dm me to talk more about this? I need to know why I want to be famous and how can I get famous? Also is it possible to have avpd and want to be famous?,Personality-disorder
51846,Societal Standards Not sure if this is just me but the more I self reflect the more i realize that im unhealthily antisocial but ok with that until i feel societal pressure to be different. Ive always been a loner and i can be like that ALL the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who arent like that and find it weird. Its almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because thats what you need for a happy life apparently but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure theres literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess Im deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and cant relate to others and feel insecure about it like I wish I could be in the standard of whats normal but Im also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy its hard to put into words how I feel but its like Im so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people dont live their lives like that. I dont want to miss out but find it hard to change. I guess my behavior isnt normal but trying to fit in just makes my anxiety so bad. Hopefully somebody understands what I mean. I think this is just how it is when your mentality ill for a long period of time.,Personality-disorder

51848,Conversations Anybody else feel like they dont have the natural ability to have good conversations?Whenever Im having a conversation with strangers Im often pretty quiet and I dont know what to say unless its work related or something Im really familiar with. I think this is normal with society anxiety thoughBut whenever I have conversations with a group of people Im comfortable with like my family I feel like I suck at having conversations. If its about a topic I dont care about I always zone out or stare at out the window. If its about a topic Im interested in its so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn I can wait but it stresses me out and its hard to jump in sometimes. It feels like Im going to forget what I was going to say or theyll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk I feel like people dont really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations sometimes its just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background. Anybody relate,Personality-disorder

51851,How to not hurt peoples feelings I think Im doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally dont interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I cant always have a recovery. When Im socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof disinterested monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them Im just worn out.Usually with strangers it doesnt matter that much because Ill never meet them again but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc. and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying but Im just really irritated right now for reasons other than you and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and theres no reason you wouldve known this Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I cant manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because I at least want to preserve their feelings. My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me do you hate me am I annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent its a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about. I cant handle navigating those questions when Im socially overstimulated but I dont want to make her insecure worse either. I know a relationship is a two way street but I always feel like a burden for my emotions and needs Any advice?,Personality-disorder
51852,Do you have goals? I realised that I never really had or was aware of life goals or dreams I had. I think this is why I don't really feel like a person and so different from others. And why I never let anyone get close to me otherwise they would realise how different I am and distance themselves.Do you have dreams and goals? Have you ever had them maybe as kids?,Personality-disorder
51853,I feel like Ive missed out on my teenage years Its so depressing to think people have spent all these years going out with their friends and partying whilst I was just on my own in my room. Ive always had barely any friends and never been in a relationship or had a paid job I only managed to start doing a few hours a week voluntary work a few months ago. I watch the people around me do exciting things and make new friends and get partners whilst Im just here bored alone and depressed as usual. It doesnt help that later this year Ill move away from this town for university and Ill probably never see most of the people Ive spent years wanting to be friends or more with but been too scared to talk to again. It feels like this phase of my life is really slipping through my fingers and I have no time to repair it. I try to tell myself at least I have the future where I could become better and make the next phases of my life better than this one but in reality I know that Ive just been declining for years so I doubt that very much.,Personality-disorder
51854,did a bunch of dxm yesterday and I realized that the reason I'm like this is that I've viewed other people as threats my whole life. Ever since I was little I've implicitly assumed that other people want to hurt me until and unless I have incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. I have no idea why I'm like this. It sounds like something someone who was abused would write but I wasn't. My parents were nice and caring. I just came out wrong somehow lmao. I had nothing to be afraid of and yet I was terrified of everything ,Personality-disorder
