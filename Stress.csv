27350,October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and I am a domestic violence survivor who is still struggling even after over four years. Lately I have been feeling very angry. Angry that my abusive ex received no real consequences for his actions.

Mostly I just like having control over myself and my surroundings so the idea of being in a metal tube 30000 feet in the air is not ideal for me.

I've tried asking her about it and genuinely understanding why she feels this way about it but she can't seem to describe it rationally saying that it's a gut feeling that she gets that legitimately bothers her and gives her anxiety. She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she can't help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her.

I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help which they did before my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha! yet seem more at ease with other people.,Stress

During the school year we exchanged letters every day at school that in retrospect sounded a lot like love letters from her part but I chalked it up to a best friend love. I'd never been in a romantic relationship- I was 13 at that point and didn't really know what that looked like anyway.,Stress
27429,I got 6 stitches. My parents love my bf and in fact my mom and him are so close that they go on walks and go to the movies together. I felt uncomfortable and unwanted by his family.

When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things.

27436,I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life. Im worried about losing my job my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny with a better job that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life even everyday interactions going to the store these can be extremely stressful events. You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.,Stress
27438,"(Hurt the ego but whatever I guess you're not always gonna be the hottest guy she's ever been with.) Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me - an e-mail to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"" not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.",Stress
27439,There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy. Hi I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate. Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck. I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues but mostly health anxiety. My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.,Stress

But when my parents also failed to realise that my sister was on meth and neglecting her children who are very dear to me it sort of doubled the trauma and now I have full blown trauma. I feel like my parents just aren't trustworthy. How can they live in such an oblivious bubble? I wouldn't put any faith in them to protect me now and feel that I'm in this world on my own.,Stress
27471,I don't even know that I feel lonely. I was fine with all this until my boyfriend asked out of concern because he thought maybe I was depressed or something and pushing everyone away. Then it was like he knocked down a wall inside me that I didn't know was there and revealed a whole room full of cobwebs. I feel ashamed and defective and hopeless now. But I don't know what to do.,Stress
27473,I'm a senior and I'm starting to go through the college application process and I just feel so overwhelmed. I haven't even finished my college list started ny essays or supplemental or filed my FAFSA. Not to mention I'm doing EA so I have a sooner deadline. I haven't visited any colleges and me ecs are so bad. God I just want this to be over with.,Stress
27475,I am so confused! Why is he playing these games? I have made it clear I want him back and to me it’s like he has feelings but is unwilling to say anything? TL;DR I’ve been dating a guy for a few months we split up over a silly petty argument since we’ve split up he’s been maintaining that he wanted us to break up but he’s checking in on me and asking what I’m doing. Is he just being controlling or does he have feelings still?,Stress

Like for one example *""...that time I called you from jail and you cried b/c you were at a guys house and you knew what you did was wrong so you told me you needed help...""* yet he won't show me any evidence (it doesn't exist)... He's literally fabricating things out of thin air and claiming they happened. He isn't denying that he was an abuser but he's saying like ""You were bad too!",Stress
27483,I'm just scared to death. I have anxiety problems which are probably contributing to it. But he keeps telling me he'd never judge me for anything and my sister said if he's OK with a missing tooth he should be OK with a gap. I'm worried he'll see me and change his mind about me and I don't know what to do. Should I tell him about it first or just see what happens?,Stress
27484,This has made me really question where I am and if I should be staying put. Sort of if where I was was right I wouldn't be feeling like this is now. I'm not thinking I should leave for the sake of being single to see someone else but maybe if I'm not as happy as I thought I should be leaving for me to have some time and space to do things on my own.

27485,I have had the worst anxiety of my life recently. As a college student I am now falling behind in classes forgetting about sorority events and not interacting with my friends. I am slowly losing my mind. My room is a mess and the only thing keeping me out of a mental hospital right now is literally my students where I student teach. I am exhausted of fighting to get out of bed everyday shaking when I sit in class and just not talking to anyone.,Stress
27486,If I hadn’t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both. I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names. I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear. But at least he didn’t hit me. I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didn’t need to hear my voice.,Stress

27490,Hi everyone I have GAD that gets much stronger/prevalent when I don't have enough sleep. Coincidentally it also makes me unable to sleep sometimes so kinda like a vicious circle. Normally I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears. My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.,Stress
27492,I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse. My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa. Now what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it. But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane. I tried talking to my family about it but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.,Stress
27493,My current boyfriend wasn't right just a figure of the coma induced illusion. The only voice that seemed remotely really was my best friend she's one of the few regular poodle I still have contact from that time.

My ex who abused me for 11 years might be waiting tight there for me again.,Stress
27497,I know I should tell her my doubts because I know she's gone through doubts before as well. But I also don't know if now I'm just second guessing because I'm just generally concerned about the future.

27500,I wonder what I would be like if I had gotten help earlier on. **Here's where I could use some input: I don't consider myself mentally ill. I hate the word.

27502,He has been my best friend since the first day we met he treats me great he is always loving not at all selfish etc. We rarely fight and have only had maybe 2 other big arguments which we worked out. I am just so hurt over what he said to me. Do I just let it go and move forward with his apology? Like I said it’s not like either of us ever drink and the only reason we made it a point to drink so much was because I spent so much on the alcohol package for vacation.,Stress
27503,I would like to leave there but I'm terrified of a shelter. I'm also a semi observant Jewish woman. Most shelters won't help me keep kosher and keep Shabbat both of which are important to me.

27506,It’s only happened 3/4 times recently but I’ve been putting off having sex and I’m constantly worried that my girlfriend doesn’t think I’m into her or that I’m losing interest and so on. I’ve only just mentioned to her that I might be struggling with some form of anxiety. It’s a vicious circle at the moment. It’s almost as if I can’t relax and if I have nothing to worry about I create something to worry about. What do you guys think?,Stress
27508,One of the couples has a four-year-old daughter. We live in a two bedroom apartment. I constantly have to do shit for these people. One of the wives scolds me constantly and tells me I need to show more respect for my parents.

27509,I hate the thought that even after my mom's death she still has power over me. Anyways I've come here for advice on meds specifically if this sounds like a good place to start.

Since then it keeps happening like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear. I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.,Stress

I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse. We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months.

Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality i am doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars or it is sitting its dark throne rubbing its pitchfork planning its next move on how to fuck me both literally and figuratively.,Stress
27560,It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection. He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled pinned and tickled on a routine basis. I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy that I was overreacting.,Stress
27562,When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped.

27602,The silent sadness that you feel for no apparent reason yet somehow you feel too weak or too much of a pussy to do anything about it or even think that you deserve better because you feel like you deserve whatever painful feeling you are going through You feel like you rather suffer a long and painful life rather than ending your life because you feel like you deserve whatever agony you are going through The anxiety and panic attack come and go whenever they please. __________________________________________________________ Sometimes it feels like you somehow been hit by an invisible truck and your body is as frozen as it somebody turned you into a popsicle and you have no other choice but shake from the inside.,Stress
27604,As I recover I am in a great deal of conflict. I am scared to remember that year. I am frightened of what might be there. And I feel guilty for not remembering that year too. I go way down the rabbithole sometimes wondering if I am crazy and nothing happened and my ex was right because there are so many things I can't remember now.,Stress
27607, She resents my relationship with our son - My son is a Daddy's boy. Even now as I type this I hear him out there waiting for me saying Daddy Daddy Daddy. He comes and gives me hugs when I come home and barely notices when my wife is gone or comes home. - ‎This is also something she's recently admitted and I feel guilty about it but I feel like it's because she puts in no effort beyond what she needs to do.,Stress
27610,I'm so used to being forced to submit to him that I no longer have a voice. He heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat. An example would be at Darvin furniture one time. He takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk. I look at a $100 discount desk and he says we don't have enough money.,Stress
27613,I can't stop the ruminating thoughts about the whole process. I also can't stop the what if's or I should have done more. I keep blaming myself and beating myself up. It sometimes makes me physically sick. Do you have any tips to help alleviate the pain and stop the thoughts?,Stress
27616,Both of these were poor choices. It just exacerbated the situation. I had vases game controllers tv remote coffee mugs etc thrown at me on varied encounters. This is not an exaggerated list.. I tried to leave and she blocked the door with her body threatening to kill herself on one such occassion.,Stress
27617,"They are very sweet and welcoming to me but I feel so overwhelmed with everything. I feel as though I gave up my independence to come here which is fine but I'm having a really hard time adjusting to everything being handed to me when I've had to provide for myself for so long. I told my boyfriend that I need supplies for the week and he responded with ""ask my mom"". I couldn't wrap my mind around that. I still cant.",Stress
27622,Most of 2017 I stayed at around 135 and have been really good about hiding my fat with very flattering clothes but over the last 3 months I have gained 15lbs as a result of traveling for work moving to a new city and the holidays. I have always been very unhappy with the way I look and I envy girls who are slim. I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic he loves me to death he tells me how beautiful I am every day he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.,Stress
27623,He admitted to using the social media of girls he knows to get off. He even admitted to using his ex's nudes to get off. He downloads that specific app and then usually deletes it. He forgot today. We have sex 1-3 times a day.,Stress
27624,In his own ways I know he loves me but he's double my body weight he's a weight lifter and he has blind rage that only comes out on me of all people . If I keep gambling he could permanently damage me. I'm in healthcare I know these numbers so WHY? I like to believe that he knows his limits when we're fighting but he has scared me and himself in the past. Now that chokings are happening during every incident the accidents could be irreversible.,Stress
27626,"Anyway I feel like maybe I should talk to someone but I have no idea how to even bring it up with my doctor. How does that work? Do I just march in and say ""Hey Dr I think maybe I have PTSD.""? Just sounds weird. EDIT: Also want to throw in here that I'm not interested in being medicated",Stress
27628,She humiliates me in front of other people and when we're alone. I'm always just a servant who's there to get her drinks and hype her up. I'm always just the butt of her jokes. She used to invite me over when she was hanging out with a guy she was trying to hook up with just so she could make fun of me in front of him the whole time to make herself look better and/or cooler. I'm just a prop.,Stress
27630,We were hoping to call when he leaves for work today-he’s leaving in about 15 minutes. I’m really scared and I think he’ll continue to come after us even after he goes to jail so we’re probably going to have to get a restraining order. Considering we’re a financially unstable family this is going to majorly impact the way we live. We live in a two bedroom apartment so we’re probably going to have to move to a studio or anything else that’s cheaper. My brother leaves in 2 days because he has to go back to college and we need to take action when he’s here because me and my mom can’t really go against my dad (physically).,Stress
27631,"We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower. And he said he ""hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible"" but said that he ""accepts that this is the way I am"" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide smiled at him and small talked. We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day. This made him even more mad.",Stress
27637,My girlfriend does have PTSD. She said that she thought that I might have it because of an incident that occurred in 2014. You can read about it in my post history but basically I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for pretty much no reason the therapists responsible for it just covered themselves up and lied about it. It greatly affected me. I would definitely consider it to be a traumatic event not just because of the actual events that transpired and the conditions of the hospital (which are pretty bad) but also just the huge betrayal of trust.,Stress
27638,"I have never before felt so betrayed by the system. Fiance (f) was blackout drunk. She started getting physical by grabbing my genitals and pulling so hard I now have a 1.5"" tear in my scrotum.. after that I was punched bitten scratched and kicked over the next 5 minutes. All I could do was try to retreat but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time). As I got scared she would seriously hurt me or I would strike her back I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.",Stress
27640,I even pressed chargers against him. Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it. Nothing has happened since June and I’m about to be moving far away from him. I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still. I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.,Stress
27642,I have been reluctant to start one of these as I am really ashamed to ask for help. One of my dear friends suggested I do this as I really do not have anywhere else to ask for assistance right now. I am at a high risk for homelessness. Landlord now wants me out unless I can come up with $800 in the next couple of days. I also was recently kicked off of food stamps lately for no apparent reason and I am working to get that fixed.,Stress
27643,As much of an asshole I know it makes me I simply can't put my heart into a relationship in which I know I'm not the father of her child. I was ghosted this past summer by one of few people I've ever wanted to have a relationship with and the subsequent weeks were a quest to find sex that would distract me from the pain. Others came before but she's the first to actually show interest in the long term. She's made these ambitious plans for our distant future and I don't have it in my heart to tell her it'll never happen. She's the first girl to show me daily how much she cares for me and the impending thought of breaking her heart is killing me.,Stress
27645,so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed crying daily not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day some days 3 some days 1 or even 0 and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life doing well in school seeing friends again working going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away crying not eating and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).,Stress
27647,I'm taking care of her but I have no idea what to do with myself. **TL;DR: My wife told her co-worker that she and I were in an open relationship and started hooking up with him. She said it's because I have too high a libido because our relationship lost it's newness and because I don't do a fair share of housework. I'm not sure if we can work it out or if I should just leave. **,Stress
27649,I can't take a shower and I haven't eaten today. I am sitting in my car and almost on empty. I keep ending up with abusive men who pretend to love me and my kids then hurt us. I am on a waiting list for housing but no call backs yet. The kids are safe and good and I go see them every few days til I have a place.,Stress
27653,Does anyone have any advice? I feel pretty hopeless right now. I want desperately to be with my partner and I suspect even if our relationship ends I will always love and care for him very much. I don't want to spend my life wishing I was with him but be too overcome with my anxiety and fear to do so. It is discouraging to feel as though my ex-boyfriend is still inside my head and controlling my life.,Stress
27657,My main thing lately is that everything is making me feel overwhelmed and stressed out even in non-stressful situations just every day life. I have a good life that is a lot less stressful than most but it seems to cause me a lot more stress than it would to anyone else like my wife for example. I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all. I've been checked out many times full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned. I've always had an idea in my head that I would do anything and everything to avoid taking medications and I've been convinced that I can deal with this on my own and if I can't then I'm doing something wrong.,Stress
27658,"I've told her each time to stop she apologised but doesn't see what the big deal is because she ""hasn't been in love with me for a long time."" This is when I started to feel awful. I can't fully figure out why though because Im not in love with her - I probably hate her and haven't realised it yet. I just feel terrible. I can barely get out of bed to go to uni.",Stress
27663,I’ve had a some fucked shit happen to me. I'm not going into detail because I'm not looking for sympathy. Today is the last day I have to pay or quit. I don’t have anyone to help and I’ve exhausted all my other options applying for loans pawning things etc. I need to somehow come up with 1490.46 by 6 pm.,Stress
27667,So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage. At this point my nurse self kicks in I can't not help someone in that situation. I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone. But I also want to hate him and leave. So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?,Stress
27669,! I feel like I am in a pit that I cannot escape from. I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow everytime I do I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it! ! EDIT 2 ..,Stress
27670,So a bit of long back story here I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point. My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad sincemy mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.,Stress
27673,He seemed satisfied with this and kept pouring me drinks. Eventually he decided to close up for the night and I went back up to the house tipsy and confused about what had just happened but glad I had bargained some time. I got myself on the dole and the rope that was against my neck seemed to loosen just a little bit. However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies. Although I had some more regular income I would often binge on the euphoria of having money (I was still a teenager after all) spend too much in my mania and then quickly sink into paranoia and avoidance when rent day came along.,Stress
27676,He suddenly wanted to have a relationship with her which I saw as a good thing. I said he could come over to visit as often as he wanted he just needs to tell me before hand so I can be home. We decided to give our relationship another shot and I got pregnant again immediately. We moved into a house together I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid. He seems to love his kid very much but has no concept of taking responsibility.,Stress
27677,They are always calling me for everything I don't even wanna answer my phone but if I don't I may get yelled at. It has happened. I have spent many days and nights in tears because of the stress of this job and even one morning threw a bit of a fit when our dm made me come in because there was another evaluation on my day off. I had to cancel all my plans that day to go in. I couldn't stop myself.,Stress
27680,And I'm just really confused and don't know how to feel or what to believe or think. Did he kill himself because of me? Did he know I wanted to see him or did they simply never told him? Is it my fault he is dead now and that my little brother has no father anymore? I'm just so confused and overcome with emotions right now.,Stress
27681,She told me she had one more person to interview and that she would get back to me by Monday. I shook her hand and rushed out the store to another place and went to their restroom. I ruined my hair I popped a little of my collar and unbuttoned some of my dress shirts. I added some water stains and even took advantage of a partially full cup of soda in one of the stalls. I spilled it on the rims of my shirt but not entirely.,Stress
27685,I have had mobility issues since I was twenty three following a difficult pregnancy that triggered inflammatory arthritis and fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome. Over the years I've had a few falls due to being very unsteady on my feet at the best of times which have added to my mobility issues. My right ankle and calf are permanently injured I have achilles tendonitis plantar faciitis and the muscle in my calf has tightened so much due to the shortening of my tendons that my foot points instead of sitting normally. I have osteoarthritis in my right hip which slips in the socket and causes a lot of pain and this has all had an ongoing impact on the rest of my body as my back often spasms or locks and I have issues with a frozen shoulder that limits the use of my right arm. On top of all of this I have kidney liver and bladder problems.,Stress
27687,I am so scared that he will realize how fucked up and terrible I am and not want to continue things. I don't want him to go and he keeps assuring me he will not but I am so so scared that sometimes it is overwhelming. I feel like this is a disgrace on my part because logically I know that he very much likes me and he really wants to stick around. But there's a part of me that genuinely believes I am not good enough and that I will not be enough once he realizes that. I am so fucked.,Stress
27689,He would play really loud music on the speaker. It got so bad when he threw the living room table at me.. we got kicked out of at least 4 apartments. At this point we were homeless. He wouldn’t get a job and wanted me to get out and hold a sign and pan handle for money if I didn’t he would drive the car we lived in really fast and say he was going to kill us. He wrecked that car (small wrecks) at least ten times.,Stress
27690,The husband's voice sounds like pure rage the wife's both angry and defensive. A couple of times there were sounds of broken objects. We have never really talked (they don't speak good English) so I'm not sure how to approach them about it. Calling the police feels excessive but I'm also worried someone might be abused. What is an appropriate thing to do here?,Stress
27692,Ive never really had a problem with my education until this semester I feel mislead in my classes i.e (I do great on the homework and then I end up failing the tests). This has lead to me failing or doing not up to my standards in my other classes and its beginning to effect my own self worth. Instead of being confident in myself im resorting to internal hatred and just overall sadness. I am in a relationship with a very loving girlfriend but I feel that if I bring my problems into it it could go sideways and I dont want that. Because of all of this my sleep schedule has not been exactly ideal I usually go to bed at midnight and wake up early for class and the quality of my sleep is not what I would call good (tossing and turning and frequently waking up).,Stress
27693,My life has spiralled into a area I’m not sure I can survive in much longer. Everyone who was close to me have seemingly all decided to just pretend I don’t exist right as I start my third year of Uni. My anxiety levels are usually pretty high this time of year but this last month has been the worst of my life for my emotional well-being. I’m trying so hard but I’m suffering and the meds don’t seem to be helping What do I do,Stress
27694,Kick a man while he's down you sick sick fuck. I'm just trying to get advice and you delete part of my post. FUCK YOU. BURN IN HELL. People like you are why I hate this world.,Stress
27698,Is this common? How did you deal with it? I want to just apologize and make things right but some of the things the other person probably forgot or were just super insignificant. I want to own up to my actions but it's hard. I assume if people find out I was a jerk they'll all hate me and I'll be an outcast and a pariah :/,Stress
27701,Hello my name is jake I am 17 years old and I need some help I'll give you a bit of back story Ever since I was 5 my mother was always drunk everdently she was an alcoholic and whenever she was drunk she got very agressive and to cut a long story short she abused me for over 8 years not only physically but mentally too and when I was 15 I finally spoke out and went to turn to the authorities but they didn't help they sent me back to my mum countless times and in then end I put myself into care I refused to go back I have been in care for a year and a couple months now but ever since just before chirstmas I've been having these night terrors ( which I have reason to believe that it is ptsd ) I have viscous flash backs of my mother doing all them things too me and I wake up screaming sweating and as a instinct ready to fight and it lasts for a good 15 mins which is horrible What I'm trying to get at is is there any coping mechanisms that you can suggest because I feel useless and helpless at this point,Stress
27702,Who do I talk to at this point the Command Equal Opportunity Officer (e-7) who basically says she will look into it but doesn't seem concerned. There is a stigma about asking for help in the Navy and it needs to change. Basically if you take any meds you get treated like a black sheep. If you go to medical and they give you meds you get removed from your duties and everyone else carries your load while you are forced to stand around them not allowed to do anything. If you do get out of the navy because you spoke out about being depressed anxious or having symptoms of PTSD then you would be seperated from the Navy and sent home.,Stress
27704,I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here just what happened.) I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story. I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!) and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened but NOTHING did! It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago and that he had friends offer to help!,Stress
27705,The next couple of days have been mostly normal. A large group of my friends were visiting so I had a good time but that episode made me slightly anxious every now and then. I have no prior history of anxiety disorder or mental illness. For all I know this episode could have been anything or nothing but I do remember feeling a strong sense of anxiety during the tram ride. At the time I was attributing it to being a little paranoid on pot so I wasn't concerned - until I started to lose my vision.,Stress
27708,7) what if there arent enough houses for all the people in this world? ( yes..seriously) we have never lost him he has never been stung by a bee we do not have the news on around him nor has our house been broken into.However he has heard grown ups out in public talking about the recent school shooting. He also gets night terrors and nightmares and is afraid to fall asleep sometimes. how do I help him manage his anxiety in an age appropriate way?,Stress
27710,I’m currently doing EMDR for my severe anxiety issues and depression. We’re going through past instances that have plagued me and are why my mindset is a negative shithole. I had my anxiety in a certain place where I felt comfortable. The anxiety was there but I managed it well enough. Things were not perfect and there was still a lot of things that needed to change in order for me to progress.,Stress
27711,I am 25 years old and recently had to stay with my mother and her new husband. My mom has had issues on and off throughout my childhood but it is only recently that I identified her as a narcissist. We used to be very close (inappropriately so) but last week she disowned me and asked me to move out over a Reddit post she found of mine (not this account). I am moving out on Sunday and have been enduring the silent treatment for about two weeks. I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago and everything is hitting me all at once.,Stress
27714,Certain things will make me feel uncomfortable. as of recently she will jokingly play with my nipples like suck on them or biting them if we are laying in bed and I’m shirtless. This makes very uncomfortable and I don’t like it at all. I’ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I don’t like the feeling of it. She will keep jokingly doing so and tell me stop being a baby or that she is just joking around.,Stress
27716,But in that moment neither my words nor my body made a difference...he did what he wanted.... I wanted to push him kick him shout...but...i couldnt move. There were times he didn't listen to me but I never thought it would lead to him forcing himself onto me. I didn't trust I'd know how he'd react if I did or said anything...He wasn't the gentle and respectful person I thought he was. I left after the shower but when I got home I broke down.,Stress
27717,I was trying to eat my food but my hands became shaky and i then didnt feel hungry. People kept asking me why my hands are shaky and the people across from me laughing at me.

I havent been diagnose for anxiety disorder but i want to been on medication?,Stress
27719,"Anytime I have a scheduled transaction towards my checking account my wages are immediately garnished. However last night was the real wake up call.

Not wanting to face the pathetic reality that I have ""sugar momma"" for a girlfriend I packed everything I own in my vehicle parked it less than a mile away (incase I may have forgotten anything) and slept in it until the battery died.",Stress
27720,Kinda interesting how even when I’m not feeling awful tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if it’s the biological sleepiness or if it’s kinda a pavlovian response because I’m so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway how are you all doing?,Stress
27721,Hi I am 21 years old I used to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety last year but somehow managed to beat it and live like a normal person again. But from time to time i have this weird feeling that I am gonna pass out or something like that my face is pale and I feel this uncomfortable pressure in my eye balls it happens when I'm at university during class or even during normal daily activities. I did some blood tests and everything is fine so is this anxiety again?,Stress
27722,Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage. There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony. Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences it will be hard for him to drop the charges right? He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend. I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....,Stress
27724,I see him in person 1 - 3 times per week almost always at restaurants. If it matters we've never been to each others apartment. It is in his lease that he can't have guests over (???). I've invited him to mine but it hasn't worked out. I have some abandonment issues from friends pretending they like me but actually secretly disliking me so I have anxiety that he doesn't actually like me.,Stress
27725,When first diagnosed I was put on a daily prozac. 3 years later I've managed to wean myself off and just use my klonopin only for the worst attacks. That actually seemed to work well and I've been off the prozac for about a year and even got off Facebook 3 months ago because it was becoming a point of unneeded drama but I'm suddenly getting the depression symptoms again. I've walled myself off from most people and have become less communicative with my husband. I don't like going to our neighbors house because I have a paranoia that 2 of them don't like me.,Stress
27726,I was cleaning my house with bleach got a nasty burn in my throat when I woke up the next day. Day later it went away but the day after that I got the worst body aches chills 100.6 fever and dizziness for 2 days. It all cleared up but I have had this dry cough for 4 days now with no relief it keeps me up at night and I go into these coughing fits. What should I Do?

27735,I haven't posted here yet but as everyone here has probably experienced PTSD is one of the most isolating conditions. Even as an adult surrounded by other adults at school I feel so isolated. It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that has resulted in further alienation. For some reason dissociations in sufferers who are not former military is unacceptable.,Stress
27736,He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done. He kept packing. So I called the police. I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option. The police department chose not to press charges.,Stress
27737,I need help. I need sound advice on how I can overcome this situation. I need brutal honesty. Merci ! Please excuse my grammatical errors,Stress
27738,Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.,Stress
27740,I can't get over this feeling. Nothing feels good. I just finished spring break and I had a chance to work out every day. Even when I was working out I felt overwhelmingly anxious. I can't state concisely what I'm thinking.,Stress
27741,I've never done this before but we always stay at my house so maybe the odds are just greater here? After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit. She said my eyes were open and I don't know if she believes it was accidental... How can I manage this situation? That's all I really need to know I don't know what to do.,Stress
27742,"If they weren't done he would get angry at her. After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money. Instead of paying her back he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted. The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later."" While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.",Stress
27743,She says she's sorry and that she would never have taken it to a physical place and completely rejected the first co-workers request to take it further. However she continued to talk to him and also continued to talk and flirt with the second co-worker when she knew he had romantic feelings. She says she's sorry and has an addiction to being desired. I told her it's not fair to me or the men she's leading on. She agrees and is trying to convince me to stay with her.,Stress
27744,I don't know if I should call it abuse. Fiancé suffers from PTSD & alcoholism... Punched me and threw shit at me at an international airport and almost got himself kicked off the flight. Last night was the 2nd time but far worse. He beat me with a bag he thought I packed and thought I was going to leave him (it was a bag I forgot to unpack and was in the closet). My head was bleeding profusely and I (thank goodness) ran outside and called for help...,Stress
27745,It's like Everyone else is allowed to be frustrated but me. So I use a lot of my UPT (unpaid time off; it's the ONLY time off we get no vacation or anything) for my sister - her wedding (a whole fucking week) her kids' birthdays that she insists I be at and things like their baptisms. And I know I use a lot of my hours on them but overlook it because I love them and know they want to see me. But I only have 6 hours left and each shift is 4 hours. I might have to use 4 of those today because the front of my house is flooded (there's a car stuck there and an officer blocking off people from entering) because I emailed HR and even sent in a picture but this company just doesn't give a fuck and probably won't cancel.,Stress
27749,He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him. He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise. I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him. The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him. And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.,Stress
27750,"""I understand as a woman why you are doing this. But as a mother I am begging you not to press charges. It will ruin his life. Please let us take care of him. We'll set him straight.",Stress
27753,I’m coming to find that my family are rapist sympathizers given the “right” circumstance (ie. sports). How would you want the media to change? What would make it easier to watch the news while also covering newsworthy topics? My head is in a fog still so hopefully that all made sense.,Stress
27755,This is marriage #2 for both of us. Husband's (52 M) ex (51 F) cheated my ex (53 M) had emotional affair leading to ending marriages in the same year. We dated in high school and reconnected as friends started dating about a year later moved in together after a year got engaged 2 years after that. Before getting engaged I found out he was having an emotional affair with a woman who lived about a 5 hour drive away from us. I found out when he left an IM open on his computer found steamy texts when I went to shut off a noisy program.,Stress
27757,I’m just wondering how many of you have A LOT of triggers? I was abused extremely horribly as a teenager and into adulthood and I have horrible ptsd from it. I literally get triggered by everything and anything. Like someone could sneeze and it would sound similar to him and I’d freak. I freak out horribly about everything and the littlest things.,Stress
27762,- kicked me out of the house and was going to make me leave in the middle of the night multiple times while insulting me and hitting me I'm sorry to even post this here but I need a little support right now. He said this to me two nights ago and came into our guest bedroom where I was sleeping the next day and said sorry Kind of. I tried to talk to him about it and he said he was under a lot of stress and that he doesn't need my love or support and he doesn't want to talk about it. Super sorry for the fucked up formatting but y'all get the idea...,Stress
27767,It was a conversation about those things. Over and over. Her name which normally it isn't a trigger but since I've been in a fragile state lately I was just getting dragged down on the inside. I'm so tired. I just wanted to ask them to stop saying it.,Stress
27768,I'm in my third year at uni and starting my diss now (its due in January) and I'm really struggling with feelings of dread and anxiety. I dread waking up knowing I have to do work and I compare myself to how much my friends are working. When i see them working I am just filled with dread and guilt. &#x200B; I keep getting to the point now where when I try and do work I freeze.,Stress
27769,"Do I just need to forget about the ""dumb girlfriend"" incident and stop assuming that he thinks I'm stupid? And how do I do that? Help! tl;dr Because of an unfortunate incident earlier in our relationship I sometimes have a hard time believing that my boyfriend thinks I'm smart. How do we navigate this?",Stress
27770,I need to know what to do. A psychopathic family member was promised MY house for some strange fucking reason for apparently a very long time now. I have an abusive ex that won’t leave me alone and his parents say escape and live with them but he most likely will follow me where I go. He told me he would. Should I get a restraining order before I go?,Stress
27772,My ex sent me a video of a switchblade I asked him why he had that and he said “cutting people up” and then he said “it’s an Italian style switch blade”.. I’m Italian... Anyways he’s put a loaded gun to my head in the past. I’m actually pretty terrified of him now. He also once brought explosives to my brothers house and claimed he “forgot they were there”.. none of my family or our friends growing up believed me when I told them about him. Which is why I can’t talk to anyone.,Stress
27773,I'm curious does anyone know of any programs that provide temporary housing assistance if you have a job? I'm almost broke right now. I really don't want to live out of my car or the shelter while working. Having a comfortable supportive place until I can get my first couple of paychecks would be amazing. I'm worried that my current living situation will ruin my chances to succeed with this job.,Stress
27774,I feel sad for you I feel sad for me. I pray that you will get the help you so desperately need so that nobody else has to endure the terror and horrible horrible physical sexual and emotional abuse you have put me through. I am riding myself of all my shame associated with what has happened. I know now it was all you. I did not do anything wrong to deserve the horrible treatment I received from you.,Stress
27775,He broke contact with the whole family only sparingly speaking to his little sister after she followed his example and split. I think he is very ashamed of his past. He *never* talked about anything like this with me. I’m honestly really worried he thinks I would think less of him if I knew and the idea of that breaks my heart. I didn’t tell him what his sister told me.,Stress
27776,I'm too unstable. Telling parents is not an option. I'm not going to give the easy redemption for them. All this is still suspicion. I know I'm no professional but I'm telling you I'll get help.,Stress
27778,Hi everyone Sorry to ask but today is my Mum’s birthday. This is the first month in ~6 where I haven’t been paid early so until tomorrow I have no money. The issue is it’s my mum’s birth today and she always wants a cake but I am unable to give her one this year. A nice cake from my local supermarket is £10 and I will be paid by work tomorrow so I can repay you soon.,Stress
27781,We couldn’t have Thanksgiving because of money struggles in the family. I am here begging and pleading for help to get some food in our cupboards to help hold us over as long as we can. I’m counting down the days until tax season so we can fill up the pantry! We receive about $700 each year from the Wisconsin Homestead Tax Credit which is what we use to catch up on bills prescriptions and to stock up on food. It’s extremely heart wrenching when my own mother or grandchildren cannot have a bowl of cereal because there’s no milk and guess what no cereal.,Stress
27782,Being in there was hell I cried most of the first few days. I was very disoriented couldn't sleep the windows had metal grates over them. The bathrooms were locked and you had to ask for permission to use the toilets. While I was waiting to use the toilet the nurse came in my room and grabbed the door out of my hands forcefully and I didn't let go (I think its my right to use the bathroom when I need to). She then came back with a bunch of men and they held me down to the bed pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in the butt of some sedative.,Stress
27784,I have a very hard time with trying to find a job from most places I don't get any feedbacks but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company. Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project (which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects) my grandfather is a well known tankie (who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik) not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled (long story short: I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part but thanks to the Hungarian R-word I got some serious shit such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles game consoles phones etc) and probably wanted to take their revenge this way (which is ironic because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist). My father is seriously thinking on kicking me out to the streets if I won't pay which makes me to go back to my mother and my abusive stepfather who cannot accept my autistic quirks implying if I can go back to them and my stepfather will let it all go through.,Stress
27785,Grad school isn’t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month rent is $750) let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school and with 20 hours a week on campus already that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.,Stress
27787,When I take the time to relax and think of something nice like a waterfall or a forest or something like that I then automatically think of how bad people are going to mess it up and pollute and make it worse and just be awful. It makes it hard for me to relax. I try to think of something tranquil and then thoughts like these pop into my head. Meditation isn't that nice for me. My mind just races.,Stress
27788,It feels as if no one understands what I’m going through in my life because I took a while to leave and didn’t tell anyone until now. I really didn’t think it was that bad. Now that I’m out of the situation it still haunts me. I feel guilty and still like it’s all my fault somehow even though it’s irrational and not true. Does anyone else feel like this?,Stress
27791,"I walk up to the door unlock it and open it. It's K. With my boyfriend standing by in sight I ask him what he's doing here. He says nothing but stares at me with this blank stare. Then I get this weird gut feeling and ask ""have you been drinking?"" In which he shakes his head.",Stress
27793,&#x200B; I'm in our room watching some relaxing Youtube videos trying to cheer myself up. My boyfriend wants me to come out and do weekend stuff but the energy is so high out there I think it'll set off an attack. He wants to bad to help but he doesn't know how and I don't know how either. &#x200B;,Stress
27798,I think this is a good conversation to have in person but I likely won't see him for months. Would it be tacky/wildly unromantic to do this over text/email? Additionally I don't want to ruin things between us or make things weird and I'm not sure how to broach the subject. How do I not screw this up? -,Stress
27800,So I knocked and told her to please let me in. She refused I told her I was sorry and I didn’t mean any of the things I said and that I love her very much. She said to go away so I did (we were at her house). Now a whole day passed and she still refuses to talk to me :( I’m worried guilty and just want to hug her and tell her again that I’m sorry. I sent her some messages but she ignored them.,Stress
27801,He has even made a comment to my bf about me being overweight. Being overweight has basically taken over my relationship my mind and my life. This year I am making it a priority to lose the weight especially since I have nothing else occupying my mind like cancer. My confidence level right now is 0 and I feel so fucking ugly and fat. If I just got in shape I know that I would be close to a 10.,Stress
27803,I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age. Should I seek counseling? But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break. I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything. I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,Stress
27804,For example she once tried to stab her mum's boyfriend because she didn't want her mum to be with anyone - they were in their mid 60s. She has been in a lot of fights over the years but in general isn't usually physically violent - it's usually manipulation. I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his. He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very very private. She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.,Stress
27805,This is the first time that i'm opening up about this so please be kind. I'm from India - stereotypically known as the land of doctors and engineers. And while that's just a stereotype my studies give me anxiety. I had my first attack two years ago - and I have been talking to people since then - but my recent graduation exams have left me worse then ever. What i want to know is when was your first attack and how are you doing now?,Stress
27807,First off I want to apologize for posting here so often. I don't have anywhere else to turn to. I recently contacted my abuser. I don't know why I think it's part of my self destructive behavior. And I've realized something.,Stress
27809,The thought of helping people curing diseases and caring for someone makes me happy. Imagine a person who’s an asshole but need help on health I would help him/her. However I need to finance med but I need to work on my current stature to get the money but this job makes me anxious to the point that I am having refluxes because of stress just the thought of working on it. The problem with me is I know I can do for the meantime this job but it was a mistaken path I could have done dev since it involves little customer interaction. I felt helpless because I need the money but feels like I am fooling myself to work my ass up for something that is not my passion.,Stress
27813,No criminal record he’s not on any list he changed his name and moved to a new town and no one there knows what he did and he’s been messaging her. I feel so hopeless. How am I supposed to feel safe? Or be able to sleep? He’s out there consequence free feeling safe enough to message her.,Stress
27815,Hi I'm 14F and because of health issues I missed a lot of school and eventually started homeschooling this year I didn't have any friends at public schools and I just sit in the house all day now. I can't join a sports team because of formerly mentioned health issues and I live in a town where a car is a necessity so it's not like I can walk anywhere but I'd like to make friends or just get out of my house for the first time in months and socialize face to face any ideas as to what I can do. TL;DR: I'm homeschooled lonely and can't join a sports team how do I make friends.,Stress
27816,So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night. I have started dating a guy I'm pretty smitten about and last night we went out with friends and had a really good time but we also had been drinking. Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,Stress
27820,throwaway... sorry if this all sounds very messy. I have a history of child sexual abuse rape in a past relationship and problems with dissociation. So I was feeling like a robot that day again due to stress. I then went to my boyfriend. I told him I am dealing with that again he knows about my problems.,Stress
27822,two months off of work in my favorite city with limitless money and i am more infuriated than ever. all its done is remove my dissociation and now i have inexplicable rage. i just fucking hate everything. i hate this site even and made an ultimatum never to come back. but i have no fucking idea what even to do.,Stress
27824,But now my cognitive processes feel so scrambled up and sluggish. I get so confused sometimes I have trouble filling out simple forms or answering questions on the phone. I'm in my 3rd year at a major university but my brain feels so messed up I don't know if I'll be able to finish. Does anyone else experience this? Have you found anything that helps?,Stress
27826,Should I just go ahead and get help? Am I worried about nothing? Is there a way to lose the worst bits of anxiety while keeping the bits that are perhaps somewhat helpful? Or have I got this all wrong and it's not anxiety (but perhaps something else) that makes me productive etc? Or should I just accept all the awesome things in my life as a totally worthwhile price for feeling worried?,Stress
27827,I had suicidal thoughts while working at the island. I had to cut it short and come back home. I was too sad to continue. Eddy and I reunited and I assumed we were back together since it seemed so. When he got drunk he would literally switch back and forth to being happy and giggly to wanting to die and hating himself.,Stress
27828,Can anyone relate to this feeling? I can’t enjoy myself at things like concerts anymore. I’m not fully present because I have to try so hard to curb feelings of anxiety and hyper-vigilance. When anyone gets too close to me or accidentally touches me I freak out. Tonight I went to a concert and I was so self-conscious and distracted by the fear that I was going to be assaulted that it was difficult to focus on the actual show.,Stress
27833,A few years ago I witnessed an accident at this time of year and I am beginning to remember it again. At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying. I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,Stress

I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste forgetting to call him as soon as I left school etc- but punished severely). Hell even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim. I can't gauge conflict to save the life of me- even if I'm being an absolute ass I'll feel like I'm the one who's being persecuted.

27852,I never thought I’d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that won’t stop. I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesn’t stop. I don’t know if that’s just because it was less than 24 hours ago and I’m still just in shock? It’s just a lot to take in right now and I’m not sure what to do.

27857,I used to take sleeping pills that had a bit of anti anxiety medicine in them but my pcp drug tested me and because I had been found to have been smoking weed ( for my ptsd ) it was either stop coming their for the sleeping pills or weed.

He says he started selling drugs recently to make more money and some of his supply was stolen and now he's afraid his ""friend""/dealer will come after him. I offered to let him spend the night at my house if he felt unsafe but he declined my offer and said that he'll take care of it.

27861,Kinda. But now it’s just weird. He buys us matching clothes tries to get us to do the same shit constantly insists that we’re so similar etc. They try to hold my hands when we go out and when I told my dad I needed her to stop being so touchy with me he guilt tripped the fuck out of me.

I'm just tired.,Stress
27871,Now that I'm approaching middle age I want to tell myself that they're just busy and don't have time to reply. But how long does it take to write a short email or make a brief phone call? Something specific *must* have happened to get them all to turn it off at once. For the life of me I can't think of what it might have been. And that's what bothers me.,Stress
27872,Not because I didn’t have evidence but because none of the evidence was permissible in court. My last order of protection was denied. I’m a survivor of childhood incest. It just seems like no one cares or wants to care about the psychological repercussions any of this abuse has on people. And I’m the one to blame for not being a perfectly normal person.,Stress
27873,already a few months in. Any advice on if/how this can improve or if I should just cut my loses before I get too invested? Thanks everyone! TL;DR boyfriend currently has no motivation to move his life or our relationship forward should I stick around and keep trying or accept incompatibilities? Am I asking for too much?,Stress
27875,The following week my mom let me use her car to drive my brother to another city for an appointment. The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one so I was really excited about driving it around more often. Everything was fine until I got to the actual city and then a woman drove through a red light and hit my mom's car. I held myself together because my younger brother was with me and he has his own depression to deal with he didn't need to see his sister break down. The car was still driveable so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.,Stress
27877,Kyle got out and started contacting me again writing letters to “prove he still knew where I lived” and “being able to get in touch with me regardless of me blocking him”. I have some friends in the police force near me who I informed of the situation. About the same time I started talking to them Kyle was put in jail for separate reasons. Since these two events he has stopped contacting me (thank Christ.) James knows about Kyle but I haven’t told James about the most recent developments because he has had a lot going on (a death in the family health issues among others).,Stress
27882,"I have trouble connecting to it on a personal level but isn't that healthy separation of past/present? I think my present anxieties/self image issues stem from traumatic experiences but I can talk about these things fairly openly in a way that feels rehearsed. I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday but that's not typical for me at least not anymore? I realized most my recent ""panic attacks"" may be ""breakdowns"" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control... I start hyperventilating screaming and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control start throwing things or hurting myself until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.",Stress
27883,I wanted to go to this art school in an expensive city only because this place is wayyyyyyy cheaper then most art schools and it has all the majors I'm interested in which I could use for like storyboards for movies and what not. They have really nice dorms and if I could just get the funding for school I could do that but I have really bad mental illness and I need my cat he checks to make sure I'm breathing at night and comforts me during panic attacks. Which means I'd need an apartment and a job. I'm not against working my ass off I'm just getting down right now no responses to applications can do that. I'm in a state that doesn't even have a real art school.,Stress
27884,For the last week my car has been acting up. Yes it's 16 years old but the only other person to have the car before I did was my 85 year old grandmother who only drove it to either the grocery store or the thrift store so I got it almost brand new. But lately everything g has been going wrong. The gas gage doesn't work the dash lights don't work my tires need to be filled at least once every day the brakes go out often my battery won't start if it gets too cold and now the transmission is starting to have issues. Without a job I don't have money to pay to fix everything.,Stress
27885,It was no longer just about the life and love we were building together. It was no longer about us it was about me and trying to fill this hole within myself.

I see you and Jane are out tonight so as I sit here alone and dying inside knowing that the most important thing in my life is leaving me and I’ll never even see you again doesn’t something inside you feel just a morsel of empathy and reciprocal love back for me and to me and want to give me some chance? Why do I have to be destroyed for this?,Stress
27893,For me that doesn't HELP AT ALL. It just makes me feel like I'm just pissing him off and my problem has suddenly become his minimizing my emotions about it? (I hope that makes sense). He always says I need to be protected but he doesn't understand that it's not an imminent threat in my life anymore but a constant struggle and disability; that my brain works and processes things differently now and always will. I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.,Stress
27894,I've been skipping my classes and haven't gone out with any of my friends because I'm afraid I'm going to get sick when I go out. I'm supposed to go visit my boyfriend at his school tomorrow (I'm on spring break and he's not) and I'm already worrying about if I'm going to get sick and if I even want to go incase I start to feel nauseous and get a bad stomach ache while I'm there.... I'm wondering if anyone else deals with a lot of nausea from their anxiety and what they do to cope with it? I'm terrified of throwing up and so this is like the worst symptom I could ever have.... plus I always have this weird feeling in my chest/throat like something is coming up or is stuck and am belching a lot like tiny burps. I feel like I'm crumbling and am starting to really slow down... My anxiety/depression has never gotten this bad before and I've just been a sad shell in my bed can't even find the energy to turn on my TV and pay attention to anything.,Stress
27896,i never really knew people gave a shit about me and it really meant a lot to me; it still does. but if so many people are here for me and things are going to be okay why am i still afraid of them? why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull? why am i crying right now? i don't understand it i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.,Stress
27897,Has anyone else who's dealt with anxiety their entire lives become very controlling in their relationships as a way to cope? Speaking to my therapist I'm realizing that my method of coping with the intense anxiety I've faced in life was to become so organized that I thought I could control everything. But when situations arise especially with those I'm in a relationship with where I can't control the situation my anxiety goes out of control so I end up lashing out in negative ways. If you have found you were controlling and were able to better yourself can you please direct me on where to turn to do the same?,Stress
27898,"No not really. I thanked my boyfriend and then immediately blurted out ""how am I going to explain this to my mother?""

27900, -student- loans and I’m living a miserable life but I’m working as much as I can without feeling 100% dead inside but I have to pay them up in a week or they default and I don’t know what to do. I would seriously do anything for anyone for the money to help me keep my head above water. I’m completely miserable and I’m trying but I’ve been even more depressed than normal and I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like a heart attack is on my horizon. I spend the bare minimum I starve or drink an 85 cent soda for 3-4 days out of the week.,Stress
27902,I really suck at explaining things so if you have any questions please ask. UPDATE: I gave my casual partner a vague warning about the future and how if the time comes I'll need to make the decision for myself. tl;dr I am stuck in a love triangle with a casual DDLG relationship on one side and sharing of mutual feelings on the other. Multiple things keep the DDLG from relationship from being public and I hate sneaking around. I want to have an open relationship with the other girl.,Stress
27907,I haven’t really complained. Only once when my gram asked me to do a million and one things in a span of a few minutes (go get this go do that) when i was already trying to setup my moms new iPad so she could watch Netflix in the hospital. That all said and done and I feel like shit. Idk if it’s sick but it also feels a hellavua Lot like anxiety.

27910,I'm a freshman in college. I had to move out asap due to a volatile home situation and I'm still struggling with finances and figuring out the real world.

27911,I posted about a month ago and felt pretty defeated (but very grateful to receive anything at all because one very generous gentleman gave me $100) but I am back to the end of the month with a phone bill due tomorrow and dwindling food and gas and rent approaching soon. I’m 25f and 4 months in recovery. I’m working part time to focus on recovery but trying to find a second job so I can stop finding myself in money binds. I have no friends and family to ask for money and have made literally $550 since July working for Bath and Body Works and $200 with DoorDash since August. My rent is $600 and phone bill is $55 and car insurance is $100 which I haven’t even paid this month.,Stress
27913,My problem is if I'm going to date anyone they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need. I don't need coddling or protecting I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out or help me through a flashback. I need someone who can bep-bile present and emotional and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it. Everytime I have had a breakdown and try to express things from the past he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened. He talks about what he'd do to my abusers if he ever found them.,Stress
27916,"I assumed she would answer the question or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy or she would interpret the transference. But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"".

Besides as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question it seemed false.",Stress
27918,I got a very bad feeling but I at first ignored it. The babysitter was a man and someone I had never met! I was scared because I didn't know this man and I didn't understand why her Mother thought it was alright for a man to babysit 2 girls one of them being a child he never had contact with. Her Mom proceeds to leave the house and we're there with this strange and creepy man. I was completely uncomfortable the entire time.,Stress
27919,I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child. I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore.

27922,"I recently went through an event that was extremely traumatic. Without specifying what it was recently everywhere on the news. It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help. Most of my recommendations have been people that are ""off-record"". I've talked a little with them and have talked amongst my friends and they say they do not feel they are any help.",Stress
27923,It’s becoming cyclical for me where I “retreat” and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened. I can’t live like this. I don’t want to live a lie but sometimes the lie is what keeps me functioning. My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing. I don’t know what to do.,Stress
27927,She still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it) but frankly I'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. I do like her as a friend but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. My questions are: should I just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? And regardless of this should I start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?,Stress
27928,I want to move forward with my life but seem to have dug myself such a deep hole that I can't climb out. It just seems to be a vicious cycle of can't get a job because I don't have a place get a job can't get to job because I don't have a car or license can't get license or car because I don't have a job. Don't even have a phone currently (this one will change soon). Can't get any assistance because I have no residency. I feel forever fucked in this spiral of shit that I myself have created but can't seem to flush.,Stress
27930,It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past. I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened. So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did. Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that. Trauma shouldn’t be a competition.,Stress
27934,And we are almost out of groceries until food stamps come in on the 3rd. I don't know what to do without him but I'm covered in bruises and in so much pain. I am worried because my 9 year old watched the whole thing and was so scared she was shaking. Sorry this is so long. I guess I just needed to vent.,Stress
27935,And then I just want it to go away. I dont know what to do about this I feel like the world doesn't want me to talk about it. It's to uncomfortable for people...

27936,I beg him to let go of me so I can get my phone and call my dad. I bang on the floor and scream for help to try to get the downstairs neighbours' attention. He mocks my crying and tells me he's not doing anything to me that I'm freaking out over nothing. We're struggling against each other his elbow hitting my face his arm occasionally choking me.

The emergency funds I had are now gone as my apartment recently got broken into. I have no family and am truly at a loss here in las vegas.

Being a narcisist she can't stand when I give anyone more attention or devotion than her.,Stress
27967,Thank you for reading and for your time. Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her. I never snuck out never got in trouble at school no drugs no drinking no bad friends tried to keep my grades up as best as I had time for and never ever back talked; even though I dreamt of serving it to her one day. My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted they were rather spoiled and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted. Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.,Stress

27978,I'm male and i live with my partner of 4 years. We have a 12 month old baby boy who is a very loved and cherished child. Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town). I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of. The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.,Stress
27980,Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok. I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life. I'm not strong enough to take care of myself to fight back to leave. And I can't work I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety how am I supposed to survive? My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.,Stress
27984, I feel like I have no personality or sense of self and my mind will take sudden turns every week or so. I can get sudden obsessions for things and then drop them and lose interest instantly because my whole set of core values ideas and principles changes constantly. And I've seen people saying that it's normal. I highly doubt it's normal to change so drastically and so quickly because I have to accommodate to a new personality every single week and it's disturbing. Actually there were times when I changed from one day to the other and it's so disturbing because I didn't know what was happening to me...I just woke up feeling and being completely different like something changed everything about me overnight.,Stress
27985,I saw a shadow figure standing in my bedroom door... so I'm camped out in my mom's room. I have bipolar I as well so it's likely that's the cause of the hallucinations. &#x200B; I can't take this. I've had several anxiety attacks in the last few weeks; twice I was sent home from work about half an hour early.,Stress
27986,I have been always told that I was a burden a waste of space and that I was a fuck up even tho I'm the only one in my family 2 get any qualifications nevermind getting into uni. I'll most likely end up homeless as I can't even work as I have little work experience and I try part time jobs just 2 end up having a panic attack early on which got me fired each time. My friends are all at uni doing well 2 which makes me feel worse while I'm at home being a sack of shit who stays indoors all day with no social interaction other than my parents berating me about life. I don't even know what 2 do and it's killing me. My friends constantly remark about me being a mess.,Stress
27987,I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice so I wouldn't put it passed her. So I'm writing this in the parking lot of my college afraid to go home. Awesome,Stress
27989,Already borrowed what I can from family and friends living on my own and rather exhausted that. I'd rather not share my specific adress in public so PM if you want to help. Got no preferences but a kebab or pizza with varied stuff in it would be great for nutrition. Hate asking for this but I'm at a low point and getting rather desperate. If ordering isn't the thing for you a small amount of money to buy something cheap at the store is just as good.,Stress
27990,Every minor detail feels just so overwhelming that I feel suffocated and panicky all the time.

How did you preserve your mental health and do the best that you could? Thanks so much.,Stress
27991,I simply stayed home and did nothing I was basically a shut-in hiding from the world. I had really awful anxiety at one point I never went to the doctor for it but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend who helped me get through it. Then everything changed I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious) minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society). Then I started reading more books to improve myself and that was when I started to earn some savings. I returned to school and the first semester back I managed to get As in half of my courses.,Stress
27993,Why did I have to scream in pain? Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school when he would torment and bash me]. I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side. Once the wood splintered and went into my back. Still no-one stopped him.,Stress
27994,I have had two or three or more reoccurring dreams of me cheating on my boyfriend.. and they are so real that I actually feel awful when I wake up or like it actually happened. I've been spooked when I've woken up because it's actually felt like he left and it happened.. can someone shed some light on what this means? my boyfriend is 18 and I am 19 I am female he is male. we have been in a relationship for around 6/7 months. Recently me and my boyfriend had been going through a tough stage and I've been carrying a huge amount of guilt and I've been feeling like I'm not a good person at all...,Stress
27995,While my friends and myself included have high hopes that this will work out I’m petrified because I am putting my feelings on the table. I’m going to be so damn vulnerable. While he’s expressed and shown signs that he’s just as into this as I am if not more so I’ve also never done this before. I’ve only been in 1 (college) relationship before this followed by 3 years of singleness and ultimate casual fuckery. I know my feelings for him are real and I owe it to myself to fight for a chance of a relationship with someone I feel so strongly for.,Stress
27996,That’s it for me. Bye world. I run and hide inside a key repairs store. The shop attendant give me a worried look. I cannot move even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.,Stress
27999,Do I force myself to move forward? Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd? I feel like they’re so out of line. I’m all over the place. Just someone please help.,Stress
28000,&#x200B; Hey everyone Being that Hurricane Florence just occurred less than a month ago my personal experience with Hurricane Florence consisted of having my maternal extended family evacuated from Craven County and coming to stay with my family in Wilson having to have family members be rescued from their home due to a severe flash flood and dealing with the shock and emotions of loss once returning. On top of that two of my family members have been displaced and all of them are still in the stages of recovery. This is the first natural disaster that has left a major impact on my family as far as trying to find resources and dealing with insurance adjusters and etc.,Stress
28001,As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people. It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,Stress
28002,When we returned we discovered that one of our beloved pets' health had taken a turn for the worse and we had to them euthanized so that was a setback. We still have not been able to pay rent for May. Our landlords are trying to work with us but I believe they are becoming impatient also since the 5th there is an additional $5 owed for every day that it is late so the amount is growing. We are also still very behind in our utility bills. I was able to negotiate something with the company that I finance my car through so that it would be easier to make the payments but could still use some help paying my insurance this month before it is cancelled again (It was cancelled briefly in April but I was able to get it reinstated).,Stress
28004,Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms however we do live in the same house. Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own. I do plan on leaving but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here. I want to share what has led to this point because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic weak in incapable of accomplishing anything. Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.,Stress
28006,Cigarettes used to help but they don't anymore. Alcohol helps but then it comes back worse the next day. In the months that it's not happening I'm well-adjusted. I thrive. But then my luck changes someone starts listening to music next door or revving an old engine in their yard and all my progress collapses.,Stress
28010,So long story short my parents are terribly abusive I'm almost 30 and it took me this long with the help of my wife to realize this. Lots of things happened too many to list in a single post but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother. We had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency and that's when it happened with my father in the room his eyes glued to his cell phone. We involved CPS the police but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything and with their investigation they could not press charges against him. After their investigation was complete we informed my parents of what happened and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.,Stress
28011,I'm just really scared in general of not living up to expectations my partner may have. A lot of my life is built on trying to be exciting fun or entertaining I'm just scared I won't be able to keep it up for my partner. The last thing I want them is to describe their boyfriend (me) as bland or boring but I feel like that's how I'll make them feel and it'll just lead to heartache. So I've come to the most recent conclusion (after seeing my two best friends get girlfriends and me being the awkward loser who can't get one). That maybe I'm not the type of person who's built for relationships.,Stress
28014,I was at work today and this guy I just met was just exuding this layer of confidence he was; to an extent everything I wanted to be when it came to my relationships with others. There was no reason to hate him but I just felt this serious sense of envy toward him. He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone like the people that I wanted to talk to but could never he had already been there and done that. Now nothing is stopping me from doing what he has already done but like I feel like that entire pathway has just been blocked off because of this envy. I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.,Stress
28015,We were doing so good.” I’m feel as if I can’t be angry at any of his actions and my words mean nothing and my threats are empty. He makes me feel so horrible about myself when I even show the slightest bit of distance from him he treats me as if I owe him sex. Never forces me to but will bring it up constantly about how we haven’t and it’s just “makes him feel so bad and self conscious about himself” I don’t know what to do I told him I wanted to move back home and he went in behind me and unpacked my bags as I packed them.,Stress
28016,That was nice. But now that we're close to the point of no return with a flight booked so he can come see her(I agreed to travel out of our house for the week) and they seem to be bonding big time(I love you's abound) I'm not sure what to do with myself. On one hand I want to let loose and detach let her have fun and do so myself. If it leads to a new LTR for her awesome. But what kills me I guess is the uncertainty.,Stress
28022,And I really don't know what to do. This isn't nearly the first time he lied and there have also been other things (like him being unemployed for 6 months and not looking for a job while his parents pay foe everything and he lives with me). But I get that life can be hard and it sometimes can get you down. But I just feel like my trust is broken over and over and over again. And I don't know what to do.,Stress
28025,I was venting how pissed off she made me to one of my friends. I didn't know [3M] was listening to our conversation. He asked me and my friend what a period was. My friend took him to his mother who was in the kitchen. She just told us to keep an eye on him while she did some things.,Stress
28026,For example I'm selling something that's worth £50? You can have it for £10. I hate it I want to cry. I've had items listed for about 2 weeks they're all responsibly priced or under and I'm having to accept low ball offers as I have no other choice. I would never let myself in a million years do this if I wasn't homeless but the clock is ticking and I need to move.,Stress
28032,It's not really safe for me to be driving. I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping. Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work). Is this something a service dog would be helpful for?,Stress
28035,This is so hard to write about for me. Attempting to describe what I've been through cuts me really deep down and spins me through flashes of pain tears and the deepest depression. I really feel kicked when I'm already down. So please forgive me for the winded intro and shaking writing style. It has honestly taken me a week just to get to this point.,Stress
28039,"I feel alone because I feel like people don't think ""I was having a panic attack"" as a legitimate excuse to miss something. I don't even feel like others with panic attacks 100% get it because I don't really get that feeling of a heart attack or anything I feel like my panic attacks are weird and all the stuff I read about ways to help seem to be for people who get the heart attack feelings. I get a panic attack and then get anxious about the panic attack and it's just a big cycle. I try to open up to people but they don't really understand. I just want to be normal.",Stress
28042,I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time I am afraid of what happened or what may happen. I am afraid the world the earth the skies the stars aliens humans animals whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl. I am afraid of what I am or what I might become. I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring or normal or average or weird or some fucking hippie or some fucking stupid hard-headed person.,Stress
28044,Before it happened I had been good friends with him and I admired him a lot as a child. I don't want to ruin his life and whenever I meet him I act normal and happy. When I talk about him I smile and act normal. Sometimes I feel like I can forgive him for what happened but sometimes I have nightmares and I feel dirty. I think of what happened a lot.,Stress
28045,I just got a new job and I won't get paid until the 18th. I've only been unemployed for a week now the company I worked for closed and after bills I have no money. I was already trying to get on my feet from being let go from my long-term job in October. If you could help me I will contribute to this sub when I can pay you back reciprocate in any way that I can. I don't have family that I can ask for help (both parents are deceased no siblings not close with Aunts and Uncles).,Stress
28047,I also want to set the record straight with my family. What should I do? Tldr : I dislike my mom for legitimate reasons. She's telling my family it's because my head is all messed up from my mental illness. It's gotten back to me and is making me angry and making me feel victimized and weird about myself all over again.,Stress
28051,I legitimately do not know anyone who has survived this and I feel like i'm not even human any more. As I type this i'm sobbing because it's all just so FUCKING truly disheartening. I used to be a person. I feel like a ghost now. Are there any steps I can take at all whatsoever to start my turn back into normalcy or am I trapped inside of this until I either die or claw my way out of whatever hole i've fallen into?,Stress
28054,"I take solo back packing trips and my friends really see me as someone fearless and free-spirited. It makes opening up about my mental health issues kinda difficult because they can't ""see"" me acting this way. I have a lot of anxiety and depression issues around my romantic relationships. I also have depersonalization issues and want to be alone more often then not. I think the fact that I can be so outgoing and positive most of the time my friends don't realize that I struggle quite a bit some days.",Stress
28056,So I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid. I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it. I really like her and trust her but the guided questions she asks remind me of how few specific details I actually remember. Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore and my body felt all weird and flat my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it. It's like that scene in Inside Out where the characters become abstract shapes for awhile?,Stress
28057,Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day. My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell. I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting. Sorry for the rant it’s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school. Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.,Stress
28058,"She has a history of being extremely over the top and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know. She did apologize a good day later but only very vaguely about using cuss words and in a ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" kind of sense. I'm guessing a traditional ""we need to talk it's just not working out"" approach would just end up with her blowing up again and since all my past relationships ended very amicably I'm not sure what to expect. Because she can be incredibly toxic I've considered just blocking her and essentially ""ghosting"" but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation. How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?",Stress
28059,? What if I am at a friends party and a man whispers in my ear that he likes to stare at me so he can touch himself later....but he is dating my friend and he knows I don’t want to upset her?? ? What if I am in the car with a man and some lady cuts him off and he gets road rage and says he wants to “drag her out of the car by her hair and cut her nipples off” but then later says he “obviously didn’t mean it”?? ?,Stress
28060,"It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about then cry and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....) I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works? Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do ""stress relieving activities"" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5?",Stress
28061,It’s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to “protect” me. He won’t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I don’t answer (I don’t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying). I understand that the events were traumatic for Tom. I recognize that every time I go to a follow up medical appointment he is frightened. I understand that the fact that I still take medication scares him.,Stress
28062,And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past but I will seize upon something in these moments anything and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb. And he is there just reminding me gently... this isn’t happening right now. This is your past this isn’t our present. I’ve never lied to you. I’ve always kept my promises to you.,Stress
28063,I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,Stress
28064,Unfortunately it also affects pretty much everything in my life including working memory and everyday events. It didn't happen daily or even weekly but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it so I always kept quiet and didn't say much and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either. The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown. I was wondering if maybe now that I know why I most likely struggle with memory I can go back to get more solid treatment options? If so who should I see for help?,Stress
28065,No that's not an exaggeration but I wish I was. While I was driving last Tuesday I got extremely lightheaded sweaty and then pulled over and vomited blood all over the interior of my car. After a few moments of wonder if 'this was it' and deciding 'it definitely wasn't it not on a highway' I snapped by myself back to what life was left and drove to the next exit to find help. My SO has a great summary of why this ended up costing so much money but it's a sequence of very unfortunate events. That's even before the fact that while I was intubated and unconscious someone lifted the bag of all my clothes wallet.,Stress
28067,I've never even told anyone this because it makes me feel like a 32-year-old loser. But now I have no pride to lose by saying it so there it is. **I don't want to die but the thought of living in a place I hate and having no control of my future is a worse fate.

28069,She is in need of some house repairs and a reliable car. Her fixed income and family support isn't enough to get everything done. The van she’s driving has some serious problems. The transmission is dying and there's no heater or defroster. The lights blinkers and brakes don't always work right due to electrical problems.,Stress
28070,However this was 5 months ago and I have heard nothing about the referral. Things are going downhill (not with my eating which is good! ) but my PTSD symptoms are loud. I'm not sleeping my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house. I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.,Stress
28071,yesterday I almost had sex with someone. but when it was happening I felt only halfway there. and now my memory of it is hazy and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective I see it from like above me. like it wasn't *actually*happening to me. I genuinely enjoy having sex but I would like to know ways to lessen my trauma symptoms and stay present during it.,Stress
28073,Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back. If I do I will occasionally see places and buildings connected to bad memories. When visiting my town now I am OK seeing those places but I don't like it so I avoid them. My choices are moving back or sell and start a new life elsewhere. So I ask if anyone else have done a similar move back to your hometown and managed well?,Stress
28076,So my roommate recently moved out and our apartment is pretty empty and ever since she moved out i’ve had the worst anxiety attacks and have been kinda depending on my boyfriend and spending time with him to distract me but he works night and that’s when my anxiety is the absolute WORST. everything flutters through my head. like i think i’m annoying him by asking him to spend so much time with me?? (he’s never expressed this. he’s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice) but i feel like i’m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because i’m alone and i feel useless like no one care???,Stress
28077,Disability allowance doesn't seem like it would be enough to cover even just my rent never mind food (for me and my pets) and lighting and heating. I can't take my cat and my dog into a shelter. I don't know what to do. I feel like I just have to come to terms with how he is and learn to live with it but I'm miserable all the time. I don't have any friends anymore.,Stress
28081,Hi Im a 19 year old kid dealing with Agoraphobia over the past year. Very boldly said Agoraphobia is the fear of going to public places sometimes to even leave the house. The past week some very unpleasant things have happened in my household. I told my parents about what I've been dealing with a while back.,Stress
28084,"There's nothing I can say or do that will alleviate her worries. In the past I've tried to solve things but that doesn't help. I've tried just listening and agreeing or offering comments like ""that does sound bad"" or ""I understand"" but those don't seem to help either. Does anyone have advice on what I can do or say to not cause anger or start a fight? I'm at a loss as to what I need to do or be for her.",Stress
28087," I just stop doing productive things talking to people remembering appointments etc. I am unemployed and almost broke but looking for work is causing me to feel like I can't swallow or get a full breath. I find that I have played video games all day surfed Reddit or this morning I read reviews on a book that is coming out for almost 2 hours. I am not on meds though I am trying Gaba since I had some anyway. To make it even more fun my sister is mad at me because I am ""chronically self centered"" because I forgot to get back to her about possibly getting together for dinner because I am shut down.",Stress
28089,But I was feeling more and more lonely... like I couldn't trust or rely on her. It was tearing me to pieces and I was always anxious. Finally after a breakdown I had on christmas over my fears and the lack of help from my partner in healing from this she broke up with me. I went home the next day and we haven't spoken since. I've been devastated.,Stress
28091,The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake. This happens for hours. I forget the scientific name for this but it doesn't really matter. I've had it happen before to me but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping. Like fucking why?,Stress
28092,Wtf. I did this to myself. I knew I needed to study and I just kept putting it off and putting it off. I knew I didn’t do well but I didn’t think I bombed it so fucking hard. I’m going to have to lie to everyone about it.,Stress
28094,I drove the 10 minutes home with my fiance on the phone helping me count my breathing. I got home and collapsed. I couldn't breathe. My neck and chest hurt. I was hysterical.,Stress
28095,Today we had a really bad fight and she’s at home while I’m outside... I don’t think I can go back anymore and I have nowhere to go with the very little money I have on me and only the vaguest sense of what to do. I’m an 18 year old non binary and have had a shitty relationship with my mom ever since my dad left when I was 8. I live in a drug heavy area that is riddled with gangs and is definitely not safe at night. Shelters nearby are full I don’t have a car and no friends or family to turn to.,Stress
28096,"Therefore it should probably come as no surprise that I sprung the question of ""What exactly are we doing here?"". Well that backfired as he alluded to the fact he was too freshly out of a long term relationship and didn't want to commit yet (Jason had been single for more than a year and it was a 3 year relationship). I bit my tongue until it bled and told him that was okay because we had more friends in common by that point despite saying I needed some direct space for a few weeks or more. Unfortunately what followed could have not been more violent. Not the type of physical violence but emotional tension and turmoil fueled by running into each other at social settings and by alcohol.",Stress
28097,But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care she actually seems to but I cannot understand it. I did not start therapy because I thought she would care I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide it would be wrong so therapy is the thing I figured. Now I feel like it is all that I live for a part of me really likes how kindly she is. But another part of me feels tied down these days I am getting tired of this town and want to pick up my pack and go on down that open road just as I have 16 times in these past 15 years and she is the only reason I don't.,Stress
28098,I've been seeing the same one since then and she'd helped me process so much help me recognize and start to move past a lot of things... I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee to being able to accept the things that happened in the past and remind myself that they are in the past and be able to interact with him again even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore. I care about him his wellbeing but... That familial bond isn't there he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff a couple days after walking out... The only time I ever stood up to him. He made some snide remark about my mother and I told him to go ahead and run from his problems like he always does and he backed me into a corner and shook me screamed over me when I collapsed until my mother came home and made him leave.,Stress
28099,With all of this garbage happening to me I find it hard to keep my chin up and to not be negative. By anticipating the worst and vocalizing it I feel as though I have a better chance of avoiding the worst because I'm still suffering (making myself unlikable or making a fool of myself). Additionally if the situation turns out better than expected I will be pleasantly surprised and not let down when something goes wrong. Because of this my relationship with my family is horrible as well. I don't want to lose one of my few friends over this but I have no idea how to change or if such a thing is even possible.,Stress
28100,It feels great but I'm worried. I tried to kill myself one year and one month ago. I am prone to depression. I am worried about crashing too hard and I have kids to care for. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?,Stress
28101,Eventually I reported the texts as they kept coming and I recieved verbal backlash from his friends for doing it (I live in a small community running into him or his buddies all the time). Then radio silence. I felt minor relief every day I didn't hear from him or his friends. After his second appearance in court he pled not guilty to charges of uttering threats and assault. I was shocked.,Stress
28103,I don't know what to do right now. I'm having so much anxiety and I feel that there is no hope for me right now. It took a lot of effort to post this. I panic very easily. I also have trust issues.,Stress
28105,Help me out here fellow anxious if we gather maybe we could create an elaborate plan to help me avoid this idk I have phone phobia. These are really important conversations that I'll be calling to have and a lot depends on my explaining things and my demeanour and a lot of things could go so terribly wrong and I'm just so absolutely socially inept and phone calls are one of the worst ways for me to say words and make sense and - please help. 😔😔,Stress
28109,I got upset and called the dogs in and closed the door. When he came in he avoided me at first and when I confronted him about lying and sneaking around he defended it by saying it's my fault that I'm not okay with it. I've never been okay with it and i feel like I've been lead on throughout this entire relationship. The fact that he would prioritizing getting high over comforting me really hurts my feelings. I'm tired of feeling like a plant is more important then me.,Stress
28111,I started to get depressed but was personally unaware. My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating was moody not sleeping and laying in bed all day. She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down. All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears. I told her I had been thinking about suicide.,Stress
28113,I wondered if anyone else had a similar place that they always found themselves in. I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space. I'll find myself camped out sobbing on the floor but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out. Secondly; if it's not helping me recover how can I make the rest of my house more appealing? I'm not consciously choosing to end up in the kitchen it's just where I go.,Stress
28115,I once went to the hospital and needed hand surgery so I messaged her when I found out and said “hey mom I’m in the hospital I’m having surgery tonight thought I would let you know.” She never came to visit and she never even asked what kind of surgery it was. What do I do? I feel like I’m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear. I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me? She just sees me as the fuck up causing her annoyance.,Stress
28116,I'm trying to figure out what I learned that is good from it. but all I can think of is that I learned no one can be trusted including myself people are inconsistent and unstable people don't know themselves if love exists then it doesn't mean much and even if you truly believe that someone else cares about you and wants you in their life to the point where you finally don't question it they can cut you off and start treating you like you're worthless without a moment's notice. the more I process what happened the more I realize there is truly no hope for me finding the kind of relationship I hope for and there is really nothing else worth living for besides that. so fun stuff. right?,Stress
28117,I'm gonna try and keep this as short as possible> We met 6 months ago and it was instant chemistry. We fell in love pretty quickly and we used to talk all the time about how surprised we were at our feelings and how we had never felt like this before. Anyway a month ago he started calling less he would still drive the few hours to come and see me but the communication between us seeing each other was lacklustre. I'm not usually clingy but we used to talk on the phone several times a day. this turned into a 5 minute call.,Stress
28119,Since I was fifteen my stepdad when he returns home from work drunk. Always ask me to massage his naked back by stepping on it almost every night. Even if it's midnight he'll make my mom wake me up even tho I don't want to. But I'll comply because I was afraid to refuse as he could get quite angry if I do so. I don't know what's going on inside my mom's head at that time but I just assume that she's too powerless too afraid of my stepdad.,Stress
28122,"I suddenly became very weak dizzy and tired..spending days in bed.

It wasn't until I had had countless tests done that came back clean..and went to the ER one last time in desperation to figure out what was wrong that the doc sent me to the pysch as he suspected depression and anxiety (I had lost 10lbs by then..and didn't weigh much to begin with). I was diagnosed with moderate-severe clinical depression and anxiety..the pysch ruled out CFS and lyme etc since my symptoms would come and go and kept changing by the day. Was prescribed ssri meds..but this gave me the worst panic attack I have experienced in my life..aaand another ambulance ride..",Stress
28123,The man who abused me his mother is a political figure. I SUSPECT she is using her wealth and influence to keep her sons abuse secret. The family has been blaming me for my abuse denying it happened threatenung me into changing my story and generally defaming my character. I can't prove it but suspect this may have happened to a girl before me. Is there a way to expose this family?,Stress
28128,And really that's why I'm typing this post. I want to know for certain if I was witnessing a domestic violence incident (feel free to delete this post if otherwise - again this is a throwaway so I don't mind) if there's anything I could and/or should have done differently there and if there's anything I can do to help in case this happens again (which knowing my job it will). I'm wondering if I should have slipped her info to a hotline or lied about calling the police or *something* - in the back of my mind I keep telling myself there was something I could have done here. Any ideas? EDIT: In case it isn't clear I DID call the police - I just didn't inform them of my domestic violence suspicions until they arrived due to what happened between the call and their arrival.,Stress
28131,It sucks. I know I need help. I want to get help. I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years possibly longer). I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.,Stress
28136,But for now and until I'm on the proper road to recovery I just feel no need to have sex and it worries me more than anything. He says sex is natural and in-the-moment but I find myself having to plan everything down to what to say and do in advance. Sex just doesn't come naturally to me. This has been posing a major threat to my sexual identity and I fear if I initiate tomorrow I'll just burst into tears in the middle of it all. I'm so so scared.,Stress
28141,(I suffer from Major Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia and I wrote this as an example of what I feel on an average day so that people who don't have mental illness can understand) Hollowed out doesn't quite cover the feeling. Because inside this shell are millions of raw nerve endings feeling everything that brushes by. Everything is so raw. Between the mental and physical pain it's incredibly hard to stay grounded.,Stress
28142,"I don't ""feel"" in this anymore but I honestly can't tell if I just can't let bygones be bygones or if I'm looking at this objectively. If I do break it off it's going to crush her personally AND add the awkwardness of her telling her friends and family its off. So I don't want to do it unless it's you know really what's needed. And if I do leave how do I mitigate someone who has threatened suicide at the action of me leaving? **edit**: Thanks everyone.",Stress
28143,He’s claiming I beat him in that fight. I had to go to court and be treated like I was the abuser and the whole time he sat there next to me. A protection order was written and I nor my daughter can go home. I have a 30 day to vacate of face eviction from my landlord and I lost my job over all of this. My pre trial is next month and my lawyer seems like he has no idea about my case.,Stress
28144,Hello So I've had chronic social anxiety since I can remember. I had a pretty traumatic childhood which has resulted in me being socially awkward and very nervous in social setting. Fast forward to this week- I've been invited to a party this weekend. I would love to go but to be honest I'm very scared to go.,Stress
28145,I've been feeling off the past day where I felt I was gonna get sick and just felt weird I'm at my dads house visiting and have diarrhea now and my back hurts I think it's from this bed. And now I'm starting to tell myself maybe I'm having a heart attack. Maybe I felt chest pain a second ago but can't tell if it was real or not?? Someone tell me I'm crazy and I'm ok,Stress
28146,I feel terrible because we never do anything fun. We never go to the zoo or go to the movies because it’s usually too late and I’m too drained by the time I pick him up. Needless to say this lifestyle is absolutely killing me. I am miserable. I have zero friends I see my wife a few hours a week because of our opposite schedules and I’m drained.,Stress
28147,My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore. Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep? Every time? My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse. How long until I start to see improvements?,Stress
28150,I'm fat unattractive unmotivated and best of all six figures in student loan debt and not even graduated yet! I'll never be able to afford living on my own so there goes the last little bit of hope for dating though relationships don't seem great to me anyway. I've fucked up my future lol. I have constant stomach pains and stiff pains everywhere from all the anxiety I feel on 24/7 basis. Also my health is declining as well so that's fun.,Stress
28151,Friends and loved ones (who don't have anxiety) keep telling me to relax and since it's such a busy place it's nothing personal and to not think it worry about it. Which I'm sure is 100% true but not matter how many times it's said anxiety never believes it. I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while. I've been so good about keeping my anxiety in control and not putting myself in anxious situations and this job pushed that (being the public eye and fucking up is one my biggest triggers) but the pay and reputation of the company is widely known and it's one of the most wanted jobs in my town. Does anyone have any advice or maybe gone thru something similar and came out on top?,Stress
28152,I don’t know how it’s physically possible to be this anxious on this level of medication. To be fair my anxiety and racing thoughts about going back to the first employer are so bad that I can’t even really watch TV so healthy coping mechanisms are pretty sparse. I’m really only posting this because I seriously can’t believe that a) I can physiologically sustain this and b) that I still have been going to work every day. I guess I come home and break down every day too so there’s that. I wish so bad I hadn’t done that and it’s like my brain is living in this loop of both regret and fear as well as rage at myself for thinking that would be the answer.,Stress
28154,I have a short term plan but nothing long term at all. I’m assuming she’s going to shut off my phone in the next 24 hours so I’ll have no access to texting or calling services until fiancé can afford to put me on his plan. Unfortunately he may lose his job because he was living with me and my mom. Today we had a really bad fight and she’s at home while I’m outside... I don’t think I can go back anymore and I have nowhere to go with the very little money I have on me and only the vaguest sense of what to do.,Stress
28156,I'm not exaggerating in that I legitimately 100% thought I was going to die. I don't think I've ever been so scared. I keep a diary and reading back on what I wrote at that time makes me cry at the memory. Something else new I've been experiencing is numbness. I've never felt numb before but it's been happening more lately.,Stress
28159,I feel so damaged by my childhood that I feel like I could never be fixed. Everything he's said is true about me. I am stupid crazy cunt bitch whore and people only want me for my body. I feel so ready to just go. I hate myself so much.,Stress
28160,She hangs up; told me she was going to; but she leaves. That was a bit frightening. But I guess at that stage the police were already here because the abuse from him starts. “Oh you actually called the fucking cops did you?” “Why would you call the fucking cops?” “I can’t believe you’d call the fucking cops”. Three days later I’ve just checked the phone.,Stress
28162,My heart races and my hands start to sweat I immediately feel as if I need to pee and then worry as there’s no bathroom (on the train at least). The unknown is the problem here – how long will I be trapped? I know this is stupid – I know I am fine I know in all likelihood we will be moving again shortly but it’s the constant what ifs that set me off. I look around and everyone else looks perfectly calm – perhaps mumbling at the inconvenience but I am gripped with fear. I hate it.,Stress
28163,Let alone his assault charges from beating her RIGHT? If it did what would be her options with the issue of the lease she wouldn't be able to afford? I desperately want to help her with this situation. I feel like if I can help her and choose not to anything that happens to her becomes my fault. I refuse to let that happen.,Stress
28165,I'm not mad but it makes it very hard to compete as I'm quickly figuring out that my school was fairly easy and I did not try very hard. Which yes it is my fault but I didn't think I was going to have to compete with the best of the best. Just know the course well. I have always been able to apply myself endless amounts of will power with a drive to learn. So yeah I thought I could learn what I needed to know but it's more than that it's knowing EVERY little fucking thing about everything because that's how much everyone else knows.,Stress
28166,Needless to say that is all a lie from him He is here from DSS/Social Services just like I am. What I am worried about is my safety and security. This guy is obviously mentally ill and a drug addict and alchie and now I am really concerned that he will do something to me because I stood up to him and his nonsense bullshit. How should I proceed....Call Social Services and turn him in? or call the police next time he harasses me?,Stress
28167,I am not even sure what to say. My girlfriend was really really mad. Not at my family they're just basing this off what they hear but at my sister. And honestly I am really mad too. What the fuck could she be saying about me?,Stress
28170,And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks. So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day. So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass my other mental illnesses acting up and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it. I just can't fucking win. I'm so so tired.,Stress
28171,I can get from feeling super bad (aka anxiety) to feeling super good with just one single thought (they're most of the times exaggerated). And then with another thought I can get from feeling super good to feeling super bad. This is a matter of just seconds and these switchs can last for hours stop and then come back again. When I get the bad feelings it's just awful and the only way I can cope with them is thinking of a way of killing myself. Then when I get the good ones I completely forget about the sensation the bad ones gave me and I see the bright side.,Stress
28173,It can take weeks until the problem is solved or I realise I was anxious over nothing. Recently I'm moving home due to family circumstances and it's something I didn't want to really do yet but I am having to and the place I'm moving to is lovely but I'm really anxious over it and whether I'm doing the right thing. These thoughts I'm having are causing this really dark awful feeling. Is this feeling common? I wondered if this feeling is my intuition but I don't believe it is I think it's purely anxiety.,Stress
28174,Hi everybody I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old. I was also a competitive swimmer growing up and these issues started flaring up when I was moved into an age group with a very strict and demanding groups. 1.5 hour swimming sessions (4k yards) 6 days a week with a 30 minute dryland practice everyday or every other day I believe. I had swam maybe one meet before getting placed into this group and was completely overwhelmed.,Stress
28176,Over the past couple of years I've been getting increasingly afraid of road trips. I've been terrified of dying in car accidents. I don't know entirely knowing where this fear is coming from. I was in a super minor fender bender as a teenager but that was it. In college I lived in a city with insane traffic and regular accidents but I never experienced an accident myself.,Stress
28177,This isn’t so much a cry for help but I just want to rant about all my problems somewhere and this seems like the place. I’ve had anxiety for a few years now but this year I’m full on depressed. I’ve considered running away so many fucking time but I always feel bad for those I’m trying to leave. I’ve never self harmed (thankfully) but I’m always bummed out and paranoid. College is surprisingly the only thing that doesn’t make me anxious.,Stress
28178,Perhaps as a result I feel awful about wanting more from him I feel like it's incredibly ungrateful of me because he does do so much good for me and is really good to me in so many ways. Especially with my depression and stuff he deals with a lot of household stuff in addition to working way more than I do. I feel like shit for writing this post. **TL;DR - SO of over a decade is great to me in many ways and shit to me in other ways I feel awful when he's shit to me but also feel guilty as fuck about expressing it because of all the times he's amazing to me. Wondering if this is emotional abuse and if it is what can I do about it?,Stress
28179,"I also get really painful cramps/periods every month. I do not share this with the people I work with because I do not want to ""complain"" nor do I think it is any of their business!

That is an understatement he has over 60 empty beverage containers on his coffee table he has over 30 fruit flies flying around and the odour is disgusting.

28182,And I’m scared all the time. I get flashbacks from ptsd at home and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories. And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating. I’m sorry. I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,Stress
28186,I’m very concerned that I might never be able to put a condom on last in bed or satisfy a woman with my penis. The girl was very satisfied and even exhausted and she said that it was the most times she cums in one night and that the previous guys just stuck it in and thrusted ( which I’m secretly jealous honestly since I’m concerned that I might not be able to stick it in right now). she keeps texting me now about meeting up again. She said I’m great with my hands and I’m a great kisser but she kept silent about my penis which I was apparently very bed using it. I kept my cool throughout the night and laughed it off and she was very cool and said that she was expecting it but I’m very concerned that I might have a deformity or something.,Stress

I have younger family members i am trying to protect so i feel alot of weight on my shoulders when i am having a bad PTSD episode around my abuser and my younger family members.",Stress
28191,Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21. I never realised how much an effect these events had on me. There is another woman that I like (F32). She is very intelligent and we talk all the time. The problem is that I am married even though my marriage is awful.,Stress

Well after major issues with the bf we finally were able to get rid of him.,Stress
28194,I cant function just having a hostile room mate not needing to work there's literally no way I can function homeless. I'm barely keeping myself from suicide at this point. I cant go into a residential care facility because they mistreat and abuse people extremely often in the united states and I cant handle further abuse or I'll end up killing myself. Any ideas on what to do? thanks.,Stress
28196,I described my symptoms to friends and they would say its normal or that they have thoughts of their own and that it's all in my head. But I knew this wasn't normal I'm an optimistic person and I'm not afraid of people I actually like socializing and meeting people but my anxiety gets in the way and my fear of judgment.. but even I knew that I wasn't nervous but my body was reacting in a way... idk how to describe it. I just wished that I could go for drinks with my girls and when guys came over I wouldnt over analyze and get nervous... and start twitching because of all the rush of blood to my face... I dealt with this for years and was going to just live like this... but then I went to a bar to meet up with my girlfriends but arrived late. Once in the bar I saw a group of guys sitting with them.,Stress
28197,The idea of what ISPs can do once the lack rules are truly active have made me feel sick to my stomach. I can't sleep and it is affecting my school life. I can't afford to pay ransom to the Corporate Fascist Thugs who wish to cableize the internet and I can't stand the idea of the internet becoming like that of China and North Korea. We are still fighting but I'm still paranoid and every day that gets closer to April 23rd makes me feel more infuriated and panicky. I feel under attack and very life about to be destroyed.,Stress
28199,Now the past week anxiety has hit harder than it's ever hit before. I'm checking snapchat scores social media activitiy last active etc which i know is already grounds for unhealthy relationships. The problem is when we were together and whilst we were texting chat its absolutely perfect until the past week. The texts are shorter my messages are being ignored (she's online but not reading my message) for hours on end there's no good night / good morning message it's all very limited and short. I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility in that 'yes everything is fine i don't need to be in constant communication with you' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.,Stress
28202,It seemed like there was no recognition of my emotional state and like he just wanted me to be quiet. That scares me. He claims he was trying to help comfort me but I really am having trouble believing that. This is the second time something like this has happened. The first time was when we were arguing and it was getting really heated.,Stress
28206,I told him I’m not using that on my makeup and my contacts stuff! I’m crying and yelling and he is yelling at me and shoving a broom in my face and I just tell him I’m taking all my stuff out of the bathroom so now it’s on the shelves that I just cleared off. So >now the only thing of mine in the bathroom is my toothbrush and tooth paste. &nbsp; >I can’t live like this.I can’t be here anymore.,Stress
28207,So my question is how worried should I be about this? Is it likely that this guy will come look for me or cause problems in the future? Or am I overreacting? What would you do if you were in my shoes? Thanks!,Stress
28208,I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault. I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking. This must mean that I am truly worthless and a waste of life. I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this because I deserve this hard life. Has anyone experienced horrible burn out because of PTSD/OCD?,Stress
28215,I was feeling sick I had work to do I was tired and all I could do was shout that I didn't want to be so close to the next step and get slingshotted back because of something I didn't know was coming. I know it's my fault. I know I should've been more careful been more prepared. But I can't do this. My boyfriend has been begging me to keep the baby and it makes me feel torn.,Stress
28217,My husband has poor impulse control (his words) especially when he gets angry or frustrated. I've noticed he often will take out frustration on the dog (he's a rescue who is legitimately hard to manage). He's never hit me or hit the dog but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline. For example the other day the dog was having a lot of anxiety and being bad and barking in the car at every dog we passed. When we arrived home my partner got out of the car and pulled the dogs leash so hard that he fell out the door into his back.,Stress
28218,I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own that I can’t tell anyone about. I hate going throw this on my own not that my family don’t try to support me I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps. Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go. So It’s been largely untreated not throw lack of trying. I can’t see my condition changing.,Stress
28219,After I took care of healing my self my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman. He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am I was already 13 years younger than him and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past. I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship. It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency. I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.,Stress

He’s having a really rough time with missing all of the milestones of babies first year and is depressed often... when he’s sad he gets angry.,Stress
28230,I just never had proper doctors who could diagnose me. There's a very long story there. I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life.

I'm scared and so .... almost annoyed of dealing with this he was served a protective order way back in October 2017. Also...how has he repeatedly had so much success with the police? It honestly baffles me which is why I wonder whether he's paying them off (he told me he'd done this while we were together although that could've been a fear tactic).,Stress
28241,But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't.

28267,I loved that man so much and tried my best to make it work. But I have limits. And when he was not thinking twice about getting alcohol while we didn’t have even enough money left for milk for our baby that was my limit. We had .51 cents in our account and he found that acceptable? !,Stress

28273,I find myself curious if any of you have experienced a partner who with holds sex and affection as part of their abuse pattern. I mostly read about men who force or otherwise guilt/manipulate their partners to have sex. My situation is different. My husband refuses to touch me. If I try to initiate sex which I have done many times in the past he will flat out push me away.,Stress
28274,The problem is that she won't accept the fact that I want to break up. She says I'm not giving a good enough reason. And she wants me to keep talking to her because I'm her only good friend that she can talk to and thinks she can win me back. I'm a pretty nice guy and I feel bad for her because I know she struggles with making friends and I feel like an ass if I just leave her.

28284,If you haven't outgrown that by your early 20s I think there's possibly a problem.

28285,Hello r/ptsd. I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15.

This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety as well as very severe panic attacks. After talking to my psychiatrist and a therapist they diagnosed me.,Stress
28286,I didn't tell anyone not even my family. I felt I had to protect them; They were already insolved with CPS (Trust me though they're awesome) and I knew if i brought abuse into our case I would inevitably send them down an unnecessary path. Social workers don't blame the abuser they jump to the conclusion of negligent parents; Parents who were irresponsible enough to not know this was going on. They didn't know they didnt know because they couldn't know. I went out for a few hours and they assumed I was hanging out with my friends at least that's what I planned to do; They assumed I went to school and got an education not beatings when the teacher was out of the room.,Stress

28290,I can't stop feeling miserable. It's not even because my ex is going crazy because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life. I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want. I don't even know what he was referring to but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case. I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought and I must be as crazy as I now feel.,Stress
28295,It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers) and she had honestly stopped being helpful. Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over when I told her these solutions either didn't work or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it rather than with an intended destination/goal for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander without something to focus on something to distract myself it starts tearing itself apart ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past ways I've failed or fallen short and I end up worse off than when I started. So I eventually stopped going. And then eventually stopped taking my meds mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil then losing water due to burst pipes then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.,Stress

She makes a passing comment that she would likely be more comfortable at home eating food.

I mentioned I was blocking the signs she asked why and I said well I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative they are funny and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"" walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative.

28308,For context I'm working through my last year of grad school living alone currently with not many strong friendships in the area and my Dad has been dying of cancer since September so it's a stressful and lonely time. At first I was quite excited about getting married. But for the last 3 months or so all it does is fill me with dread and worry. When I've visited her I've found myself falling into a deep funk.

A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic he loves me to death he tells me how beautiful I am every day he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.

28319,I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (theoretically CPTSD but that's not an official diagnosis so whatever). It's been 3 years since I escaped my abuser who abused me for 3 years as well. However because I was so young (high school/college) people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world. That sucks but it's not as bad as what it does to me. On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.,Stress
28321,He knew about this. He asks me if I want to stop. I'm violently sobbing so yes of course I want to stop. He holds me for a couple of minutes. And then he starts talking about T again even though we'd broken up the sexual arrangement months ago.,Stress
28323,I keep getting sudden very short panic attacks. Or anxiety attacks. I'm not sure if I feel fear I don't even know what the feeling is because I forget everything short term afterwards. They last a presumably short amount time and is the worst feeling imaginable to me. Some random thought I can never remember triggers it (it's definitely something that repeats though it's a familiar feeling afterwards).,Stress

And if she made snack she would have been right in front of me because we were in a very small kitchen. And if I were ""there"" I definetly would have known.

28335,I wanted to plant a new chapter in my new city but haven't had time to devote to making it happen yet. I feel like I was the only one taking it seriously and it's dying a slow death. My problem is that one of the acquaintances is giving me a lot of power play-type problems. For example I'll request *four times* in three different mediums we use to email contributions to an end-of-year favorites list and rather than do that she put hers on a share drive and told others to do the same in spite of my multiple requests to email me instead for better ease of sharing. Emails are met with snarky responses or half-measures which mean I still have to chase down.,Stress

And the next page There’s an outline of a human body. I had to put each color(emotion) where I feel it on my body. I’m slightly annoyed because before all of this she’s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much and now I feel like she’s being demeaning? Should I just see where this takes me or let her know that this feels slow and pointless at my appointment next week ?,Stress
28339,But I have something I think is important enough to at least be worth your time. I’m getting the word out about my wife’s surgery fund. She just got the message back today from her workplace denying her disability for her surgery. 😦 Long story short this was devastating for us we are both pretty frugal people that try to save our money but sadly (at 20 and 19) we haven’t had much time outside of home to amass enough savings. This surgery is a catch 22 however as if she doesn’t get it she will have a 75-80% chance of becoming either wheelchair bound or if she’s luck just unable to ever walk up or down stairs.,Stress

I've suggested taking time to ourselves so that he could think things through taking a break talking about it meeting up (we really only can see each other on the weekends due to classes) etc. Still the short responses. He's started to not respond to me; we talk through an app that shows when the other has read the message. I know his class schedule so I know when we can answer back (he checks his phone often).,Stress
28342,Usually after each session I get a headache also. I can't tell if i'm becoming worse because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now. The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious. Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd. One session made the left side of my face numb.,Stress
28346,I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that. I went inside and sat in the bathroom with the lights off.

He came into the office all furious.,Stress
28347,I was working on this so hard and spent all of my money... and I just failed my driving test. Now the idea of retaking it gives me a panic attack. I started learning how to drive 4 years ago and it was okay until I got this driving instructor. 90% of the time when I should be learning he would be lookig on his phone and he would never point out any problems so I felt rather confident to finally try and get my license. In my country you first have to pass the test with your instructor and just then in an official institution.,Stress
28348,I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened. I'm on busphar celexa and atomoxetine and I've been on them longer than the hallucinations and such. I don't know what to do. I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills. I don't know what to do.,Stress
28349,She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying “If this is about my phone I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist and I do not care that this is during work I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work and I may not be entirely right but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling. I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling but it didn’t go so well since she felt like I was being rude so while I am open to trying again I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved? Thank you for reading and I appreciate any and all responses.,Stress
28351,I can't afford a treadmill and I'm not a big fan of gyms (plus there's none really nearby) so I'm trying to use really the one option available: going outside. This is a real problem for me and my anxiety. I feel like a gasping hippopotamus when I try running and am too embarrassed to let anyone see me like that so every time I see a car or person I stop running and immediately go back home. I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run but there are like always people around and it drives me insane. I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).,Stress
28352,I’m really tired. It seems like the moment that I’m starting to recover or I’m starting to get some sort of progress. I get triggered and I have to start all over again.

Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"". I was so upset the entire day. I had told my mom about it and she had told me that what I didn't realize was that none of them were really my close friends since people that are actually friends don't flake out like that plus none of them have ever come over to my place or vice versa or done anything more than hang out every now and then.",Stress

28360,I don't think I have the means of moving out. I got my review in Dec. and I was supposed to get a raise if I did well but they gave me a bonus instead and I know I should be grateful I got anything but it wasn't what I needed and I can't get another job at the moment nothing in the area is hiring for more than what I make at the moment. But I don't know what to do with my family. Just this morning I heard my sister telling my parents they should like her more because she is the winner and I am not.

28361,I can't even talk about the day she left me because it was so traumatic. I can't even admit it to myself. It was awful beyond words and I can't tell anyone.

It's a $100 fine if I can't figure out what to do with it so that's just compounding on the already existing stress. I have $3 to my name right now I luckily get paid Friday so I will be able to pay for my car but I'm still left with only $100 for 2 weeks and I have to figure out how to pay for my textbook for my night class.

28366,I didn't even realize I was doing it until I felt the coldness on the skin of my temple. I thought I would feel fear but all I felt was relief and how easy it would have been to end my overthinking torturing anxiety brain. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression officially at 12. I have severe insomnia and crippling anxiety constantly which leaves me to overwhelming dark depression. I think about everything I've said and done and it feels like fight of flight all the time.,Stress
28367,Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work). Is this something a service dog would be helpful for? Or does it have to be a lot worse than that? Sorry if it's a weird question it's just something I've been thinking about.,Stress
28368,My question: how do I heal from this? As much as I wish there were a way to go back and fix my relationship with her she deserves to heal from the damage I've done and I have no right to ask for anything and so I won't. Lessons I've taken away: + I will **NEVER** do anything like this again. Too much pain for someone you love and it's very hard to reconcile internally.,Stress
28369,Given the diagnosis she refuses to take her prescribed medicine which is a cause for concern to me as when she is on a low she tends to be very apathetic and rude in responses to conversation or ideas of things we can do. We live together in a house with two other people. We have our own space but the common area is shared. She has expressed that she doesn't like the living situation but the fact that it is cheap and we are all locked into a lease has prevented me from making any changes. After our lease is up I want to look for a place that the two of us both like but I am afraid it may be all for nothing.,Stress

28406,I'm upset and the fact that I don't know whether I should be upset is making me more upset.

If this really is an absurd thing to worry about sorry for making you read through this thesis but please do let me know because I'm just really confused and sad.

28409,Hello everyone. I am wondering what experiences people have with using Mirtazapine as their main antidepressant for depressive and anxious symptoms (low energy heavy feeling irritability concentration problems insomnia inability to complete mundane everyday tasks social anxiety fear of embarrassment worry or overthinking about socialization etc)? I am in therapy using a mixed method approach so suggestions of therapy aren't relevant. I have just begun proper psychotherapy and I am looking for something to help me when dealing with reality outside the therapist office. My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.,Stress

Over the years I have always known that his parents don't absolutely love me but I didn't realize that they actually dislike me until this time I visited them. His dad is a difficult person to begin with which is well known by everyone and he kept making little jabs at me and insulting me. For example he asked if I am a citizen and how long I have been one I mentioned that I have never watched Harry Potter and he ""jokingly"" asked me if I was busy clubbing and talking to boys and doubted my upbringing and when I was using my bfs phone he asked me why I am using it and if I am reading his texts.

28474,His refusal to admit to anything though has me worried this is part of ongoing deception/cheating. When he completely denies knowing anything about it I just don't know what I can do with that. It feels like my options are to get over it/give him the benefit of the infinitesimal doubt or leave him over the inferred deception. I guess I have mostly just let it go but then every so often I remember about it and can't help but wonder am I a colossal idiot is he taking me for a ride? **Tl;dr** Found an okcupid profile for my husband he denies knowing anything about it,Stress

On top of this there is no fucking way I can go back to my hometown. The family I have there will be so embarrassed and let down.

Dissociative symptoms are a significant problem at this time. Focusing on a movie tv show video game book even a short song can be impossible at times. The interest in 'quick tips' on how to manage those overwhelming emotions is an attempt to make it feasible to read a fre books I'm hoping might help (Pete walker's CPTSD and James Chu's Rebuilding shattered lives MacKenzie's Psychopath free).,Stress
28492,He has done it to lots of people and says every night that he is going to kill himself but then never does anything. Not even self harm. This also affects my family life as I come home everyday feeling stressed and this causes conflict in my family. (I still live with my mum and she works hard and travels a lot so she is also stressed) so I try to bottle it in to not give her more stress but then it eventually comes out in the form of arguments because we both try to bottle in our emotions so we end up falling out and both feeling very upset. Please can someone help me find a way to cope with all of this it would mean a lot to me.,Stress
28493,I remember what it felt like to not be anxious one on medicine. none of the other ones I've been put on take any of the edge off.

She has been gone through it and knows how it feels to be hurt and lied too and said she will never do it to anyone as she’s been through it and is the type of person that wears her heart on her sleeve. I completely trust my husband but this is harder then I thought. Hard because I see her messaging him everyday day as soon as she wakes up and stays talking to him on the phone too. Hard because they still want to see each other.,Stress

Recruiters have poached a few folks from her work and I guess she was next on the list.,Stress

I felt so awful. We were close but I knew her past was traumatic and rarely pried.,Stress

I quickly got up to put my plate on the dumbwaiter and left the dining hall and it subsided fairly quickly I didn't really think much of it.

She ends up saying no almost all of the time and I'm getting to where I don't even ask because I feel bad that she has to say no. And this leads to me feeling lonely and unwanted. The part of this that doesn't feel fair is that she can ask to do something with me at anytime and I basically drop everything to go do whatever she wants. I say yes to literally every thing she asks because I just cant help myself not to.,Stress
28525,But I mean does it really matter? I didn't know that either but I still felt the same. And he was well aware of what I was going through as much as he could have.

He's the only one that can get me to that point of anger where I start sweating and shaking.

I like the warm weather and whatnot but there’s too much activity going on since people enjoy going out. I don’t blame them.,Stress
28537,Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my main account. For some background 30 yo male diagnosed with GAD depression and PTSD. Otherwise healthy but recently my anxiety has been getting worse and showing itself in the most fucking frustrating way. I'm about a year and a half out of an extremely toxic and abusive relationship. I don't want to go into the details at this point but that relationship shattered my trust in people and frankly myself.,Stress
28539,Why did I open my mouth I should’ve just said “I’m fine” ~ I don’t need help Or maybe I do,Stress
28541,Or is that unnecessary? Also is there another way? I really don't want to talk about what happened. But I really want the nightmares to go away. Sorry if this sounds weird I am really really fucking tired...,Stress
28544,"Dear reddit For what I am about to tell you today is not a rant from a ""man"" but a voice of a concerned human being who happens to be male. Victims of domestic violence who are men are being laughed at and not taken seriously in today's society. It seems the society has made up their mind that men could not be victims of female violence because the male is ""much bigger"" therefore the male has some kind of ""agenda"" against the female. I was punched and slapped in the face two weeks ago by my wife who is 5'2 103lbs.",Stress

28546,Some monsters are real. I was abused by some as a kid and I was recently reminded that they are still out there. I sometimes manage to find myself in reddit threads with discussions about pedophilia. It bothers me to see people defending pedophila and I often feel the need to respond. I think it seemed a safe way to vent anger at surrogates for my abusers and I think I wanted a chance to say what I never had the chance to say as an abused kid.,Stress

28548,I met my current boyfriend (42M) let’s call him V back in November. Things were fine there were no red flags. We dated about a month before one day I went to warm up his coffee for him and he started screaming at me for doing it wrong and to never do it again. I have PTSD from being raped and abused and I get uncomfortable when guys yell in the vicinity of me when they yell at me it’s debilitating. He knew this as I make it very clear to potential significant others.,Stress
28549,My youngest who was 6 at the time had what seemed to be a bladder infection or UTI (urinary tract infection). She was literally peeing every five minutes. Since the doctors office was closed I took her to the emergency room. Little did I know my entire world was about to come crashing down. The nurses got us back to a room and once they were done checking her out and had her urine to test we had to wait for the doctor.,Stress
28550,I´m stressing this entire fall break I´ve been learning for 5 days for about 8-10 hours a day and I haven´t finished nothing even after making a schedule (breaks every 45 minutes dedicating one day to one thing). When I feel stressed I feel like I´m about to throw up (or I´m about to cry) and I get anxious to the point of total mental breakdown. I have ADHD and stress gets to me really easily because I can´t keep my attention in place. Any ideas on what to do in this situation? PS: I am 50/50 INFP/INTP-T (50/50 dominant and inferior functions) that might have something to do with it but I´m not quite sure about it.,Stress

28552,Public speaking in class frequently reduced me to tears in front of the class and I could think of nothing else for weeks from the moment it was assigned. Even listening to other people having a conversation is tiring to me even if I'm not an active participant. As a kid I never wanted to have friends over or go to their houses because a full day of school and being around so many people was exhausting and that is also true today at work - I just want to go home and be by myself. When I say something stupid or awkward I think about it for weeks and I still berate myself for things that happened in interactions with people ten years ago. Does any of this ring true with those of you with diagnosed SD?,Stress
28553,Her parents didn't know about me at this point. I kept this bottled in for a long time but exploded and was ready to break up with her over it but she said she would stop being in touch with him. She claims he has mental issues and had threatened numerous times to commit suicide. If I take her at her word there was no sexual contact between them after we started dating. This contributed to me not trusting her.,Stress
28554,He came after me a few times so I got away and called cops. He was arrested restraining order in place and he also had unregistered gun and no licence for them so he may be in trouble for that also.

When my husband saw me he started screaming and snatched the knife away from me and said I am trying to get him into trouble by committing suicide. He kicked me and spat on me. I kept on try to explain to him that I can't take him blaming me for everything and he believes everything he says so hard that every works out of my mouth is a lie. I tried telling him I am trying to fix myself.,Stress
28559,Broken bones concussion. He broke my glasses in half destroyed my TV and dvd player. He tore my clothes off but luckily didn't rape me.

I don't know maybe I'm making a big deal for nothing and my anxiety is getting to me.

28565,I blame myself. Almost all the time. Especially when I feel bad I see the uncomfortable feelings as wrong in the first place and that it's my fault that I feel bad. This makes me feel worse. When I feel worse because I hate myself I hate myself for hating myself for feeling bad.,Stress

She's well-connected at my workplace so gets lots of support from her ""friends"" who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her ""version"" of situations. This is problematic because she also needs disciplinary action because of bullying behavior toward other staff customers and myself but any movement toward that leads to a tantrum. She presents herself as friendly and sympathetic - often the ""victim"" of the situation - so people believe her. I suffer from anxiety low self-esteem and depression so this is a nightmare for me.",Stress
28663,It's important that people know this when they claim platitudes about 'getting support' and 'healing' that require a stable home friends family or even relationships. I spent all of that time trying to get to this point by myself just so some selfish POS could slap me down again. I hate this. I posted this on twitter because I couldn't think and I just wanted to share something even anonymously of course I got nothing. It's hard to admit sometimes until you're desperate but I wanted someone to care.,Stress
28667,Again I worry they'll say that if I'm sexually active I should be able to do this just fine. -Could I get them to only not leave the room or open the door where someone walking by could see me? -Could I ask them to tell me everything as they're doing it? So I'm somewhat prepared for everything? -Could I get them to stop if I need it?,Stress
28668,He would call me by the name peepee until I was 21. I asked him to stop but he just yells at me. I wish he would die or never talk to me. He also forces me to take medication because I got mad at him because of this. He will just scream at me and threaten to call the police to throw me on the street or something.,Stress
28670,I'm sure that there are many people worse off than me in this kind of situation but I just can't stand this feeling anymore. I just want someone to choose me for once instead of just being stuck with me. Unfortunately I have no idea how this could happen. - TL;DR I don't want to feel lonely anymore but I have no idea how to fix myself.,Stress
28673,But if I want to be successful at networking and forming close friendships/relationships I need to get rid of this phobia somehow. In some ways my fear is interfering with not just my social life but my academics as well. I earn high grades but if I want to snatch opportunities outside of the classroom I need to suck it up and try to tolerate group work with my classmates more. I opened up to a therapist about this but before we could actually discuss ways on how to combat the problem she ended up leaving. How does one go about becoming more comfortable around men?,Stress
28675,I would appreciate any insight from other ppl with ptsd and flashbacks. My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened. It is heartbreaking to see and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks? And what kind of things would be most helpful for your partner to do to help you back up to the present?,Stress
28677,"My sister is a shift worker - works around the clock at ridiculous times. I asked her (before I moved in) if she could sometimes pick me up from work if I worked late and if she could help me with my driving - she said yes. I've now asked a her a few times if we could drive somewhere she has said: ""no"" ""just because"" and ""I'm sick and tired"". She's lazy and selfish. I've asked her once if she could pick me up from work (as my dad was unavailable) knowing for a fact she's not working and I get a response saying ""I'll pick you up at the bus stop down the road"" - which doesn't help me at all.",Stress
28678,My father is an alcoholic and he has been for about 34 years. My mom has had to deal with this the entire time and lately he has been having parties at their house and drinking up until 3-4am almost every weekend. He drinks everyday and my mother usually comes to me to vent about it. I’ve honestly lost my patience because I feel she should do something about it but she won’t. She’s afraid to leave because he says he’ll accuse her of abandoning the home.,Stress
28679,I have no assets to sell outside of a broken android phone and have no family to ask for help from. I am about $150 short right now and have had to skip appointments to save money. My landlord has a quick temper and is not often understanding of late payments. I am on a month-to-month lease and am very afraid that I will lose my apartment. I have work prospects that should become viable within the next couple of weeks but I really need help to get to that point.,Stress
28682,Hardly any jobs there too. So maybe even the next town over is the only place age could find a job. I have a car not very reliable car at that. So she has a place to stay until she gets on her feet but no transportation. No licence to trek that 20 miles back and forth up and down the mountain even if she did get a job.,Stress
28684,I don't know why because it didn't bother me before I actually saw it on a screen but I am absolutely crushed. I've asked him to hide it from me from now on and expressed how hurt it was but I went to use his gaming system a couple of days ago and saw he was still looking it up regularly (I guess he thought I wouldn't use it - I had gone to look up something and all the searches popped up in the Bing bar). I never felt attractive to him and I know that's my own fault and insecurity and not his problem to fix. I know rationally that men like variety. But I haven't sent him nudes in probably two months now.,Stress
28685,"During my break at work today a little over two hours ago I was enjoying a cup of grape juice. At one moment I started drinking it too fast and choked and coughed for a few moments. Then i was constantly burping and had the taste of grape juice in my mouth for the next hour after that. Lol. But thanks to my anxiety I have managed to convince myself juice got in my lungs and I'm gonna get ""Dry/Secondary Drowning""...",Stress
28687,I am constantly afraid of when it's going to happen next and I'm so scared I'm going to have some embarrassing reaction to it. It happened today and I was able to play it cool for about 5 minutes and then I went on my lunch and cried my eyes out in my car. I've been having really bad flashbacks all afternoon and night. I really wish it didn't get to me like this. My day was seriously ruined by a harmless prank.,Stress
28688, I am a 30 year old male with a 5 lb dog recently homeless in Washington state. My dog is the last remaining thing from when life was normal and I refuse to get ride of her after being my companion for 6 years. Reason for my homeless car broke had to work fast food because it was close to home. I was assigned less hours than the high schoolers I worked with (3-4 hour shifts)I was unable to maintain the apartment. I do not have any drug abuse problems or alcohol.,Stress
28691,Obviously they don't care but to me it means everything. I've always been like this. My dream one day is just to magically wake up with this skill.. if only like worked like that.. Does anyone have any tips on how to calm my anxiety down and not let it overpower me? Anything would be greatly appreciated.,Stress
28693,I know the best thing for me is to find a new job but I've been applying for quite awhile now with no luck and I really don't want to move to another job that I don't enjoy and will make me feel the exact same way. I sort of think I have an idea of what I want to do but I have no idea how to make it happen while still paying my bills so I've been applying to anything that seems like it might be relevant to me but I'm not sure the right way to go about getting into a field I don't have a degree in. Because of this I feel trapped in my job right now and it gets so bad some days where I feel like just walking out and quitting or just not going in ever again. I'm rambling at this point does anyone else deal with a job that makes them completely miserable? How do you deal with it?,Stress
28694,I need to borrow $60 I was in the hospital earlier this week and missed a shift so I'm going to be short my next check and I'm already down to only $20. I can pay back $85 by december 14th &#x200B; I've paid back $100 in here before and I've also posted to /r/borrow already. If you can help I'd really appreciate it I can provide documentation of being in the hospital and my job,Stress
28697,The problem occurs when he returns to visit me for 1-2 weeks. When he's back at his girlfriend's house he doesn't really have much to do. So he spends a lot of time gambling. That in itself is a gigantic problem since we have almost no money. He is gambling money that he **can't afford to lose**.,Stress
28700,I paid off some of my credit card debt a couple days ago but my company also charged me on their automatic pay system. I barely had enough this paycheck to cover just the single payment; when this extra payment processes it's going to cost me an overdraft fee. I am in no position to let that happen and so I need money to cover for it as well as cover for my student loan payment which also hasn't processed yet. I need somewhere around $50 to completely clear me out of any sort of financial trouble. I can use Paypal or Google Wallet whichever works best.,Stress
28702,I was completely on my own by 14. When she felt the cuts on my wrists in the dark on night she asked if I was cutting ? I said no and she never said anything again. I could go on and on. I think she truly believes that because I am an adult now that all the screw ups all the pain I have been through is my own fault.,Stress
28703,i probably havesevere gad. at least i think i do. i need to get help because im avoiding anything i can. school starts again in a few weeks and im an upcoming sophmore. i want to stop skipping lunch because all of the people in there make me anxious and i cant bring myself to look up i stare at the ground 99% of the time whenever i walk through the halls because i cant stand to make eye contact.,Stress
28707,How did you come up with it? I've wanted to kill myself almost everyday for 17 years. I'm done talking to therapists and asking friends for help. Right now I see two options: commit suicide or develop an emergency self-care plan for when I'm feeling this way so I'll be okay until I feel safe again. Unfortunately my meds only impact anxiety (and only sometimes) not depression or PTSD.,Stress
28708,I'm afraid that maybe they aren't true and I'm demonizing him in my memory because having a villain that did horrible things to me is just easier to digest than the complicated truth. The worst thing is I can't bring myself to talk to anybody. I always felt like I wasn't bad enough to need a doctor. I felt like I could get through it on my own. Even now its hard for me to open up to my fiance about these things.,Stress
28709,She gives me something weaker that I know will NOT work. I've been on so many meds I feel like I'm at the point where I know what will work and what won't and she might as well written me a script for a sugar pill. This is what she decides to do after I tell her how anxious I am how a heavy duty benzo isn't working and how I'm near the brink of ending my life due to fear and anxiety and have no options left. Do I blame her for being cautious? No.,Stress
28710,I realized he is not very nice or smart and totally unwilling to cooperate/compromise. I wanted to leave but he had spent all my money (promising to give it back haha) and I had nowhere to go. I had the baby (he went out to eat with his mother while I was in unmedicated labor). Basically I made one stupid mistake after another and let him walk all over me and it doesn't stop there. I took care of the baby all by myself for 6 months.,Stress
28711,I tried to break up with him at the end of the semester the day he was supposed to leave but he intentionally missed his flight to stay talking to me and talk me into staying with him. I don't know what to do. Mostly I am scared that I will deal some kind of huge blow to his mental health and am just very scared of the repurcussions. I have friends apart from him I feel like I can fall back on but I feel like a monster for confirming his fear of abandonment. I also feel conflicted because he is incredibly kind and generous and affectionate,Stress
28716,"I'm new to this so please forgive me. I'm not very good at expressing my emotions. I need advice/help. I was molested multiple times by my biological dad when I was 5 up until middle school (so like 10 yrs old). After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",Stress
28717,He denied it and ever since then I think everyone is out to get me and that nothing ever happened and I'm just insane. I always doubt myself and it's hard to hang out with anyone because I think they all have some agenda toward me. I know logically nothing happened but when I get home I have to always check my body for bruises or anything suspicious. Then I feel shameful and want to self harm/die when I realize I'm accusing someone innocent of something so terrible and then my mind tells me nothing ever happened and I'm just nuts. It doesn't help that my family doesn't understand me and minimalizes all of my problems.,Stress
28721,I have been living in <location> at a homeless shelter run by the Salvation Army since the beginning of February (I know it hasn't been that long but still) and I started a new job a month or so later around the beginning of March. I don't know if my boss did a google search of the address I have on record or maybe drove past it one day but I overheard him talking to another one of the staff about how 'the homeless population here in Toronto is getting pretty bad and how there might be a lot once the weather improves because of the people trying to leave the USA because of Trump' And since I heard this conversation I went from having 3 shifts of 4 hours per week (12 hours per week) down to this week I have 1 shift that's only 3 hours and he's blaming how our sales are really slow which they are down by an average of 4% compared to last year according to the reports that are printed automatically each day. It also doesn't help that since I started a month ago we had 11 employees and as of this morning we now have 16. Tell me why the hell if business is so slow why did we increase the number of staff by almost 50%?,Stress
28725,She also told me that I was an idiot for wasting my life or attempting to end it anyways. I came out of that appointment in tears. That was a horrible day and I still think about it. It made me feel like I had nothing to complain about. Its only taken me until the last couple of weeks to finally accept that I did nothing wrong.,Stress
28727,Also as of right now the 2017 team is on their trek to Alaska. Because of this I'm limited on what I can do to raise money since the main focus is on them. In the meantime all I can do is ask for donations. I was hoping Reddit could help me out with this. If anyone wants to donate to me personally here's the link to do so along with my reason for riding: <url>,Stress
28728,Am I being way overdramatic? Hope I provided enough information. I truly tried not to sound angry or overly upset. - **tl;dr**: My mother has hit me quite a few times put my clothes in trash bags when I don't clean them on time won't let me lock my door and has threatened to take away the car I drive that they paid for (and therefore job and access to classes).,Stress
28729,I’m high risk for PPD seeing as I have preexisting BPD and anxiety and going back into working immediately after giving birth would most likely be very damaging. Not to mention I haven’t had the easiest pregnancy having had multiple emergency room stays and having been hospitalized. My goal is to have at least the required time to recover without having to put myself in debt. Even $5 is a huge help because that's $5 less that we'll have to borrow to cover our bills while I'm not working. <url>,Stress
28730,I didn’t realize before my brother had kids just how high pitch they can get. I don’t have kids nor do I want them. I’m expected to be around them 24/7 and when they’re all losing their shit all I want to do is crawl into a hole and hide away. I’m constantly on edge because I’m constantly being startled or scared there’s a lot of yelling and screaming and crying and it’s only the end of day 3 of a two week vacation. Sorry for the long post I don’t have anyone to talk to about this until January when I see my therapist next.,Stress

28736,We’re still behind on bills but we will catch up now we’re finally in cheaper accommodation. I’ve tried everything I can to earn some form of income but unfortunately I’ve not been able to land a part time job and I’ve been deemed ineligible for any welfare or study assistance. We have one last major hurdle. My tuition fees for my final semester are overdue but I’ve been given an extension until the 24th of August and unfortunately we’re still short and running out of time. As a last resort I’ve set up a GoFundMe.,Stress
28738,I am constantly freaking out and unable to see friends that don't know about my diagnosis or make the friends that do feel very uncomfortable. I feel guilty because I feel as if I brought this all on myself because if I hadn't of taunted my father he would not have attacked me. I know rationally this is not true but I cannot shake the feeling. Has anyone else experienced this and is willing to give advice. The guilt is eating me up.,Stress
28740,After burning out I fumbled through a tough 8-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps. I then went back to college and obtained an Associates Degree with a 4.0 GPA before burning out just shy of a Bachelors. Following that by leveraging my limited IT experience from the Marine Corps I landed a job averaging $110k annually with a Fortune 500 company. Along the way I got married and my wife and I now have four brilliant children. Three years since burning up (again) and walking away from the $110k job life continues to go completely down hill.,Stress
28741,Background: This time last year I lost my job got evicted and my car broke down all in the same month. Cut to today and I found out my site is closing and we'll all soon be out of the job. I just feel like a big ball of anxiety and like I can't quite turn my brain off. It's like the world beneath my feet is off and I'm doing everything I can not to cry. Sorry for the brick of text.,Stress
28743,I just got a small job offer from a friend of mine who works prepping dessert plates at a restaurant and well I agreed to try it out but I feel so anxious. This happens every time I look for jobs and they actually want to hear of me. I don’t know why the whole process just feels like my embarrassment on display and I’m afraid to commit myself to working part time due to this. It’s nothing hard yet I feel so ashamed when I tell my family and partner that I didn’t simply like the job or feel like it’s demanding too much of me atm. It’s like getting a job takes so much from me atleast socially.,Stress
28744,Hello all I am about to be laid off. I am currently on a prepaid cell phone plan. I use this basic smartphone for all extra side money and internet. I can barely pay the bill this month but the device is not working well at all as it is old and I spilled a good amount of water on it last night during dinner.,Stress
28747,I've been thinking about this for weeks and have talked about it with her on numeral occasions and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I just don't know what to feel right now and I'm an emotional wreck. Am I overthinking or it are these reasonable things to worry about? - **tl;dr**: worried what people will say about my girlfriend and I.,Stress
28749,I called my boyfriend and I just ranted at him. He was shocked. I've never spoken like that about anyone. I wasn't even thinking about what was coming out of my mouth and I just called her all these names and said all these horrible things about her when she isn't a bad person! How the hell do I get over this?,Stress
28750,I'm so scared I actually don't want to lose him. I love him. I love him so much. tl;dr: I've gotten gaslighted in my past relationships and it's caused me to have a lot of self doubt about my thoughts and feelings and question myself constantly. in this case I'm questioning if im actually losing feelings since I'm developing crushes on others.,Stress
28753,I might be homeless soon I have about 500 dollars in my bank account and I NEED to get out of Massachusetts. I am going to be a college drop-out in my 3rd year due to family reason instead of academics. After a lot of research I am contemplating between Wichita Kansas and Columbus Ohio. I really just want a minimum wage job where I can have a bed and private bathroom. Afterward I can get my life together and start taking programming jobs again.,Stress
28760,That was easy I was probably anxious about my health because I lost a very close relative when I was 11. The second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. Checking my records of doctor visits I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness.,Stress
28761,I endured months and months of all types of abuse the final time was when he grabbed an iron gym equipment that you attach to the wall and threatened to hit my pregant stomach with it. After all of this after denying my child saying he wasnt the father after taking everything he had from me i missed an important detail: A witness stood quiet. To this day I think heavily of this and I fear that karma will get them both (heavens forbid) through the child. Please.,Stress
28763,I can't find an affordable place to rent that would fit in with my budget and I have no savings. I've looked up a lot of the shelters around me that give out meals/ have assistance but they all close before I get out of work so I can't even drive over and ask questions. I can't call during work because I work in a very customer-centric work environment. So I guess my questions are: What should I be looking out for when living in my car? How do I go NC with my dad but still keep in contact with my family?,Stress
28765,I'm 29 and I've just committed to moving into a shared apartment in my city centre. I've never lived in a place like this before because it's an en-suite with my own double bedroom and bathroom but the kitchen and lounge is shared with about 15 other 'profressionals' It's right in the centre of a bustling city near all the bars and music venues. I've always lived in the suburbs but I've always felt a bit disconnected from everything because most of my (limited) social life takes place in the city centre. But now I'm scared because I'm such an introvert and there's going to be lots of people around all the time and I'm worried I've made a mistake. Another big worry of mine is that my ex best friend lives just a few streets away from where I will be living and we are going to be sharing the same supermarket etc.,Stress
28766,I grew up my country’s equivalent of the bible belt. My country is well known for being very very progressive in our larger cities and very very conservative in our villages – this is true I think for most countries but the sheer difference between our “levels” is pretty well known. I grew up in an abusive household surrounded by really misogynist men and have experienced trauma on both these fronts. This obviously caused me some mental health issues. I was afraid of and uncomfortable around men for a very long time.,Stress
28768,I've put him up in a motel for a few days bought him a bike and gave him some money but I know I can't afford to have him stay at a motel forever (or even support him like that! ) the money will run out and I just feel sick/stressed/sad because I don't even know what to do at this point or how to help anymore than what I've already done. I work full time and have to suppport myself and I live at home with my mother and she wants absolutely nothing to do with him. He needs help and I just don't what else I can do. Any advice or resources would be much appreciated!,Stress
28770,Two days ago I packed all of my clothes into my car and have started living out of it. I sleep in the parking lot at work work for 8 hours and then spend the day at Starbucks on the internet and charging my electronics. Once Thursday rolls around I will have ~$400 which is not much as far as being able to afford a place to sleep. If I become good at living out of my car over the next few days I may just use some of that money to invest in making it easier for myself. I don't really know why I'm posting this here except that living out of your car is a pretty lonely experience.,Stress
28771,It honestly felt like someone punched a hole right through me. Later in the day I texted her and we talked. I asked her how the trip went. She sounded exited to talk to me and it sounded like it would work out between us. I asked her abut her friend and if anything had happened between them and she said that nothing had happened and that her aunt was with her the whole time.,Stress
28774,Basically I’m going through quite a bit right now. I suffer from anxiety depression probably (low mood irritation poor concentration) and things just haven’t been going that well. My friend who has autism makes off-the-wall jokes about death and killing in general. That bothers me as two of my friends have passed away in their 20s… And I still think about them and try to remember the good times. Suffering from The Doubting Disease has been fun.,Stress
28776,"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was assaulted when I was 18 but to be honest I've never really felt like I had it. I can usually push things down so deeply that I don't feel many repercussions of what I've been through aside from a lot of shame. In the last 4 months though someone who's been on and off harassing me since I was 17 has resurfaced. He was sending me hundreds of texts and calling me saying things varying from ""you're going to marry me and we can have kids and live together forever"" to ""you're a whore and you're a disgusting person and I want to (insert threat) you"". He makes fake accounts and tries to add me or adds my friends accusing them of taking me from him.",Stress
28777,Our family cat Bootsy became very ill and we took her to the vet. We spent what little money we had on diagnostics there and after an ultrasound it was determined she would need surgery immediately or she would likely die. We didn't have the money for surgery but found an organization which would perform the procedure and provide necessary care to help her if we transferred ownership. We gave Bootsy up to have a chance of saving her life. After some weeks of care and a surgery we recently found out Bootsy fully recovered but the organization will not return her to us unless we pay for a portion of the cost of her care approximately $650.,Stress

The total cost is 1150 dollars and to be honest I'm a poor college student. The procedure will be put on a credit card and I probably won't be paying it off for a long time. Blackie has been my cat for the last ten years and without this treatment there is a good chance he will not make it past summer.,Stress
28794,I am not sad I am not depressed I am still a very happy and optimistic person with a great life good friends family job all that. But I am struggling to manage this anxiety because it spills into life. I don't have thoughts I obsess over I don't worry about anything really. It's just the stress I have been through set up my body for this crap response. Besides relaxation meditation and such what can you recommend?,Stress
28796,It was more calm then I had felt in months. But then I remembered scars. That has stopped me since those three days of calm. I only have few scratches and cuts and one glass cut but I easily hide them with a few wristbands and a watch. Thing is everything scars and if I keep going its going to affect me later in life.,Stress
28802,I meant this stuff and I think I still sort of do. The reason I've been so angry recently is just the general stuff with my family but also my dad specifically. He's been awful to me in the past couple of days everything I say or do no matter how good I'm trying to be is bad and horrible and stupid and if I disagree with him even slightly he gets angry. But I think I might deserve it. I feel like a bad person.,Stress
28806,He said that I should have ptsd because the reason I was wrestling my dad for the gun is because Im a sick bastard who wanted to kill him and the rest of my family. I don't know why I made this post. I don't know if I even really got out what I wanted to say. I just feel so alone. Its been almost a year since that day but even today my family some how twisted my actions into thinking im some sort of failed murderer,Stress
28807,I have no one to relate with and if I can't get around it I'll be eventually separated because I can't afford to fail another PFT because of it. I'm not here for sympathy about what lead to my anxiety. I want to put that out there. And I'm not sorry if anyone gets offended by my dark sense of humor. That's the only way I've found temporarily deal with it.,Stress
28809,I just feel so naked and unprotected. WIll this be any different with the therapist? After all I don't even know if I want to go to this therapy session I'm so confused about myself it's unbelievable. Has anyone of you guys ever experienced this self-confusion before and can help me finding myself again? The appointment has not even yet been made and I'm already freakin' out about it I feel kinda like an idiot right now.,Stress
28810,I've had a really turbulent month and unexpected bills and trouble with an old landlord which has resulted in me almost being in minus on my account and almost out of rice to feed myself i moved and got scammed out of my deposit from my landlord which i am still awaiting and had to buy some new things aswell as take care of my sick mate. Would really appreciate any help so i could feed myself the upcoming time not sure if i can offer much in return except my utmost gratitude (Though tell me if you need anything and i might be able to help). This is really a last resort for me no food banks nearby or any family i could get help from unfortunately. Thanks in advance for reading cheers! Location Denmark,Stress
28811,I constantly face so much anxiety in school. It makes me extremely depressed and it’s just hard to cope with. I don’t know if anxiety/depression have anything to do with memory performance but I’ve noticed that I remember a lot less compared to when I wasn’t in a depressed and anxious state. For hours on end I contemplate and procrastinate everyday about my depressing life. It’s just sad.,Stress
28812,I had two friends attempt (no longer friends because one was a narcissist and the other was an abusive borderline) and both those attempts traumatized me. They made me so upset. I also was upset about the fake accusation about talking about rape porn. I keep thinking about my assault. It happened in public at night time and it's almost like I can see how dark it is and how he forced himself upon me.,Stress
28813,I don't know. I keep overthinking everything and I am worrying about what it would be like to be with him for an extended amount of time. What if it is horrible and we end up hating each other? I fear that I cannot deliver what he wants and deserves emotionally and sexually and those fears stunt my ability to love him freely. I am wary of the fact I have no control over the outcome of that.,Stress
28814,I'm exhausted from just continuing to go to work. God I'm so tired... I know I'm so much further than I was a year ago. But it still sucks. But I know I'm getting happier I am happy most days.,Stress
28817,November 8 is the anniversary of when I was kidnapped and raped. The anniversaries are always hard on me and this year is feeling extra hard. On Facebook a lot of my friends are celebrating their own or their kids’ birthdays today their wedding anniversaries sharing memories of the awesome vacations they were on on this day last year etc. I feel weird and alone in my trauma. It’s not that I want anyone to have to join me in misery but I guess I’m wondering if anyone else out there happens to be dealing with this at the same time as me.,Stress
28819,Hi r/domestic violence! You guys were recommended by the super supportive guys over at r/twoXchromosomes where I made this post earlier in the week: <url> (tl;dr: I've been facing a lot of personal strife lately argument on Saturday with my husband resulted in restraining and a hit to the face. We're both military members.) A few things have happened since last Saturday.,Stress
28820,I too am loyal to her. My insecurity came out pretty early in our relationship. I was still getting to know her and there was a lot to figure out. It's normal to be insecure in a new relationship but the problem is that I can't stop being insecure. I feel like my insecurities spiraled out of control and now she is thinking of leaving me.,Stress
28821,I need to start setting some healthy boundaries and cut these people out of my life. I just do not know where to start because they are family but I have three girls that are growing. I cannot have them involved with these monsters. My children will know a different world. Do I tell my father or just fade slowly into the abyss and never look back?,Stress
28823,Every once and a while I will get this over whelming feeling in my head where I feel really out of it and freaked out. I will feel like I haven’t slept in a bit I don’t feel like me. I’m anxious but also tired and I wanna just go take a nap. But my inner self tells me that I am going to have a seizure. I don’t have seizures or anything and I am completely healthy.,Stress
28826,I think about it very often wondering if I should just do it get it over with but something keeps holding me back. I wonder if this was my fault that I would be turned away for not bringing it to their attention earlier if I would be accused of participating I keep wondering if they’ll believe an 18 year old or a 40 year old. Please if anyone who is struggling reads this please don’t let yourself fall into this trap. Don’t keep your mouth closed don’t be polite keep yourself safe no matter what that costs. I wish every day that I had quit that job sooner that the second people warned me that I had had the nerve just to tell another manager how he was acting that I had told anyone how uncomfortable and scared I was.,Stress
28827,At this point I've moved home (living with 4 younger siblings and 2 loud dogs) and I finally started a new job. I'm seeing a new psychologist and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist. My new doctor has seen me twice and already changed my diagnosis I to PTSD which not only fits all of my symptoms but includes some that I thought were just part of my personality. But since hearing this I've really been struggling with accepting the reality that I have to deal with. I have vivid and disturbing nightmares I wake up soaked in sweat freezing and crying.,Stress
28828, **tl;dr**: I've [18 F] been into my friend [18 M] for nearly two years and he's about to go out on a date with my best friend [18 F]. I don't know how to handle my feelings about their developing romantic relationship. Also he's trying to set me up with his best friend [19 M] and I don't know what to do about that. Thanks to anyone who may be able to offer some advice.,Stress
28829,This leads to me not liking the general mood in the classroom which leads to me being un-motivated and demoralised when I'm at school. Every day I try to see if I can pretend to be sick to avoid going to school because I find almost no joy at school which is a shame because of all the schools I have been to over the years i actually enjoy what we do and the teachers are nice. I have no idea why this simple fact is affecting me so much. But I just feel horrible whenever I think about school or the thought of having to go to school. TL;DR: I spent a lot of time with my friends during break and I'm depressed because I have to go back to school with classmates that are very immature.,Stress
28830,Fuck you for getting money through your job while doing literally nothing to help your patients. Fuck you for being an absolutely useless bigot. This town is small and i will suggest everyone I know to never ever go to your damn fucking clinic you dick. &#x200B; Time to get a new doctor and see if I can finally get someone to listen.,Stress
28831,Some times it feels like my dreams will never go away. I have regular dreams about my ex. Usually a few dreams every week. Sometimes the dreams quiet down and some times they occur every night. He was abusive to the point where he tried to kill me while I was laying in bed one night and he was very physically abuse every other day.,Stress
28833,So to start with I have ptsd from years of emotional/mental/verbal abuse and a few years of physical abuse/sexual assault. I have problems because of this obviously. My soon to be MIL just learned that I have PTSD from my fiancé. In order to keep it to something she’d understand because when she thinks one thing it’s too hard to change her mind or get her to understand he changed the story a little before he talked to her as well leaving some stuff out. However he told her about me having been dating someone when I was sexually assaulted and changed the story to say I went over there while dating someone else and it happened.,Stress
28836,It was worse than that I wanted to throw up not because I found the scars disgusting but because the person I loved so so much had done that to herself. This is when she told me more about her situation basically all her issues is beacause of a very unstable family with an alcoholic mentally abusive and neglective father. Her mom is her best friend in the world but she too suffers from depression and anorexia. Her parents had a terrible divorce where she got caught in the middle resulting in her falling deeper into depression and self harm tendencies as well as her mother becoming very anorexic and depressed all the while her father was drinking. She felt she couldn't burden her mother with her issues and instead keep it to herself which she does til today as well.,Stress
28838,When we are at work we joke around but we all do that. I feel so ashamed. I want to hear your opinion on the fact am i to blame? Was it my fault because something like this happened? **tl;dr**: Something delicate happened between me and my collegue,Stress
28839,Original post here: <url> Quick update: my abusive ex who put forward his candidacy for local council was elected Friday by acclamation - meaning no one came forward to challenge him so no election will be necessary and he is automatically the winner. He is flush with victory at the moment. I have decided to come forward anyways about the emotional and sexual abuse that I experienced during the relationship. I know I may pay a price for speaking openly in our small community.,Stress
28840,I'm in desperate need for someone online to just understand and talk to me about it preferably someone that has recovered from it or someone who knows about the addiction. I dream of becoming a father and loving husband. I dream of reaching my goals in life. I dream of being the happy kid I once was. I don't need advices to different clinics as I live in Sweden.,Stress
28841,"I've been couchsurfing now for 75 days and life is getting harder at this time as money is sinking. Been getting into bad thought loops so I decided to write a blog that allows me to express my sadness through more ""happy"" words. I currently have two posts. [First one <url> was about how I ended up in this situation and describing overall how am I doing and the latest one is about last week and how mentally challenging it was to be sick as a homeless person. <url>",Stress
28849,His price is even higher than what I was told and he said that's after a discount. I'm a college student and apart from tuition I have food and other things to fund and I thought that by paying this much I'd at least get my money's worth in therapy but other than telling him about my anxiety and family and having him tell me I probably have OCD and Anxiety disorder all I seem to hear is the rates of the therapies and how it would take over a year of dynamic therapy preferably 2 times a week at 80$ a session and that I should be able to commit if I want to continue. The second session he continued with this spending nearly 30 minutes saying I have 3 options seeing a psychiatrist and taking pills going to CBT to treat 'only the symptoms' or seeing a dynamic therapist like him for sessions which would take a year at least to see results. What's more the second the clock ticks 50 minutes he says have a nice day and sort of kicks me out. So I'm supposed to believe this person talking about money on time I pay him money to talk to me about my greatest fears is gonna help me?,Stress
28850,I'm having a rough time right now and going through some things where my anxiety and depression keep dragging me down. My roommates have not really experienced someone with anxiety before really. At least not someone who gets attacks. During the recovery of one of my episodes I came up with this writing in the notes of my iPhone. So here it is.,Stress
28851,I've been trying to remain hopeful that these symptoms won't really start improving until 6-8 weeks like the first time I took it to relieve depression. It doesn't help that after looking up SSRI withdrawal online I've read reinstating might not work the longer I'm off it and it's recommended to take a very low dose in order to alleviate symptoms. This is leaving me worried since I've stopped for a month and took a higher dosage than I last left off. It doesn't say what happens if I happen to take a high dosage so I'm worried I'm making things worse by continuing with this high dosage and I have no idea what to do right now. I feel very messed up and I'm scared these withdrawal symptoms will never go away or may become permanent.,Stress
28853,But the days leading up to the test were the worst. I couldn't sleep 2 nights in a row and had to call in sick to work. I had a near panic attack and was unable to eat much as i felt like throwing up. Before the test my hands were shaking and my heart was racing. I was really not in a state to drive.,Stress
28855,Sorry for the super long post but I don't want to tell my mom all this and most of my friends don't know I feel like this almost all the time. I take my medicine for social anxiety every morning and I go to counseling every few weeks but I've been to a counselor four or five different times over the years and I'm still the same. I think I might be stuck like this. I honestly doubt anyone read this far but if you did hello! TL;DR freshman year of high school I'm super anxious about pretty much everything especially PE and disappointing my family by not coming out on top,Stress
28856, About a month or two ago I saw my doctor about going on an anti anxiety med for general anxiety disorder (GAD) and was put on Lexapro. I've never taken an SSRI before but I find it has helped me tremendously with my other anxiety symptoms. However the globus still remains and I'm at my wits here about how to stop this sensation. Has anyone here experienced this? Is there a way to treat this?,Stress
28858,and now it's like he did a complete 180 and decided that I have to do exactly what he wants. I'm sure that he is worried about his children going wild as young adults like he did which is fair but frankly I've always been very responsible with money drinking and just about everything else. I've always been told that I'm mature for my age and have never been anything near a problem child. I really don't think there's any cause for him to worry so much about me and I'm terrified of standing up to him because frankly he does stuff like take my phone away or monitor my spending so I don't feel safe standing up to him. I obviously can't go along with this forever.,Stress
28859,*Sigh* I fucking bailed on the plan today to get my suicidal headcase of an ass to a hospital for admittance to a psych ward. My PTSD got triggered when I got in the ambulance so I fucking jumped out the side door. They chased me down an alley and found me hiding behind a truck. Police got involved more PTSD triggers but he was nice and spoke French which comforted me a little.,Stress
28866,For a while now I honestly feel like my brain just broke. I am so embarrassed. I used to be really quick at replying to stuff really good at video games (I would play competitively!! ) The world was easy to navigate... Now it feels like someone beat me with a rock in the head and I never recovered from the concussion. Everything seems so... Fast.,Stress
28868,He's not seeing a therapist or psych regularly which we agreed that he needed to be doing if he was going off his meds. I'm just at this weird point with myself where I'm holding back this resentment and anger at him for not taking care of himself even after I've explained to him how much it stresses me out and hurts me when he is not consistent with his self care and/or medication. Though things are as normal as they can be right now I find myself getting angry when he asks me to promise to do specific things for him like do my laundry (I'm a bit of a mess) because it just reminds me of how he wouldn't keep that promise yet he expects me to do things for him (even though they are rational requests I should take care of anyway). Well it still ended up being long my apologies! What should I even do from here?,Stress
28869,Example 2. There was this life goal we had together and I happened to accomplish it much quicker than she did but instead of being happy for me she would get super jealous and make me feel like shit for it. Even though I helped her in every possible way to accomplish that goal too. Example 3. Whenever she sees that I'm upset about something she'd buy gifts tell me that she has something planned for us (which later would turn out to be a lie) etc.,Stress
28871,In my mind I am in control of this I don’t feel I ‘have’ to try. I can get away. It’s like I’m using drugs to escape but I’m not on drugs I’m just dissociating to a place I want to be. I feel that if I was forced to be in reality I’d be just as angry and terrified as a drug addict in rehab. I don’t know what to do.,Stress
28873,I’m in Florida can’t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse. As in me getting my name off lease and him staying here. My fiancé is mentally and emotionally abusive. We have had some physical altercations like him pushing me down poking me hard in the chest him ripping off his shirt and than hitting me with it. He’s also broken a few pairs of glasses a remote control smashed the hell out of his iPhone and threw a chair across the room almost hitting his dog.,Stress
28876,So he hasn't really hit me since we got back together but he's cruel in so many other ways. He will call met fat ass (I'm 5ft8 and 130 pounds) and just had our third child. He tells me I'm ugly and a dumb b****h and tells me I can't do anything right. He constantly calls me a whore. He tells me a whore for not kiwearing a bra in our house.,Stress
28879,"It's horrible. The thing is my urologist told me that it was just an overactive bladder and gave me some medicine but it just worked a couple of days when I was ""totally positive"" about the medicine. Even after taking the pills I felt great like in a normal state but the symptoms are here again. Is it possible that the cause could be my sometimes uncontrollable anxiety? Have someone had the same problem?",Stress
28884,I was physically and sexually abused by my mom as a kid. She would pull my pants down and fondle my genitals from the time I was a child up until I moved out for college. This is something where I know it happened and I can remember time after time how it had happened. About a month ago though I had a really vivid and visceral nightmare about a form of sexual abuse that I can't place in a timeline like I can with the other types of abuse. In this nightmare my mom and I are naked in bed and she is touching me until I get so scared that I push her away and fall out of the bed.,Stress
28885,Today was a really bad day. I had no energy and I cried and I thought about suicide all day. I'm afraid things will never change for me. I'm not strong enough to change things for myself and I have no help. What can I do?,Stress
28887,During my service I got suddenly rowdy and would fight a lot with marines and civilians that resulted in many nights in jail. I have been to captains mast twice (Inciting a riot breach of peace destruction of government property). Today I sometimes I call in sick because I have pauses I call them where I can’t seem to be too far from home or I get a sudden feeling of not being safe or keep my family safe. I have a million excuses why I cannot do something or go somewhere. I can’t fly I can’t sit in the center of a crowd I must be by the door and there has to be more than one door.,Stress
28888,There aren't a lot of people in my life I can talk to. I did have a therapist who I clicked with really well but I had to stop seeing him when my work comp case closed. I just started seeing a new one but haven't gotten to the point where I really feel I can rely on her yet as I've only seen her a couple of times. The crisis lines have been very unhelpful. I just need some support.,Stress
28889,Hi /r/relationships I'm hoping you can give me some perspective. I am at a loss on how to handle this situation. I am so sorry at how long this is but I needed to vent and hopefully one or two kind people will be able to help me process this. I want to provide some background from my side of these events. For the last year I've been in a high-profile high-stress management position with my company.,Stress
28890,He constantly threaten to take our son and I’ll never see him again. Last night I started a journal less about the abuse and more about my feelings on a day to day basis. This morning he hide my meds from me after an hour I woke him and asked where they were. He cussed me out and told me he not to talk to him until 1pm. Last night he forced me into our son’s room and as I was trying to escape he slapped my wrist in the door.,Stress
28891,My son was septic with respiratory distress for 5 hours (my husband and i didn't know at the time) and the medical staff was too incompetent to realize. The ambulance staff was even worse. My son almost died in the beat-up ambulance as well. It was horrible. We finally got to a bigger hospital where he was on antibiotics for nearly a month.,Stress
28892,*Major trigger warning* I find comfort in confined spaces and can spend prolonged time in confined spaces verycomfortably. This is odd to most people but I’ll explain why. When I was with my parents they were super abusive. They forced me to watch animals die and frequently changed around my room so I wasn’t familiar with it. They forcefully put splinters in my feet allowed men to sexually assault me and they even pepper sprayed me a couple times as a 2 year old.,Stress
28893,But i think the worst part is her emotional abuse. Like having fun to make me scared or cry and also always putting me down like i am not good enough or ignoring me. Also i feel like she is sexually attracted to me (i am 17 now) and uses some shitty pretending to touch me between my legs or butt. I once tried to talk with my dad about it but he said that he and mom have enough to do and i should pull myself together. I feel like i really have to seek help but i am so scared that people wont take me serious and think i am exaggerating.,Stress
28897,Everything about my existence was a burden to her. I wasn't exposed to one huge trauma. I was little traumas over a long period of time. I know feel very unsafe all the time and scare. I'm constantly afraid of I don't know what.,Stress
28900,"Every day I'd tell myself I was over this girl but I'd see her at school and instantly be reminded of how much I liked her. Every time I saw her I almost wanted to cry. Throughout the year I kept trying to ""win her back"" by forcing intimacy by telling her things about my past I'd never told anyone (never told her about being raped though). This just made her think I was weird. On the first day of summer I noticed she'd blocked me on all forms of social media and I no longer had a way to talk to her.",Stress
28901,I especially appreciate stories of similar experiences and such. I hope everyone's have a nice day. TL;DR: I ended up with anxiety due to relationship and health anxiety and now I can't stop thinking about how I might some terminal illness (cancer) just because I feel some weird tingling or pain in an area I didn't before. Or even a cough can freak me out a little. If you also/used to suffer from this how do/did you deal with it?,Stress
28903,So now I'm here not knowing what to do. I don't want to call the cops because I don't want my mom to get in any trouble for her gambling habits. So I need some advice for what to do incase something like this ever happens again. **tl;dr**: My mom cuts her boyfriend because he grabbed her by the throat and I don't know what to do. **UPDATE**: After this incident with her boyfriend my mom wants to move out of the house.,Stress
28904,"People who've been my ""friends"" for a decade stopped talking to me or inviting me to anything after my break-up. A guy who I've been making plans to see for two months on a weekly basis just cancelled again (we haven't gotten together at all). Another person I was trying to date bailed because of something I can't control. I'm not worth these people's time. My boss scares the daylights out if me (stern Russian lady who expersses herself horribly).",Stress
28905,Every rational part of me believes I'm retroactively terrified of the fact I almost didn't get to live the life I'm living now. I wish I wouldn't think about it. But I just keep doing it. It's like I get some sick thrill out of the fear and anxiety like it's a horror movie or rollercoaster. I know I shouldn't be feeling that way about it but I am and I don't know why or how to stop it.,Stress
28906,We will get through this and I am determined even it means going to a shelter to get affordable housing so i never end up in this situation again! Ive been financially abused in small ways for almost a year paying more than my share while he saved. Being forced into buying a computer we couldnt afford then had it thrown at me every fight due to credit card he continuously used (kept under 1k) I also was forced to be precise on where i put things especially when cleaning as to not disrupt him. He hid snacks and 420 from me when I did most of the purchasing.,Stress
28908,I've been homeless for a couple days since my roommate completely screwed me by not paying rent for 5 months and hid notices from me. I only had a week to move out and get things into storage. I was able to find a roof to sleep under for a short time but it's severely roach infested and I have to sleep on the floor. There isn't anything availible at my price range certainly not on that short of a notice. I had a few prospects but they went to other people.,Stress
28909,My therapist told me to do some free writes about my anxiety and OCD thoughts (being afraid of panic attacks and fear I will act on violent thoughts) and in the book Imp Of The Mind the author talks about writing out thoughts. I just don't know how to set it up. Do you write as if the thought came true? Do you just write the thought is there and why it isn't true? Anyone do anything like this?,Stress
28910,I was left to hold the burden of explaining to other people why he wasn't talking to them or why he said something hurtful. I was okay with that. But I told him on many many very blunt occassions 'I am not okay with just sucking your dick. I feel like you aren't putting in the effort with me and I feel sick and uncomfortable doing this.' I said this in a variety of forms as well as having panic attacks - not anxiety attacks full-on violent shivering mute shut-down crying overstimulated feeling like you're about to die panic attacks - most of the times when we were intimate.,Stress
28911,It's only happened twice and only happens when he drinks. I love him dearly and want to help/support him. He cries and says he's sorry and admits that he is aggressive when he drinks. I'm so heartbroken I don't know what to do? Is this even considered domestic abuse/violence?,Stress
28912,I tried some cheese and some had pretty intense flavors and being an highly sensitive person this i think caused some stress. We stood for about an hour when i felt this dropping feeling in my stomach. I knew this was a sign to get some food and sit down but my dad was very happy checking out cheeses so i risked just waiting and chilling out. Then my whole body felt that dropping sensation and my hearing started going. I started getting warm and it felt like pin needles on my body.,Stress
28915,He's in a group of people. The problem is that because of what happened to me (police brutality/stalking) the general public think the police are the good guys and are not understanding when I give them explain that's not always the case. My doctor was almost treating my fear of police as a phobia instead of what it truly is... PTSD! This is my first post here. I appreciate any insight or experience y'all may have with seeking treatment.,Stress
28917,I have been abused mentally and physically by my step-father when being only 7 and it didn't stop until 12 when I moved to Britain and lived there to this day (17 yr now). Everyday I was told how worthless I was and was getting beat regularly. However I coped with it. At the start when I came to England I was crying all the time when I was called stupid and idiot or was hit by a friend (A kind of a friendly abuse you know when you just want to annoy your friends). Everyone thought I was just a crybaby not knowing of my past.,Stress
28918,I don’t know if anxiety/depression have anything to do with memory performance but I’ve noticed that I remember a lot less compared to when I wasn’t in a depressed and anxious state. For hours on end I contemplate and procrastinate everyday about my depressing life. It’s just sad. Anything I can do to cope with this? Could I get an accommodation from my school for this?,Stress
28919,"? To me is heartbreaking to know that the most I can achieve is to keep defending myself but not getting to be loved accepted and cared. I know that somatic therapies may somehow help me to develop discernment but that is not what i'm looking for. i'm looking for ways to attract healthy people.

28921,Hi everyone and thank you in advance for reading. I moved my family from Texas to Colorado thinking I had a new job lined up on the other side - this job fell through. Fortunately I have a new job starting January 23rd but I don't have enough in savings to carry me through. We are running very low on necessities like bread and milk. I am unable to go to the local food banks because I still only have a Texas DL I can't afford to transfer my license or vehicle registration.,Stress
28923,Hourly employees start arriving at 4am and then myself and the other managers will delegate the days plan to the employees. We are typically very understaffed to be able to work in new items recover the floor and excute the GM’s planned item moves for the day so after we delegate the managers become stockers and work alongside the hourly employees to get done. I don’t mind physical labor and hard work it’s actually my favorite part of my job but it’s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking. The store opens at 9:30 am at which point I will try to start my administrative tasks but just like in the morning the building is usually understaffed so it’s more common than not for me to be either cashiering for several hours or helping out in the deli and/or bakery. Some days I’m lucky enough to get a lot of time in the office to complete my daily tasks but most days I do not.,Stress
28924,It stuck with me. It made me realize I wasn't as happy as I thought. After that my confusion took over. I drank got high made friends. I knew I was a mess but was working on it.,Stress
28925,"Telling me I wasn't pretty enough my boobs weren't large enough I wasn't thin enough I wasn't a good girlfriend to him I wasn't making him happy. He told me he didn't feel loved unless I was having sex with him and only then did he feel happy. He would threaten constantly to leave and oftentimes did as a power grab when I got ""out of hand"" and then would make me beg for him back. I felt so unsure of myself. I wasn't enough and that's why he was leaving.",Stress
28928,Later that night someone snuck into the building we were sleeping in and killed Daniel.. he was chopped up with what I presume was a hatchet. I don't know why they spared me or Jay to this fucking day but I'd gladly take Daniel's place he was the sweetest boy I ever knew. We were heartbroken and I vowed that I would find the bastard and get revenge for Daniel. I'm crying as I am typing this part because this is what fucked me up the most. Chapter seven: adopted,Stress
28929,After unsuccessfully looking for a girlfriend on dating sites and personals I made a simple post on CL looking for a friend that basically said that my life was too much of a mess for me to really date but I'm trying to be more social etc. I was upfront with the fact that I have PTSD and am getting help. I was expecting mostly spam messages from bots etc... surprisingly like 90% replies were just mostly people telling me to grow up without even knowing what my life is like or what I've gone through. The other 10% were adult babysitters and spam. This is kind of what lead to my isolation in the first place.,Stress
28930,She's sworn at me at times. **tl;dr**: Girlfriend cheated on me twice. Is always adamant about keeping contact with the people she cheated with. The relationship is at its wits end. p.s.,Stress
28933,"(NSFW) I have really bad PTSD induced anxiety due to rape situations and being a victim to dozens of emotionally abusive relationships and I am engaged to a HVAC service technician. One day he was going to do a check up on a furnace he called before hand and he even gave notice the day before and I was at school at the time so I didn't see the message till a little later. He walked into the house because the door was unlocked (because some people leave their door unlocked if they're downstairs or something) and he walked into the kitchen and it was a crack house immediately he had a gun pointed at him and he froze for a second and ran back to his van the guy shot half a dozen times and hit the rear view mirror he almost got shot so many times while running to the van and when I saw this I was hysterically sobbing in the middle of the school hall and when I got home I got to my mom and kept screaming ""he almost died he almost died"" and my mom thought I said he died because I could barely breathe he seems to be over it now but every time he is a little late coming home from work or hasn't replied in awhile I get so scared hes dead and late at night I can't sleep because I'm scared this is the last day I'll have with him. I don't know what to do.",Stress
28934,"Last week I posted about having to travel to Melbourne with my Sister who is a really nasty person well it ended up being exactly what I feared she was just plain nasty to me the entire 3 days. From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment she would just do nothing but complain about me saying that I'm so ""over dramatic"" and that ""I'm just anxious for attention"".......I mean really? I never wanted to be like this and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person. Now I will admit she has issues of her own she has been pregnant so I can excuse her for that but she has been like this for a few years now I remember how I was anxious about my elbow swelling up and she said it was ""nothing"" and it turned out to be cellulitis. Ever since I came back from Melbourne I've just been overthinking things and when I do it flares the anxiety right up.",Stress
28936,I’m just really scared about this entire situation and feel conflicted about what to do. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened as my dad has previous jail records and he’s threatened our family before and even hit us when we were smaller. I just feel really scared and really confused about everything and can’t believe it’s come to this. My mom doesn’t want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate (I’m in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really can’t/shouldn’t) so she can divorce him she only wants to wait because she can’t support us by herself. If we do move I would be fine with getting a full-time job to support my family I’m already a private tutor but I only do 1-hr a week for $20.,Stress
28938,#NAME?,Stress
28941,He knows I can't work because of my anxiety problems and he knows I rely on him. He's told me before no one else will take care of me like he does no one else will put up with me. I'm scared to go back because I don't want to get back together with him and I know if he wants to we will. The reason I went to my grandma's house is because a couple days before I left he got drunk. He started saying horrible things to me.,Stress
28942,My mother on the other hand tells me that she is doing all she can when i explained to her about the way she dresses in front of him she blames him for not creating the opportunity to wear something nice. ie not going out someplace due to him preferring to do work. Listening to both sides separately have put me in a place where i am helpless and cannot do anything. All i can do is withdraw into myself and think about other things to relieve myself. Its basically that they dont understand each other.,Stress
28943,I'm not polyamorous at all and he never mentioned being bisexual to me. I didn't know what to say. I kinda went into blank smile mode while inside I was getting sick with jealousy. He never asked if this was okay for him to do this. So I considered it cheating.,Stress
28945,I loved her and I was completely broken. In July of 2016 I went out to a gaming hall/bar that my friend's family owns. I remember pushing on the doors to start making my way back home and then waking up in the hospital. I was told that I had suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) facial fractures a ruptured right ear drum and a cerebrospinal fluid leak. I spent one week in the hospital before I discharged myself against medical advice.,Stress
28948,She wants to do anything she can do to help me but it's up to the state not her to charge me. I have and documented once I got out of jail a puncture bite on my right hand a puncture bite on my left inner elbow deep scratches all over my left arm The skin on my scrotum was torn (the jail underwear they gave me was soaked at the end of the day) my lip busted open a chipped tooth my whole right side of my face red and sore from a dozen punches and a welt on my left leg from her kicking me. Now I'm being charged with 4th degree DV and need legal counsel to prove my innocence. I have no money to hire anyone and am still in shock that I just had to spend 17 hours in jail without given any medical aid in a small cell with 7 other inmates. I have no criminal record whatsoever until now.,Stress
28950,Now its personal so it hurts a lot more. There are nightmares where I am murdered those don't hurt half as much as these. I woke up a few nights ago screaming because of it and I cried like an idiot until I realized it wasn't real. Figured I'd rant here instead of breaking my hands on my heavy bag. You guys ever get extremely worried about your partners safety to the point where it triggers you?,Stress
28951,But I’ve also had a lot of pain and it seems to be getting worse. It didn’t use to last as long as it does now I’ve been lying in pain for hours. Nothing helps I’ve taken painkillers and they haven’t helped at all.. Should I mention this to a doctor? ?,Stress
28953,* Trigger warning. The past two weeks I have been recovering from life saving surgery and because of the physical consequences I have had four panic attacks in two weeks. Today I had my fourth one. My original trauma is not related to the hospital but to rape. But now any time a nurse needs to do something I associate with pain or something else because of the past trauma my brain gets triggered into a panic attack.,Stress
28954,"I know I want to be treated like a human being and it's very easy for others to say ""YOU NEED TO QUIT YOUR JOB ASAP. Stand up for yourself!"" But it's like leaving a bad relationship...so full of uncertainty and tension. Please help. I'm clinging onto the last bit of hope I have.",Stress
28955,We lived together so I spent the whole day yesterday packing up my things and crying. I’m heartbroken but knowing he’s unfaithful makes it easier for me to move on because it’s his fault. Not mine. I don’t know if something I did drove him to find someone else but I know I didn’t deserve to get cheated on. Anyways he doesn’t know that I found out and I’m planning to simply move out without a trace.,Stress
28956,Wtf is wrong with this society? ! I’m pissed. I’m angry. My abuser is a well known coach who has lost his job over our court cases.,Stress
28957,I’m very frustrated by this and don’t know what to trust. On the one hand these dreams could very well be pointing to reality. On the other they could simply be playing out fears I had. And I just don’t know which. What do I trust?,Stress
28959,I've started having flashbacks tearfulness intrusive thoughts and flashbacks again. I've been having a rough time lately. Something that helps me during these times is to find a small space or bathroom to hide in for a while or to reach out to partners of friends. Today feels really hard and even though I want to run away I know I can't. How're you all doing?,Stress
28960,It’s Open Enrollment most government systems in the US are poorly managed so most go without full knowledge what they’re signing up for and the pressure of management can be intense to reach certain “metrics.” I enjoy the money but the politics of it all be disconcerting. It’s not at all what I want to do with my life. I’ve been in and out of doctors appointments for my thyroid goiter. My mom said my great grandfather had the same thing and it causes anxiety. But most of it stems from my verbally abusive alcoholic dad and being raped twice in my life.,Stress

28965,I recently got out of a 2+ year abusive relationship and am now going to court against him with domestic violence charges. Originally I was told that I wouldn’t have to testify as there was ample evidence but now I am being told I must testify about a week from now. I am terrified to see my abuser in court and I was wondering what I should expect. Does anyone have any advice for me or can tell me what I should expect at the trial? Thank you so much.,Stress

We had a talk about sex last night and she just said it's painful and she wishes so hard that we could have sex all the time but she is in pain it's like certain positions or even going down on her is the best option. Can anyone give me any advise moving forward? She keeps telling me ""I don't know why you are with me because of this"" (somewhat sarcastically) and I let her know that I am here for her and we will work this out no matter what but at the same time I want her satisfy her sexually on a regular basis.",Stress
28969,I'm looking for some encouragement to get through a phase where I currently just want everything to be over. Im so tired of thinking about things over and over.

Nope...that's just not going to happen as soon as he was out of earshot the cRap music and loud partying resumed. So I sit in my room perplexed as what to do about this(wanting to get some much needed sleep) as it seems asking them to turn the music down and to quiet down was not going to happen. (obviously they're above the rules and law and don't give a shit about others in the motel) So I sat there thinking and I decided to call the owner/manager one last time and tell him PLEASE get these people to be quiet and turn the music down and to quit being so damn loud. He tells me ""I have told them 2 times to turn the music down and be quiet and they won't listen to me why don't you call the police yourself"" I was floored by him saying this to me and told him it was NOT my job to enforce the rules it was his.",Stress
28977,I'm so stressed at the moment I pretty much had a breakdown in college from all the work I need to do and the deadline is next week. I have 4 different projects in on the same day at the same time and I'm doing the best I can to manage my time but it's nothing simple like typing up an assignment. It's programming work and as much as I do enjoy programming having to create 4 different projects with 3 different languages is causing me to panic and stress out on getting things done. I've spoken to student support and a couple of tutors but I can't switch my mind off how many deadlines I have and the worst part is that I can't do 3 of them at home. I can only do them during college hours.,Stress
28978,I did a few EMDR sessions had great success but also don't want to go through that again as I became severely depressed in the days following sessions. Anyone else sharing this feeling?? Like maybe sometimes its better/easier to not go to therapy and revisit everything and try to get ahold of it yourself? I definitely do have a skill set learned from my time in therapy that I feel I can rely on right now but if I get worse I am not sure if just that is enough...though hopeful I will not get worse. Would appreciate your feedback whether you also share these feelings or if you think it is better to return to therapy.,Stress
28979,I'm not the kind of guy who likes to ask for help with things like this especially when it feels like there are so many people with worse problems but after three years of trying to save up on a disabled person's income with nothing but failure (as soon as I have a little saved something else comes up) and at the encouragement of my online acquaintances I have decided to try setting up a gofundme account in order to get dentures: <url> I feel like I have tried every government assistance program and charity in the US but as a 35 year old male there is no help for me. I'm not young enough for assistance I'm not old enough for assistance and I am not a female with kids so there is just no help available. As proof here is the thread I made three years ago. I wasn't asking for anything then just showing off the teeth I had pulled: <url>,Stress

28983,The prospect of this has me utterly overwhelmed right now though.

Even if you can't help me financially any sort of aid would be helpful.

28992,this has been happening for the longest time and it's very hard to describe so bear with me. once in a while when i'm trying to sleep suddenly my racing mind starts experiencing opposites at the same time. the most terrifying one is feeling like the world is expanding infinitely but also crushingly contracting in on itself. then there's also times when i focus so much on the silence in the environment that i end up feeling like the room sounds extremely loud. and a more physical one is feeling hot and cold at the same time which prevents me from being comfortable enough to fall asleep.,Stress

28996,I seem to have these bouts of anxiety. I'm not constantly anxious but if something worries me enough there's a good chance I'll start on this downward spiral.

29020,I was severely neglected as a child by my mother but this isn't about the neglect (although it may make an appearance at some point) I think my twin and I were sexually abused by her first boyfriend (the man she had an affair with). I have a distinct memory of lying in my bed at night and there being a male figure crawling up towards me this is more of a still frame though. The others however I remember vividly to a point one was a very inappropriate tickling game where my sister was under her duvet and he was on top of her tickling except he was also humping I can't remember much more than that the other is walking to his house I remember the exact route going in and him showing me his house I can't remember anything once he showed me his bedroom other than the bedding was white I don't remember leaving or what happened in between but I remember things like he had an Eiffel Tower figure he made in his front room. I started masturbating at a young age and I wonder if this is linked in. I've been suffering a lot recently and I am on medication and undergoing therapy but these bouts are cyclic I always end up back in this position after a while perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years) I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.,Stress

29024,I have been thinking about it and I think that all anxiety seems to boil down to either fear of what other people think of you or fear of death. I am curious if this is just me? Sometimes simplifying it makes it easier for me to deal with at least during less intense moments where I still have control of my mind. I realize a fear of death is a bit unbeatable but some how that seems to give me a bit of peace. The one that I have a hell of a time with is fear of what other people thinking.,Stress

I'm not the smartest person in my family and have got the lowest grades but I've always been excellent with my literacy but when I'm talking to either my family or friends the words just can't come out.

29040,I'm aware I have problems when it comes to dating I get jealous paranoid and suspicious very easily. I hate it about myself and hide it from my boyfriend very well. Take for example my bf we have each other on snapchat we maybe send one or two to each other a day it's not like a thing we do but it could be I tried to send him more but it wasn't reciprocated. Yet I always see his snapchat score go up by like 30 or more at a time (I know I shouldn't snoop it just feeds my problems but I can't help it). Anyway I just get jealous that he snaps loads to other people but not me I don't know who.. it could be another girl.. he never sends a face pic to me but is he to others and if so why not me?,Stress
29041,I’m trying to get into Freelance writing but these libraries want physical original ID’s so I’m doing everything by phone which is now also hard to do… because of charger thieves. Ugh.

29043,Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has. The first few weeks he was good at hiding it but it started coming out. He was full of compliments for me but they were pretty generic and he took me on a bunch of dates. The last few days I was kind of avoiding him and he kind of tried getting controlling. Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,Stress

29045,Just realised in my greatest moment of need no one could be there for me despite me seeking it out and reaching out first. These are 'friends' Ive talked to about issues before. My heart is beyond broken to find myself at once again a second round of realisation that I have no friends to be there for me. People have stuff to get on in their lives and cannot always be there for me. I get it.,Stress
29046,My situation is that I might be homeless for about a month. I have plenty of money coming in from my clients during the month of Octobermore than enough to meet the 3x income requirement for most apartments in the city where I plan to move (my hometown). However my lease here ends Sept 30. I don't have quite enough to meet the 3x income requirement before then. Some of my clients have really slow pay schedules.,Stress
29048,So I have a csf leak. It isn't diagnosed but being that its pretty much the only thing(I don't have any heart issues) that causes orthostatic headaches and and the other problems im having its probably a csf leak. If I stand for more than 10 minutes or so after I wake up I develope a horrible headache that feels like its pressing downwards and I basically become retarded. Like I cant even walk straight. I think my vision is starting to be affected too.,Stress
29051,That being said I feel like every idea I have to contribute gets shot down. It doesn't help that I'm not the best at communicating ideas. I feel like I'm at a dead end and am not being considered to move up because of it. It's gotten me so anxious that I don't know what to do except look for other opportunities. I feel like he's just pretending to appreciate what I do.,Stress
29052,I recently became depressed and am now understanding that I’ve also had anxiety my whole life but I am waiting to see a specialist to have a diagnosis. My doctor is pretty easy goin and will give me pretty much whatever medication I want. Lately I’ve been trying this and trying that to find a good combination of meds. My foquest would make me very depressed in the evenings and morning so I went off foquest and went on Wellbutrin XL at 150mg a day.

Is this just another guy who made me fall in love with him and think that he loves me and cares about me and he actually doesn´t give a damn about me?"" I don´t want to have these thoughts so I try to stop myself from thinking about that all but sometimes I just can´t stop and I feel too bad ( for no real reason actually because I honestly feel like he loves me a lot. ).

29058,The next day after a meeting he tried confronting her about being ignored. To other people it’s nothing however to me I can’t stand the thought of her being assaulted or harassed in that way. I think he might be working later today when she’s working. We both discussed that she would “tell him to stop and that she has a boyfriend and if he doesn’t stop she’ll tell the manager” which I’m okay with. Except all I want to do is protect her part of me knows that she’s going to be okay but I need some advice about how I should address the issue if this guy doesn’t stop keep in mind the fact that I can wrestle and basically fight and can someone tell me something that will help me hold onto the hope?,Stress

29061,I have suffered for years through an abusive relationship with my husband. Drunk driving attempting to detain me in one place so he could continue to yell at me child endangerment stalking physical and sexual abuse cheated on me multiple times (including one instance I am sure was actually rape). I kicked him out months ago and filed for divorce as soon as I was able after that. Now I have a court date for the restraining order for me and my son which I finally gathered up the courage (and the witness testimony) to file. I know that everything I've said is true and I'm confident that my evidence is strong.,Stress

I guess I don't know what to do it's a complicated situation and I feel that I'll never get the ""real talk"" I'd like to have with him or any sort of apology. He seems rather narcissistic not as bad as my own father but enough to not want to admit his wrong doing and own up to it. Is this something I can get over on my own while still around him? Am I over exaggerating?",Stress
29064,My father was diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer and while it's well-controlled the side effects of his hormonal and chemo treatments have left him far more emotional (but at least unable to just sublimate his depression/anxiety into anger and vent it at any available target anymore) and the physical side effects have forced him into an early retirement meaning 80% of the time he's home and sitting in the livingroom. He's no longer directing the same vitriol and venom at me that he used to and neither does my sister but... It's all the little things they do to invalidate my feelings treating more like a live-in servant than a family member and the occasional outbursts if they get angry/upset that trigger me badly... It's making me lose ground lose progress and I'm having more and more trouble coping with everyday life... And I'm afraid I'm going to just break. Crumble under the weight of it all...,Stress
29065,Also you’re incredibly ditzy and that gives off the idea that you’re stupid.” Last week she rudely corrected me in front of a patient and then rolled her eyes and shook her head. The patient leaned into me and said “What the heck was that about?” I finally got fed up and went to my boss. This coworker is very manipulative and loves to gaslight me. She will say or do something mean and then when confronted will deny the behavior and go off on all the things she saw me do “wrong” (basically stupid shit that is none of her business anyway. I sneezed into my elbow once and she lectured me on washing my hands.,Stress
29066,I’m tired of watching the days waste away before me because I’m so useless. I’m useless from the insomnia the depression anxiety and lack of motivation. My chronic illness has destroyed my life the resulting PTSD has only made it worse. I don’t know where this post is going. I don’t know what any comments will say.,Stress
29067,But I’m wondering if anyone here has chronic pain and feels the connection between the two. Now the PTSD has been been coming up. I’m sure I’m not alone but during the Kavanaugh hearings my symptoms became very severe. It’s still not entirely better. I know many studies have been done connecting PTSD with chronic pain especially for women.,Stress
29068,I literally have never been sick so much. Normally if I get sick at all it’s when allergy season comes so like once a year. My hair is definitely falling out way more than it normally does. Has this happened to anyone? I know it’s almost over.,Stress
29070,Even if that's true (and I believe her) I hate it. I've tried to explain my point of view and why I hate them still talking but every time it's brought up we always just end up arguing. She says I have no reason to be jealous of him and that she's VERY happy with me and that I'm overreacting. I'm not trying to create a problem when there isn't one but I feel like I have a point? I never want to tell her to stop talking to a friend but their history makes me uncomfortable.,Stress
29071,He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood. It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter. My family would be willing to take her in but we're not doing well w/ money either. I really want to do something about it but idk what i can do. He's been horrible to his family since forever.,Stress
29072,I would rather kill myself than hurt other people so why the fuck did that even occur to me? My therapist told me I'm meant to be alive and hugged me and I don't even know why because how could I be meant to be alive if I have thoughts like this? What's the point? It honestly feels like depression or ptsd or whatever this is has stripped me of normal human emotions and humanity and I'm just like this vacuum moving around undetected that people like my therapist fail to see is awful and unlovable and unfixable. I don't feel anything in conversations I have trouble with empathy sometimes.,Stress
29073,My boss asked my lead who is friends with that person about it. My lead came to me and told me that she knows that i spoke to the big boss and they both expressed to me that what i did was the right thing. i dont really trust them to keep this confidential anymore. Im worried ill gain the tattletale reputation and people will be a little more rude than they have been. How can I feel less anxious and more positive about this situation?,Stress
29074,I spoke with her after all was said and done and asked why. Reasons she gave me were that I didn't do enough housework and she felt underappreciated for the work she did that my libido is considerably higher that hers and it made her feel inadequate so she went outside the marriage to feel more like she could satisfy a person's sex drive and that I'm boring and the newness of everything was gone. Now I'm here picking up the pieces and trying to decide if I can learn to trust her again if I'm willing to put in the work and what I could have done to be a better husband to avoid this. I'm embarrassed and ashamed that I couldn't even hold a marriage together for 6 months. Currently she's sick because she also has untreated lupus and the stress of all of this has caused her immune system to weaken her joints to swell and her muscles to ache.,Stress

Clearly I need to move out but the only person I have in my life is my boyfriend and although we see each other often we've been long-distance for awhile and it would be a huge adjustment to move almost 100 miles away (although it would be far enough away from them.) Although I love him a lot I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me. I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him not to run away from the old if that makes sense. So I guess my question is what do I do?",Stress
29076,Where each person does what they do because they love the other person and get pleasure out of pleasing their partner. And I know this sounds so horrible and I hate myself for it but I almost feel like it will never happen. Like she's been broken.

29079,They have lives outside the group and are often coming from far away to go to this group. Should I try and be friends with them? I feel like they're not going to want to hang out with a dorky 23 year old and I have no idea what we'd even do anyway. I also tried Bumble BFF to make friends but found the constant swiping and texting to be really boring and depressing. There's only so much bland small talk a person can make.,Stress
29083,DO NOT BLAME HIM. PEOPLE WHO ABUSE ARE SOME OF THE MOST MANIPULATIVE AND BELIEVABLE LIARS. That being said; Parent's if you have a child who is going to EXTREMES to say show their disapproval for a person LISTEN TO THEM. CHILDREN FUCKING KNOW. And it is YOUR responsibility to ensure THEIR safety and happiness not satisfy your own at their cost.,Stress
29084,Do I ask the boss (who’s like family to me) to not bring him back once our coming winter layoff is over?

29087,It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.

I still think I love him but I find myself thinking about other people more and part of myself wants to see if I can do better. We get along great but I’ve always felt that our relationship has lacked an emotional aspect on his part. Part of the reason I want to end it also has to do with our financial situation - we’re both broke but I want to start working more to save more money because I’m trying to be more financially independent. I feel like he is somehow holding me back from my personal goals.,Stress

29097,Hi just wondering if anyone can relate to this. Sorry I made this long. I tend to have little or no anxiety in social situations... when they are currently happening.

29100,"My troubles began when I confronted her about withdrawing large and frequent amounts of cash from her account and asked her what she was spending all that money on when she wasn't paying for my siblings. I asked her for my 9 year old sister's dad number so I could bring up her not spending the child support money she was receiving on my sister. She refused to give me his number and since then I cannot even talk to her. She has even told me not to take my sister out with me and my brother because she says she does not have money to pay me back. If i mention anything about what I spend on them she say ""I need to see a receipt"" but when I ask if she bought anything for them and to show me a receipt she says ""Of course I don't keep them"".",Stress
29102,When I get stressed and angry and blow up I find myself blaming and cursing God a lot for the situation that has made me angry. Like He has always had it out to get me. Afterwards I feel so stupid and ashamed for my outbursts usually over very trivial thing. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety disorder however I never told my psych or therapist about this part of me because I just don't like talking about it. I have a child now who is turning 18 mo old and yesterday I had another big outburst when driving with her due to a stupid road rage issue.,Stress
29106,"I relate to a lot of the symptoms but what happened to me wasn't ""life threatening"" it was more of a childhood trauma that has a lot to do with growing up in a chaotic home.

He was often very negative had anger issues/tantrums impatient interrupted me a lot would ditch me for cocaine didn't know how to drink alcohol (often consumes until he pukes) was a hypochondriac always broke (yet had money for weed/shatter or sports betting or junk food or alcohol...) but at the same time did not look after his own health unless I pushed him to... just a lot of care-taking and issues. He has depression and anxiety as well. One of the things that really killed me inside about him was his last girlfriend who had died in a car crash about 1 year before he met me.,Stress

One of them he went to get us food while I was home with my son he paid for this woman's family's meal and got her number and has been asking her out for drinks every couple days. She sent me screen shots of their conversations and he said ""The ring I gave her is simply a gift to the woman carrying my child.

29122,But I told him that I’m not over it and his response was kinda like “ I feel so guilty it makes my life hard I wish you could just forgive me.” So now I feel pressured to forgive him and it’s frustrating because he didn’t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her. In fact I remember him telling me to shut up. He didn’t give a damn about my brother when he pushed him against a wall to yell at him when he was only in middle school.

Sometimes I have never ending anxiety that lasts for multiple days and flares up at the worst times. And if I drink caffeine oh man that makes it even WORSE. Nicotine withdrawal can compound this sometimes increasing my anxiety twofold and ironically making me too anxious to go out to smoke; which causes a vicious cycle that while temporary can really fuck me up for the time it’s going on. I’m wondering what I can do.,Stress

I told my dad I wanted to play football when I was 8. He told me I should try for the lingerie league instead. My mom used to go clothes shopping for me and he would tell me to wear the opened back and low cut shirts because “that’s what the boys like” even though I didn’t want to One night he walked into my room completely naked and turned my light on I woke up and he stood there for about five seconds completely nude and then turned the light off.,Stress

This was never how my life was supposed to be but when your mom who's financially irresponsible (lightly put) and lets you go to a school that is $150K without even knowing it I was basically doomed from the start and this is now my reality.

29152,on to friends I recently moved into my first apartment with my college roommate her boyfriend and another girl. I just feel lie everyone else in the house is so much closer and its really nerve wracking living with people in the first place especially because I know the boyfriend is a bit more reserved and having trouble adjusting i think to living with three girls. my roommate from last year is trying to be supportive but i know my low energy along with her own problems is sucking the life out of her som im trying not to bother her. in the past month i've broken up with a creepy guy taken my friend to the ER constantly felt ignored because technology sucks and i'm left on read if i even try an ex has obsessively messaged me and then the whole issues with the friends also in the leadership of clubs with me. im just a fucking mess.,Stress
29154,I'm scared to start the eviction process but I NEED to protect myself and my son. Hell im even scared to ask this asshole to take the trash out. I don't know what to do. I feel like an empty shell of a person with no strength to get out of this mess. This is mostly a rant but does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement?,Stress
29159,I'm not asking for a diagnosis but I'm just curious how it went for most people who were diagnosed with PTSD. Over the past 2 years or so - since an event happened in my life that I can't ever forget about - my anxiety has deepened a bunch. It's gotten to the point now where I regularly have nightmares about this event despite never remembering dreams and any loud noise makes me want to cry despite the fact I can't cry for the life of me. I have a few other things people commonly site but I'd rather not talk about them here on reddit. I'm trying to gather the courage to see a professional about this but for the time being I want to know how to went for you when you first thought you might have it - or if you even knew for that matter.,Stress
29162,Because not really. I would have survived I always have before I have gone three and four days without eating a single thing on dozens of occasions in the last fifteen years and I will be fine. The guy is wonderful and has helped me a great deal. But it felt like an intentional attempt to act like I am a burdensome charity case. I just don't know.,Stress
29164,It was terrible. I got pregnant again after he forcibly took my birth control away my 2nd son was born in Chile I didn't realize once I had my child in Chile I couldn't leave with my son without the father's permission. I think that was part of his plan. I lived 4 years of brutal hell. I finally made it back home in 2006 when one of the police officers who were called after he beat me luckily was married to a woman who worked at the American Embassy and they got me home within 2 weeks with both my son's.,Stress
29166,I’ve quit weed. I’ve started having nightmares again. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD (finally) and am working very little to try to get through this all. Now I’ve gone no contact with my dad and Tim as well. Dad never really respected this (as he never agrees with my views about what I need) Sent an email to Tim last November informing him that I can’t be around him anymore.,Stress
29168,It did still worry me a little though. Then last night I rushed to a doctor because I was getting severe chest pains and my heart was beating so fast. And today I've just been getting so many of my old symptoms back. Trouble breathing choking sensations weird body aches...you name it. I can't help but feel I've somehow taken two steps backward after doing so well.,Stress
29169,I need information. As emotional as I am right now I know I'm not thinking straight and am probably missing something as I research on my own. Any advice any info any resource or organizations that I can apply to to help pay for this is greatly appreciated. I'm in Kansas if that helps... Thank you.,Stress
29173,I want to talk about this because I have no support group and my wife can't handle much more. My uncle lives very close to me in NH.

I will be posting more under the title <username> My hope is you will read this comment and maybe it's happened to you.,Stress
29176,The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me and rages where I’ve felt threatened. These things have ruined my trust and love for him over time. The controls and double standards that are in place are extensive. So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving? I guess I need an extra push.,Stress
29178,I had no more than three consecutive appointments with each specialist before being shifted away to a different department then being put on a 3-6 month waiting list. I eventually got a new psychologist who admitted after four sessions he didn't have a clue what to do with me so I quit seeking treatment for a year. I've since attempted treatment again and was referred to CBT despite my protests. After two half hour sessions they decided to refer me back to psychology. I've been on a waiting list for the past 4 months and am beginning to lose hope.,Stress
29180,They discharged me. I told a nurse at a health clinic though where I got sutured that I just can't deal with the PTSD anymore and I feel awful on this injection of flupentixol. I'm suicidal.

29182,I will browse a book on a subject that I want or need to study research it think about how it's going to be then when the time for studying comes I'm thinking about something else. Sometimes I spend the day thinking about that hardcore workout I'm gong to do in the evening and then I spend the whole workout session thinking about something else. Sometimes even when I'm talking to people I like I realize my mind will wander. Does anyone feel these things? Do you think it's related to anxiety or do I have ADHD or something else?,Stress
29183,I've been in therapy (and will go back soon now) but I've never had to practice harm reduction around self harmI need practical advice. I know that because I've never felt so out of control than last night when I was hitting myself. TL;DR I got drunk last night destroyed my room and hit myself on the head hard enough to give myself welts for the first time in my adult life. I need advice on not doing this self harm crap.,Stress
29186,Short-end is my brain is using physical disorders like seizures because my brain has had enough and gone AWOL. On top of this I have these events where I black out.

My worries and my stress is constantly nagging me.,Stress

29192,I live in a high end building and I feel if I were to talk to the people who work in the office they wouldn’t take my name off the lease that they wouldn’t care. I have told a couples therapist and my individual therapist the things he has done in the past and what he says to me and his actions. I believe they would vouch for me. I also think if I were to say to the office people that I would like to leave before a real scene is made (cops being called screaming damage etc) that they will be more inclined to take my name off lease. Thoughts?,Stress

29194,We've been through so much. This is easily the toughest break up I've ever had; my other relationships were very easy to get over. **TL;DR** I broke up with my bf who had anger issues financial issues drug and alcohol issues depression and anxiety and unresolved feelings from a gf that died in a car crash 1 year before he met me.

29196,Oh fucking boy! My ex boyfriend made me think he was Prince Charming but then it turned out he was just an asshole who wanted to date my ex bully/stalker. She is JUST like me because she was obsessed with me for one and a half years. She is a prettier me so instead of leaving me like a normal person he abused me and used his incredibly strong narcissism to make every problem I had about him. He tried to make me dump him so his plan would all correlate.,Stress

29209,One of my flatmates has started distancing herself from me and I don't know what to do. I've never experienced this before as I've never really had a friendship this close with someone before. We used to see each other multiple times a day when we were both in the flat we used to spend loads of time in each other's rooms just chilling and chatting. But recently she's been spending more time with other people rather than me. Before today I don't think I saw her for about a week which is crazy considering how close we were and that we live under the same roof.,Stress

One of my biggest issues is that I'm prone to making small mistakes. They're not catastrophic but they happen more often than I'd like. I've had supervisors that get really annoyed over these small mistakes and they make me feel like my job is on the line.,Stress
29250,So I've recently started having anxiety attacks where it becomes hard to breathe with the subject regarding many topics mainly obsessing about relationships and government bureaucracies that I have to handle lately and mainly where my life is going.

29255,It sorta works but I don't like the feeling of being deadheaded. I also don't have a good relationships with doctors considering I was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen and given lithium... Had a terrible reaction to it. What are some more natural remedies or self-help you all do to keep yourself in the proper mindset to calm your triggers?

I really want to try and edit the paper into something worth reading without feeling like I can't breathe.,Stress
29259,Someone else’s suffering ensued. I feel immense sadness and guilt now. I am confronted by the memories and the recognition that to this day the experience became part of who I am. It made me stronger as facing fear and trauma can do. But I also internalized a sense of profoud fear and vulnerability.,Stress
29261,So I have been suffering from chronic anxiety for eight years.The kind where you feel some enemy is breathing down on your neck always.I don't want to get into the details of this matter because it's is very personal. But from the beginning of this anxiety my breathing got messed up. Like I was alternating my breathing between hyperventilation and shallow breathing through out the day for all these years. During these last five years I have suffered bone TB now stomach gastritis for three yearsalso found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like bone tb or stomach gastritis. So it seems to me this long chronic anxiety and the resulting hyperventilation and shallow breathing and high blood pressure did make my immune system rather weak or damaged.,Stress
29265,I do not want to hurt anybody. The therapist says it is self punishment that I want these people to tell me what a piece of shit I am to verify what I already believe. But I never ever think of it like that at the time. I feel better if they are kind and ambivalent or a tiny bit worse if they are cold and clinical. If it is unconscious well I am getting sick of that idea.,Stress
29266,To make a long story short I suffer from anxiety depression and PTSD due to past abuse since I was pretty young and recently had to move back home due to a traumatic event/mental health making it hard for me to survive on my own. This has made it very hard for me to be able to work/make money and support myself so my mother (being the kind woman she is) has helped out in feeding me but we're both low on food now and I feel horribly guilty and responsible. I'm trying every option I have out of desperation (this and a few other subreddits) and in the process of applying for assistance. Until then things are gonna be rough. If anyone can help out in ANY way I will really appreciate it.,Stress

29274,She thinks instead I should ask if I can read him how it has impacted me since this has happened. I don't know what to do. It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer. I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times. I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,Stress
29276,I feel like one of my worst symptoms is nightmares. Not because they are overly terrifying I don't wake up covered in sweat or out of breath. I just wake up feeling mentally and to a lesser degree physically exhausted. It just ruins my mood for the day and feels so hard to snap out of. I mostly just dream of killing my family and friends or other random people or people killing me or people dying.,Stress
29277,Basically he makes too much money for help has no other family or friends to help I can barely help myself let alone my dad and his two dogs...but he has literally no where to go and he's gonna be homeless by the time he gets put of his house which he is being evicted from. His credit is too low to get a place and now with this eviction it will be harder. Also he lives on a fixed income which isn't to bad but it's still not gonna be enough to move in a month considering his credit history. I don't want my dad to be homeless....what can he do? Sorry if this doesn't apply to this group...idk what else to do...,Stress
29278,The verbal emotions and physical abuse continued I also believe in my heart that he cheated He left Facebook up on his computer with a conversation he had had with another ex about how much fun it was spending time with her(a day he had told me he was working late couldn't even come up with an original lie)...it shattered me more I didn't know my heart could break into any smaller pieces When she was three months old I told myself enough was enough... If he had shown even a glimmer of interest in his child or our marriage I could justify more time...but he didn't,Stress
29279,But I'm literally afraid of him because I feel like every second he's gonna stand behind me again and grunt at me that he changed something or completely rewrite my code. Plus I don't know if maybe he is talking badly about me as well when I'm not there (it seems likely). What can I do? - **tl;dr**: Coworker who is supposed to show me the ropes is super grumpy and I find him intimidating can I do anything about this?,Stress
29281,And he got angry at me. He was yelling at me about how it was an accident he just forgot and all I do is bitch. When we got to the store we didn't even go in because he said I ruined his mood or whatever and we just went home. I cried all day. I just can't do it anymore and I'm so depressed and I'm so scared that I will end up going back to him.,Stress

As I mentioned I have received some emergency assistance in the form of loans through /r/borrow for which I am beyond grateful. But though they provide temporary relief the loans themselves just end up being part of this vicious circle and mire me even deeper in the debt I’m trying to escape. I know more loans aren’t the answer. So I’m looking for a different kind of help.,Stress
29292,My boyfriend is really understanding about everything but he wants me to eventually come clean to my mother because he thinks that it's unhealthy for me to have to keep this from my mom. PLus he knows how bad I'm freaking out about it. My brother and my dad know but they can't tell my mom and they aren't much help in this situation since my mother runs the house. For Christmas my boyfriend bought me a hat several CDs and concert tickets. Irrelevant right?,Stress

I wrote an email to the administrator but I feel like I need to do more....I want the other participants of this program to be notified IMMEDIATELY that their sessions where they talk about very difficult/painful things things that they don't like talking about are being used for training purposes and God knows what else.

29321,It’s been a terrible struggle the last few years. We have never asked for help from anyone though. We are hard working and we are proud of our family and who we are as people. It’s hard to ask for help. BUT- sometimes WE need help too.,Stress
29322,I do have intense anxiety to the point it affects my daily life and prevents me from performing the smallest tasks such as making a phone call to get an appointment. However I do not know if my anxiety is a result from what had happened to me as a child or me experiencing unpleasant experiences in highschool. I just know that my rape makes my anxiety worse sometimes. I do get triggered by anything that reminds me of unpleasant memories of my rape. The only time I break down is when I am severely distressed or my feelings are so bottled up that a trigger would set me off crying.,Stress
29325,I had another friend come out and tap on my window scaring me. He didn’t know what happened and when he asked me what was wrong I just started to cry. I felt stupid and ashamed. Through the sobs I told him what happened I even told him that my rapists did it to me. He was supportive and sweet and it made me feel so much more guilty.,Stress
29326,I've been trying to act like nothing happened but I can't stop thinking about all this. I feel weird that i'm even thinking about it so much. I should just brush it off. Everyone keeps telling me I should go for it. Even my guy friends which I assumed would agree with me feeling gross about all this.,Stress

29329,I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that. She asked me some basic questions and then suggested that I go into walk-in counseling that my school offers because she doesn't want to waste MY time being there. I told her that it wasnt a waste of my time and that I'm here because I want to get better. This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide. She acknowledged the fact that I wanted to stay and talk about other things in therapy but she proceeding to rush me out.,Stress
29331,Long story short the alternator + module + radiator is going to cost $500 to repair. After bills are paid we only have $550 monthly for groceries and necessities.

29350,The real irony is that had my dad told the truth about the car he would be home right now plotting his next scheme but instead he lied and got caught because of his arrogance. The problem we face now is that there is always the chance my dad might sign the documents and they let him out (he'll probably weasel money out of his youngest brother/my uncle to pay the bail) and then we have to contend with the possibility my dad has something else planned to get us which he probably does because that's his gig and his only goal in life since his big revelation after the pace maker got put in. My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses and he can't have any communication with my mom either. Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind but given how my dad operates I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm. I have an appointment with doctor Doorstall this thursday probably won't get anywhere but I'm sure he is aware of my dad's situation by now or will be soon.,Stress

I take his insults in stride as best as I can because I feel like I deserve it. He tells me that he “has no respect for me” and I am “nothing but a mistake” and he tells me that I am trash I do not deserve anything that I have and that I am just a waste of his time.

29361,Anxiety kicked in but then heightened by all the fucking coffee I drank from working before the meet. I started shaking I couldn't lift my head up. My girlfriend and I stepped out for a smoke and I told her the situation the guys moved away... they were hot too so thanks to my anxiety I missed out yet again on another golden opportunity. But once we got back to our seats I told my girl that I recently got close to that I had anxiety and the symptoms just casually because at this point its just a thing I have to tell people but this time it wasn't to a fellow artist or designer she was a nurse. Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that she asked me further questions.,Stress
29362,It was all so quick and I try and recall now what happened and my brain jumbles up the details but he finally realized what he was doing to me and stopped. I am a small girl with a very thin build at 5'8 and 125 to 130 pounds maximum and he is a big guy at 6'5 and and 265 pounds and I had no chance of getting him to stop. He started immediately after hysterically crying because I started to hysterically cry and started to feel like I couldn't breath. He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go.

Now at 30 years old I went to a therapist. I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because it’s as if I’m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me.,Stress

Ended up losing contact with everyone but the one friend I could talk to maybe once or twice a week for a couple hours. She'd try to keep me apprised of stuff going on with folks and those phonecalls ended up bring the spark that bloomed into us being a couple but... It wasn't enough.

Once she goes into an anxiety spiral I'm completely at a loss of what to do apart from hold her and stroke her hair.

I havent seen her since this happened and Im due back at uni next week.,Stress
29442,Some examples: spit on me randomly in the eye doctor's office giggled and strolled off when I looked up at him in horror. We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow. And he would often have a gleeful look on his face after he was done. For the longest I didn't know this was abuse nor did I know I had developed all of these poor coping mechanisms to deal with being abused. He ruined my life without me even being aware.,Stress

29449,Anyway our talk basically went nowhere and she said she absolutely will not stop hanging out with the group. I didn’t tell her to but I did tell her that it hurts me that she would engage with people who apparently have so many negative things to say about me and I thought blood was thicker than water. Really it’s her callous “yea I see you’re in pain but I don’t care get over it” type of standpoint that’s hurting me the most. I’m starting to think she too participates in the trash talking and I’m thinking of cutting her off too. Should I?,Stress
29451,But this incident has been troubling me for a couple of days now. I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships.

29452,"He brought me to hang out with the two of them a few times. I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship this is another thing I'm still thinking about. My best guess is that my ""touchy"" ness comes off as flirting and he thinks I'm trying to take him from her? I do casually say things like ""I love you"" a lot too which just worsens it from that perspective. This is sorta horrifying to think about because I have absolutely zero romantic interest in him at all and the reason I valued our friendship so much in the first place was because there was no romantic/sexual element.",Stress
29454,For the dog at least I can get stuff for cheap dog food or something but the cat we'd need cat food. All of this weighs on my mind.

29456,I can't tell if that's me being a toxic person or not and I feel guilty for feeling relieved. We were such good friends once but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years. My anxiety has muddied the waters and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault. Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me. Maybe I should have been the one to grovel because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.,Stress
29457,I didn’t sleep that night and eventually was fine. Since then my anxiety has gotten worse- scary movies linger in my thoughts a little longer. I’ve had a few mini panic attacks. I can’t get intoxicated anymore Bc I don’t like my mind being In a different state. I feel like a darkness is over me and I just feel scared all the time.,Stress
29460,A emotional turning point for me was at 16 my dog at the time a Lovable and super friendly Labrador who was about 3 years decided to wander out the gate and explore when he drove in after work one evening. It was a freezing cold night i remember. Ge had tried calling for our Lab to no avail as our lab was exploring down the road. My father (i hate saying that!) Started getting very angry furious even.,Stress
29461,He saved me from my family. I don't want to give up on him because he's never given up on me. TL;DR: Boyfriend often has tantrums where he throws objects around the room but never physically hits me. Is this abuse? How do I get help?,Stress
29463,I want to note that I told my husband that if he came to me and told me for his sanity he needed to leave I'd do it even if it was dumb for us monetarily. Nothing is worth him being tortured and putting pressure on our marriage. I think the reason we get by is because sometimes we can get away with once a day torture from my mother she also helps us a lot (especially me) and some days are ok. He just feels harassed and I understand this more than anyone because I feel the same way. .,Stress
29464,I hide my own set of keys. She tries to take her keys away from me and I refuse which turns into a full-blown fight. I have marks and bruises all over my arms and back as well as deep scratches from her fingernails. At one point she had me on the floor cornered on the steps repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand. I'm not saying I didn't retaliate but I only went to far as to push her away never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.,Stress
29467,The thought of leaving my folks behind would definitely not be good for me mentally. I've thought about basically living out of my car gym memberships to shower daily and laundromats to wash my clothes. Perhaps put all my stuff in storage and just keep working and save some money up. I live on long Island btw. Rent isn't cheap.,Stress
29468,Which forced me to acknowledge that I haven’t been performing to my own expectations. Enter the anxiety attack. Sobbing shaking fidgeting and rambling. To top it all off I threw away my xanex thinking that I didn’t need the safety net. I thought I was done with all this...reality proved otherwise.,Stress
29469,I live alone make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs I keep my apartment tidy I do my laundry I make sure I’m eating good I work out and I still hang with friends and such. Really the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I’m off. Even when I’m off I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though I’m good at getting this stuff done I still feel like there’s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don’t do MORE because I’m normally too tired to do anything else.,Stress
29470,I was nice and it got me no where so I was rude it got worse. I compliment my mom and my sister as much as I can I tell my sister I’m proud of her I tell both of them I love them I take care of my mom the best I can but I’m still their verbal punching bag. Every day I tell my mom that I love her that she looks pretty etc etc but it ends up in her replying with “you’re gonna fail this year you know that right? You need to do your school work”. My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of people’s interests and looks.,Stress
29471,Please don't make me feel worse. I mean hell I'm ashamed I even need to ask my boyfriend. But at least we have things to talk about and he's just naturally good at keeping me calm without even realizing he's doing it. He actually *helps* by being there. My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse.,Stress
29474,1. My father would abuse me consistently both mentally and physically from i think 4 to 14 maybe earlier. I don't really remember what all brought this on but often it was school related. I remember being in a car seat my mother didn't know what to do so she took me to him (my parents are apart) and i tried to run because i knew what was going to happen and i remember crying so hard i hyperventilated my mom promised never to do that again. He'd do it because of grades because i misbehaved.,Stress
29476,"I tell her this which falls on deaf ears. Next day we go to work things out. And I freak out when staff at the library call cops over us ""being loud"" I freak out over some very minor warrants. Which leads to her disappearing untill today when we have a meeting with a councilor. While waiting & the drop in center for the shower she assaults me & I block her blows.",Stress
29477,A LARGE portion of each of my check goes to making payments to this card but with the interest charges each month I budgeted and itll take me decades to pay it off and cost me thousands. I was in a tough spot jobless homeless and had to rely on the card but now I need to find options on how to pay it off or get a lower interest rate. I have heard of those advertisements about taking out a personal loan with a lower rate and using that to pay off the card then just paying the personal loan off are those viable options? What is my best option right now these interest rate charges are killing me and I can barely make ends meet. Any advice would be deeply appreciated,Stress
29478,im so scared of everything around me whenever I have a panic attack I can't even call out for help I just choke on my own breath and cry im just fearful of what's going to happen in the future. I'm already seeing a therapist but i've been relapsing so bad since september and i just don't know what to do it's been such a rollercoaster and it just feels hopeless to recover from this im sorry for bothering you guys i just need to talk.. everyone i can talk to is asleep and i wouldnt be able to talk to them even if I could i feel so numb after the panic attack i had last night i just.. Need a talk a distraction or something because right now I just feel so. wrong and out of place,Stress
29479,Hey guys I'm 31 moved to a new city with my wife for the first time back in October and am experiencing on and off anxiety for more or less the first time in my life. A couple quick questions: 1. How do I know whether I should see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?,Stress
29488,"At least 20 Ritalin 30mg maybe more (I've learned how to take many at once over the years of daily medication). I don't remember everything but i tried to lie to him and he had to drag me to the bathroom and tried to make me throw up. After a bit i realized what i was doing and tried myself. It didn't work. The scary thing is that when he went to call the ambulance and i thought i just might die i repeated to myself ""It's finally over"".",Stress
29490,Clearly he's hurting inside and I want to get him help but he refuses to get help because he denies he has a problem and blames it on everyone else. He then punches me as a result of this pushing me almost off my chair. I get up and push him away from me and so he picks up my workbooks and flings them across the floor. He raises his fist above his head and in defense I get the broomhead (not the broom - that's already been broken) to push him away from me. He then gets the broomhead and throws it down the corridor into my room with the door open.,Stress
29493,I'm soo lucky/blessed that I have parents with an open home to me so that I am able to do this but I can't keep going on like this. I feel afraid to work. I feel like less of a man because of this. I worry about my future and if I'll ever get stable ground. Sorry I needed to put my thoughts into text.,Stress
29495,He came home from who knows where and he walks in. I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried. He was mad i could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice. Next thing i knew he was behind me with his arm around my neck squeezing. He continued as he threw me on the couch and wrapped his legs around my stomach.,Stress
29496,I wonder about that night. Did you ever get past that night? Did you have other nights like that? Did anyone ever ask if you were okay? Do you forgive me?,Stress
29497,I thought they’d give me another date to come back or put me on probation but that did not happen. They told me I wouldn’t be allowed back to my house until my court date in a MONTH. And even that is certain. Well I found a friend that I can stay with for another 2 days but after that I’m unsure of what to do. I’m currently unemployed don’t even have a license there’s literally no one I can stay with my parents are refusing to talk to me.,Stress
29498,"I don't have any point I'm just overwhelmed and want to give up. No one's going to read this long of a post anyway. I don't want to tell my therapist I don't want to go to therapy. It feels artificial and contrived and uneven. When I google all this shit the internet is like ""That's the ptsd talking.""",Stress
29503,"Today was a horrible day from the get go and I had to call out because I cant function with other people (I work in retail) today so I claimed I had a fever. Of course it had to be memorial day weekend making it one of the worst times for this and they even of course said over the phone ""Well this really puts us in a bind"". Now I'm absolutely paranoid that they'll find out or they hate me now or I'll get fired for this. I'm so paranoid I'm worried they'll see me or come to my house to check on me even though I know they would never do that. I just wish someone could understand or sympathize/empathize with me for once.",Stress
29505,It's sick and twisted. I've been getting nauseas and I've been having more dissociative flashbacks. My nightmares are coming back but they're mostly of his parents. I'm afraid to see them although my dreams are usually them telling me they understand. That they're not mad at me for going to the police.,Stress
29508,We've talked about it before and she said that it's not like that and she cares about me alot and all that but at the same time these type of things keep happening. I truly feel that she does care and doesn't mean to neglect me but its just frustrating. If I keep saying something I'll look like a bad guy thats trying to ruin her friendships which is not what i'm trying to do. She's going to tell her friends what I say and they're probably going to think i'm trying to get her away from them. **tl;dr**: Girlfriend is having trouble balancing friendship and relationship,Stress
29509,A few weeks later i found out that he had had a long term girlfriend the entire time. I felt like such an idiot when I found out. He reached out to me last month and I told him I knew he had a girlfriend the whole time and that if I ever saw him again I would literally break his nose. I'm still furious about it. I'm angry that he thinks he pulled one over on me and that he got away with it.,Stress
29512,Trauma changed the trajectory of my life. But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded. My ex and I broke up because he never liked to leave the house even for daytime activities. I wonder sometimes how I am going to feel when I hit middle age. Am I going to feel like I do now?,Stress
29513,If I ask her anything about her life or about my uncle who she lives with (66 stroke survivor) she answers vaguely “He’s fine” or “ask him yourself”. The unappreciative part come from the fact that when she asks me to do something and I have to say no or if I imply a no she gets completely mad at me. She’ll go “but I love you and do stuff for you. Your daddy would be disappointed in you. Fine then I’ll never ask for anything ever again.,Stress
29515,But how do I keep going with this girl and eventually ask her to hang out again because no romantic relationship can really progress forward until we're physically intimate with each other but we can't get there unless we hang out. And she doesn't even like talking on the phone and just texts. I feel like I'm having a relationship with my phone sometimes and it's like a female Wilson sometimes lol (movie Castaway reference for those who don't know). Anyone who has been in an abusive relationship and came out of it or anyone who dated an abused survivor how do you advise that I progress things with her? \*\*TL;DR\*\* I'm dating a girl who was formerly in an abusive relationship.,Stress

29520,But then i couldn't think straight. now i get flashbacks in school. I used to enjoy quantitative courses but now i get tension headaches from the flashbacks and feelings of horror and hyperarousal. I just feel so violated and disturbed that it was for fear of his violence that i didn't close the door - and that he was watching me! My vagina feels tension too which i read from a PTSD book is a common symptom.,Stress
29521,They would text and call constantly throughout the day begging me to forgive them for hurting me but that they're in love and love can't be stopped. They got increasingly angry and started calling me selfish for trying to keep them apart. After I wrote a bit about the sexual abuse in an anonymous online diary my ex (who knew my username but I thought I had blocked from the site) started harassing me more. Angrily telling me that I need to stop pretending he raped me and how I wanted everything that happened and that I was just a jealous ex. I won't and kinda can't (remember missing pieces of time) go into all the details but he gaslighted me pretty bad.,Stress
29523,This has *obviously* created some crushing tension in the apartment with no one really having to go other than work during the day. (We've all recently moved to the area and don't really have family/mutual friends to stay with.) Flash forward to last night...I'm asleep on the couch and she comes in at 1AM blackout drunk shakes me awake violently to tell me of the Tinder date she just got back from and how awful it was. But the guy she had sex with last night was pretty good etc. This goes on and on turns to threats of violence against me for uprooting and throwing her life into whack.,Stress
29524,Sometimes I'll stop and just stand somewhere or stare until I get snapped out of it. I don't know for how long but it can't be for more than 10 minutes. I just found out about catatonia and I show a few other symptoms. When I dissociate it's usually a lot more violent and delusional so I thought maybe it was something else. I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I just had a meeting with her before learning about this am I just looking too deep into things?,Stress
29525,I have no worth or identity or breathe. He has blamed me for everything. I guess I am getting an abortion. I was upset his friend brought him somewhere that he ran into a girl he loves and even though it was just a second it really hurt me. He hides me from his friends and his friends reject me but all he says is I do not like his friends.,Stress
29530,Friends privy to the situation believe that she is just constantly keeping me on the back burner because I'm the safe option when she isn't with somebody or when she doesn't have anybody else. She knows I love her still she knows I'd do just about anything for her and want to be with her still to this day but nothing more than just an option. I always end up feeling the same in this situation though worthless low wishing I was in a relationship with her. - **tl;dr**: Me and ex have stayed in somewhat constant contact for 10 years never get back together officially.,Stress
29531,I only get it when I have a flashback or strong reaction to a trigger. I notice it sticks around even when I feel emotionally calm and can stick around for a long time after the trigger like days or weeks. It’s a new symptom I think. Also been having lots of nightmares again recently. Not sure what to do as I’m not currently in therapy but I am waiting to be seen at a mental health clinic.,Stress
29532,I go through periods where all night I have nightmares and I can’t slee because of them. These periods last for weeks or months on end and then stop briefly. Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares I can’t remember the name though. It was a really old blood pressure medicine from the fifties that they gave to soldiers returning from war and they figured out that it helped with ptsd too. But it made me so tired.,Stress
29533,"I've applied to many other places over the months and using services like Indeed and Monster. But no such luck as of yet. The whole issue has left me feeling angry. When I talked to my therapist about it he did help; however the conversation had the tone of ""being a man"" and doing what you need to do and after a while to simply let go of the anger. I'm not trying to disregard him but I've been having a hard time understanding what he means.",Stress
29535,I suffered a concussion a month ago and I noticed it really has provoked my anxiety to be scared about getting worse and it has even led to me getting depressed and thinking of harming myself I have been like this before I have had anxiety but not to this level. I have felt better since the concussion has healed but I am worried I won't recover from my anxiety and I have been perscribed Celprix (Escitalopram) and unsure if I should take it. I kind of feel like I can recover from this by getter back to my routine and return to work. Anyone else been through a life changing injury and had some bad anxiety from it?,Stress

29537,We've been living in my grandmother's house since loosing the apt. All of our possessions as well as all of my grandmother's possessions were in the home at the time of the fire. The property was supposed to be sold on December 29th but when my cousin who was also living on the property unexpectedly passed away on December 24th the buyers backed out. Due to these circumstances our home insurance had lapsed so at the moment we have no resources to work with except for the generosity of others. It's a massive tragedy for our family because we didn't have any funds available for Christmas either and between family and friends we were able to have a great holiday but now all of those gifts are gone as well.,Stress

29540,Unfortunately money is what me and her don't have now. My friends' help has dried up and I don't blame them one bit for that. After five months I've exhausted pretty much all the friends I can.

29541,"This post was spurred by the fact that I was just scrolling through photos I took of my boyfriend last year and I found myself thinking ""is this person actually my boyfriend?"" I don't mean that in a sappy ""how did I get so lucky"" way (although I did luck out with him for sure) but more in a ""how do I see this person all the time and still feel like I don't recognize him in photos"" way.

Normally I only do this with people from high school many of whom I haven't seen since we graduated six years ago.",Stress
29542,He hasn't paid any child support. He isn't fulfilling the courts orders that would get him a chance to petition for supervised visitation. It feels like he's completely just disappeared from being a father but I still feel like he's going to come back. Even writing about it makes it hard to breathe. Is it silly?,Stress
29548,"and ""how could you let me do this?"" Although my family and friends will never see this I'm here to answer the question: ""why?"" It wasn't as simple as some of my friends may think.

I didn't pass out this time. He went upstairs and slammed his door and locked it. I got right up and ran up the stairs and told him to let me in to get my shit so I can go. He told me to leave and I started kicking the door and demanding he lets me into get my shit so I can go.,Stress
29552,That freaked me out. I was tired after probably from a sugar crash and I immediately assumed I was going through a calcium OD and was going to end up in a coma.

Mind you he has NEVER cheated or even acted interested in other girls.,Stress

TL/DR: Abusive relationship led to a violated protection order. The subsequent criminal trial has made me question my emotional stability and memories. Are the symptoms of CPTSD causing me to fail in my interactions on a day to day basis or has there simply been a bizarre miscommunication?,Stress

29566,I'm new to Reddit and have only really discussed my issues with trauma and PTSD with my partner and therapist and I am struggling with the random dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization. And I'm so tired of it. I've been in therapy for half of my life. I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues but it never feels like enough. So I started talking to myself (which I do under stress) and drinking and this was a piece of the conversation:,Stress
29571,I feel like I'm letting this take over my life I'm constantly worried about what if is more then just anxiety. I went to the university psychiatrist after a 15 min talk he gave some pills and he book the next consultation for a mouth later. The psychologist is impossible to book because is full. My parents are away they worry so much they want me to come home I live 5 hours away from them (this includes flying). I just don't know I feel really insecure about all of this.,Stress
29572,My bank didn't notify me at all though a lot of the transactions happened outside the country. I currently have about $8 to my name from my savings which has since been overdrawn. I have been looking for a new job staying at this one because I have a good boss and because it pays above minimum wage. People effortlessly walk all over her and though she gets mad about it company policy as well as her personal precedence has really tied her hands. I'm one of about three reliable people and get saddled with the shifts no one bothers to show up to.,Stress
29573,I know it’s terrible and selfish and obviously people can be friends with each other but I just miss having a really strong and healthy friendship with another girl the way that we did. I want to have a good weekend but it feels impossible now and I want everyone there to have a good weekend and I don’t want to make it bad. I don’t know what to do. So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I don’t know why I’m overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself. It’s just I want to be better not just for other people but for myself too.,Stress
29575,I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today. That was the scariest part. It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know. But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he of all people will change.,Stress
29581,"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show instead of sharing that he was saw me he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending it'd be easier to come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",Stress

I had a pretty scary time with a friend of mine last night. He invited me around for a few beers and maybe two drinks in he asked if I'd be down to have sex.,Stress
29585,He knows that I'm still on the fence about pot and without me even asking promised me that he would not do it. But last March while he was gone he got extremely drunk and ended up smoking. He got extremely sick and ended up vomiting and passing out on the bathroom floor of their bus and called me the next day and told me everything. This was extremely difficult for me to process.

Unable to relax after work constantly thinking/dreading going to work. Get random mood swings about it either intensely rageful or wanting to burst in to tears.

29594,Rarely I forget about the symptoms. Rarely they don't bother me but they still are occurring always. I have seen two different doctors about this. They ruled out a few things and suggested that it was purely anxiety and that I go on an SSRI. I have not gone on an SSRI yet however I am planning to do so ASAP.,Stress
29596,I’ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and he’s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes. I’ve already endured years of his psychological abuse and him physically raping me in the ass while we were together. I’ve already endured seeing him and the fact that he brings another man that raped me (and he knows it) to every hearing so far. I’ve endured him harassing our old mutual workplace and every individual mutual contact we had when it first fell apart. I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him.,Stress
29597,I (30F) married my husband (31M) about 6 months ago after dating for 2 years and knowing each other for about 14. When we first hooked up I had a very successful career in the adult industry and I supported him for almost 2 years before he got a job. He knew what I did before we hooked up because I had been in the industry for years and everyone back home knew. He told me multiple times that he accepted it and he loved me regardless. However He has been very abusive always blaming it on my job before and now that I have retired since our marriage he uses my past against me during every fight.,Stress

I almost died twice thanks to him.

29600,He forced me into sex again... And if I refused he became violent. Once I had mentioned to a friend how I hadn't wanted sex and hoped that jacking off would be good enough and having overheard this my punishment was to be slammed into the wall and the table then thrown to the floor. When I pushed him back telling him to quit he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe... I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out which he never did and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up letting me escape and he'd hold her hostage letting me spend most of the night in the cold out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets. If he felt sober enough he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...,Stress

We figured the lower cost of living would offset the vastly lower minimum wage and we'd be fine. We both got jobs at her old workplace (Wendy's never go to the Lakeland Highlands Wendy's so many healthcode violations btw) and worked for two months and got fired for bs reasons (I got trained wrong and wasn't told about 60% of my responsibilities by a guy who was on his phone 75% of the time and quit a week later she overslept and no call no showed one day and got immediately taken off the schedule),Stress

I heard the break in and woke my dad and his new girlfriend up [my dad has had a lot of women in his life....] saying dotty had broken in. I had seen her from the balcony of our stairs when getting my dad. Had i not been up My dad had thought I had broken a cup or something and wasnt going to bother checking I was known for having insomnia at this point in my life already so she may very well have attacked any one of us that night.,Stress
29709,he could not understand why i resented him when in his mind it was ME who was being 'abusive'. because i couldnt fake being into sex with him which made me a 'bad girlfriend' because i wasn't ecstatic about always having to take on every responsibility and basically take care of him as if he were a child. he constantly told me that i was just playing the victim when it reality it was really him who actually was the victim. i was the 'bad person' in the relationship. WELL FUCK YOU.,Stress
29710,I can’t stop sweating the second I cough up phlegm there is immediately more and I’m like gagging on it my nose is stuffed and I have to actively try to breathe I feel so uncomfortable I’m losing my mind. I’ve hit my breaking point and I’m just sobbing uncontrollably. I’m stressing because I’ve already had to use sick time at work this year and it’s only the first week the house is covered in all of my sick germs and I don’t have the strength to disinfect it the laundry is piling up and the house is messy. I probably sound like an absolute baby right now but I can’t do multiple days of being incapacitated. I feel like shit and can’t do anything I need to get done.,Stress
29714,My current bf does not care about guy friends and trusts me to not put myself in a precarious position. When does this feeling of guilt go away? I cant spend the rest of my life working and spending time at home away from other people. The level of anxiety is near panic attack and occasionally leads to one to the point where I dont eat and barely sleep for days. TL;DR: feeling guilty over nothing from being conditioned in a previously abusive relationship.,Stress
29715,We are in need of immediate help and I dont know where else to turn. I have recently suffered major nerve damage that has severely diminished the use and mobilty of my arms and causes insufferable pain in my neck shoulders & arms and in turn cost me my long time position with Apple. We are now 3 months behind on rent and we have less than a week to come up with the money or the landlord will be foreclosed on and we will be evicted. And we have nowhere to go. Here’s a bit behind our predicament.,Stress
29717,I want him to die because then we'll be truly safe. But I don't want him to suffer. There have been times when I did. And I denied that there was ever any love because that was easier than accepting that a man who once loved his family decided he hated them so much he wanted to kill them. I've still got half my life to lead.,Stress
29718,This is all 1 days worth of stuff and it’s not even everything but this has been going on for months. My mum says she doesn’t know what to do with me that I’ve always been mildly anxious but it’s just completely spiralled out of control since Christmas time. Also I can’t sleep I’m getting 5 hours ish a night and I used to get 8 hours everyday. I don’t know what to do whether I’m justified going to a doctor or I’m just being stupid and making people with real anxiety and other mental illness look bad I feel like I’m being stupid and I hate my personality.

29727,Hello As is probably always the case I have no idea how to start this post. My girlfriend of the past year asked me to sit and talk to her yesterday where she opened up and told me how the relationship had run its course and how there was no chance it could be saved. I have known something wasn't quite right for a while and should have made efforts to make changes long before now. We are still going to remain friends as best we can until the tenancy on our flat runs out.,Stress
29728,Unfortunately with the way things have worked out this month I am left with little cash until my SSDI is deposited a week from Friday. And normally I’d say I’d just wait until then to take my dog Kane to the vet but he has developed a little bit of a cough and he doesn’t seem as active as he normally is (<2yo chocolate lab so he should be pretty active). I called the vet and they suspect it could be heartworms so while I have the $50 for the office visit I don’t have the $45 for the test. Any help towards this would be greatly appreciated. I can pay back but as sad as it sounds I might have to make it in a couple payments as I’m on a fixed income.,Stress

Then on 10/15 my mother was rushed to the hospital for a seizure.,Stress
29733,But then I get angry so quickly and I feel terrible because I snapped at someone who didn’t deserve it and I just don’t understand where it comes from. Or I’ll suddenly start thinking about what happened to me and I’ll get really really depressed again out of nowhere. One minute I’m functioning okay and the next I seem like someone else. I don’t know if this is a symptom of my PTSD or if there’s something else mentally wrong with me that’s being piled on top of the PTSD. I was just recently diagnosed so I guess I’m still trying to figure out what’s the PTSD and what’s just me losing my mind.,Stress

29739,He also talked very condescendingly to me and the other female servers as well as being a total arse in general. I wanted to say something SO badly but by the time I worked up the courage he took her arm and led her to their car. Also I didn't want to make things worse for her by sticking up for her in public. I wrote down their license plate number and car model but I did not get the chance to see the name on the card he paid with. I really want to reach out to this woman.,Stress
29740,But I could feel construction workers staring at me. I know I might be paranoid but I don’t want to take chances anymore I’m scared. I already paid for a year at the gym (about 6 months ago.)

I know some Korean and am studying Japanese Chinese and Spanish (self taught). The only things of value that I have anymore are my phone and laptop that I've had since I ran away and I mainly use the wifi at work to access the internet.

It is legally without a doubt my fault although actually not because the cops cut the guy in front of me off to let some school busses go past without traffic or whatever the roads were slick and I couldn’t stop in time but I’m still freaking out in my head. Ugh. Mentally just not alright right now. I should not have gone out today.,Stress

Doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me I had to have it removed till the actual day. She just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth.

In fact it seemed like we were all having a great time. But I'm having a hard time shaking my worry that I acted like an idiot or something.

I feel like I can't stay with part time work because all my friends and family expect me to get back to full time work ASAP and feel like I'm not moving forward in my career otherwise. Everyone keeps telling me to just give it a chance it'll all work out but I'm not sure what to do/think. Advice on what to do about work and how to calm down enough to sleep tonight and how best to manage everything going forward?,Stress
29832,Why is this the hardest month? Is it that the nerves have cleared minute by minute anxiety calmed hopelessness resolved and now I have to sit a grieve a person I made up in my head?

29833,Hello. As you can tell by the title I'm concerned about this little girl across the street. She's able to walk and talk but I don't think she's even 5 yet. From what I've witnessed the four years I've lived in this house the home she lives in is not at all suitable for her as a developing child. Her parents are constantly screaming at each other in the street and the girl is bawling as her mom commands her to get into her car so she can take her wherever.,Stress
29837,"We've been getting along very well and our previous repeated complaints on both sides of ceased because of this. But as time has gone on my feelings have changed in regards to me thinking I can accept this and work through it with her. I know I love her and I don't really know how to explain my emotions here but I no longer feel like ""her husband"" and I don't feel like she's ""my wife"" it's more like we're partners or room mates or something. I feel a vital part of our marriage (loyalty and trust) is gone and it can't come back. In the end I can't shake the thoughts of leaving and restarting my life.",Stress
29838,I only realized this was a stupid idea in my freshman year of college when I started having flashbacks. I tried once more to do therapy and almost failed out of school. Again I buried it all to be dealt with at a more convenient time. I have now been working in a job that don't mind for the last year and 3 months. I found that November and December were a struggle and because of that I planned to address my stuff by going to therapy starting in 2019.,Stress
29842,A few days before Valentine’s Day someone sent me screenshots of him talking to a girl on FaceTime or Instagram saying “you’re so cute” and flirting with her. I decided not to say anything- the girl lived in another state and I didn’t want to bring it up. I figured she was a fried from when he had hitchhiked across the country when he was in college. I waited till Valentine’s Day and called him up- he told me “I don’t think we should live together and I just signed a 9 month lease at my apartment.” I was livid. He brought me 2 dozen roses and I smashed them in front of him in a parking lot.,Stress

I do 90% of the cooking and cleaning in the house. I try my best to make sure his needs are met even if it means that my needs fall short almost always. It seems like any ""everyday"" argument we have about something always turns into me being a piece of shit because of what I did to him. He tells me that I made him this way and I need to deal with it until he moves past it which I understand and agree with.",Stress
29844,My anxiety and ocd have been terrible the last few weeks. I've recently started drinking again (stupid I know) and I'm feeling like I need to use it as a crutch again.

I have been having the worst sinus and headache flare ups.,Stress

I realize this isn’t the most pressing serious or dramatic post on here but I stick my hand out in the hopes you can give me some guidance some past experience wisdom or advice on what I can do or try so that the “here and now” are in question and not “then and there” so that my confession can go along without regret.,Stress

I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but again knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long knowing that it made her uncomfortable knowing that it was escalating and then it was actual happening and her not saying no. I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions. I can absolutely see him pressuring her once her not knowing how to respond when it happened and then her saying ""This is BS I'm out"" afterwards. But that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.",Stress
29854,How about that? No this isn't just some edgy teen oh I hate my dad I have every reason to hate him for what he has done and continues to purposely do to me and my family.

29862,I of course understand her wanting me to be safe but I have an IUD and use condoms 100% of the time which she knows because she pries about my sex life. She knows I'm sexually active and I don't have a boyfriend and is really judgmental about me having casual sex. I had a pregnancy scare last week (I'm not pregnant) and all I wanted was some advice from my mom and she used it as a way to make me feel bad about my sex life. When I was younger she would constantly slut-shame me for things I hadn't even done and made me feel so guilty about the idea of even having sex that I didn't have sex even with my year-long high school boyfriend because of this crippling guilt. Whenever we argue she makes it a time to critique my entire personality and not just my behavior in that argument or even within my relationship with her.,Stress

But I only want my boyfriend he has a shy personality but he’s very knowledgeable he’s like a walking Wikipedia and I love him so much. He makes me feel calm just laughing at our inside jokes receiving a cute text from him and ever since being in a relationship with him I’ve grown to be happy with the smallest things in life. But he never seems to be able to move on from the event from his past or he‘s just deeply affected by his depression and negative thoughts also all the stress from his studying in university and family really is a big problem. All of this really took a toll of our relationship to the point that we hardly called anymore or had any communication.,Stress

29869,Its hard knowing that everyone around you doesn't have these issues It's hard that it takes an extreme amount of work just to make a normal day in life go by smoothly(which it almost never does) At first I felt like I had a grasps on this whole PTSD thing because it made sense when I first got diagnosed but the longer it's been the harder this is to deal with. Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off? this is the answer I give when people ask me what's wrong because there's always more than one thing going on at the same time.

29877,Something like that happened again. He was angry with me and wanted me to go to another room so he didn't have to look at me but I wanted to stay (not getting involved in any conflict or anything just doing my studying and not interacting) so he took me out of the room by force not hard again but I got hysterical nonetheless. After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going. In about an hour he came to me and it looked like his anger was unresolved as he was provoking me. I decided not to get involved because this time I was genuinely frightened of what was going on.,Stress

29884,Recently my anxiety has gotten really bad possibly the worse it has ever been and I’ve been experiencing panic attacks but I still can’t justify taking my medication because I feel like I deserve to suffer. I also struggle with the feeling like I’m making all this up and none of my problems exist which I know rationally cannot be true when I’ve struggled with this for most my life however I still can’t shift it. I don’t know if this is part of my anxiety making me feel like this or whether it is another thing I’ve made myself believe. I guess I’m just looking for some advice and reassurance. I’m just really tired of feeling this way and constantly being in turmoil with my mind.,Stress

This resulted in being given a crumpled unapologetic five-pound note. No sorry nothing said just the silence and dark stair.

29966,Not sure why but I’m really off today. I can’t stop feeling like a screw up even though I’ve really done nothing wrong today.

I just feel useless and unlovable. I have convinced myself even my husband doesn’t like me.,Stress
29967,It wasn't a trap (like wth?) and I just couldn't hide my emotions effectively.

29983,Has anyone else had this sensation? Also if I close my mouth so my teeth are close together I can tell that they are constantly chattering. I've definitely been much more anxious than usual lately as I work full-time at an emotionally challenging job and just decided to go back to school to pursue a Master's degree via night classes but this shaky sensation has been a little alarming as I can't tell if it is anxiety related or something worse (which certainly contributes to the anxiety!!).

I can't even remember how long this must have went on but soon enough I had decided to put my pillow on the other side of the mattress because he'd touch me when I sleep on my side. I thought putting my pillow on the other side of the bed will help because as I fall asleep and turn on my left side my back will be towards the wall and he won't be able to reach.

30001,(TW sexual abuse mentions) When I was 14 I was sexually abused regularly for 8 months resulting in PTSD and recently I realised that afterwards I completely changed how I looked.

I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing. I've never heard of anyone else doing this before though is this normal?,Stress

My plan was to get back to our parents for a while until we both earn a bit better or find a cheaper place. But unfortunately for her this is no option.

She blocks every attempt of mine to bring up the possibility of going back.,Stress

On the second last night she tells me she has kissed another guy and feels horrific about it. I tell her i'm going to leave because she has cheated in hope she realizes what life is like without me (stupid I know).

30035,He explained that he didn’t think it was such a big deal that he disclosed such personal information about me without my permission to his friends then he tried to flip it and said it was no different then a time I canceled plans with a friend and told them the reason was because he Tom was sick with the flu and I was going to stay in and take care of him. How is me honestly explaining that the reason I would have to cancel on a friend because my boyfriend is sick the same as him giving away very detailed information about our sex life plus other very personal traumas that I experienced without my permission? I feel like he’s trying to gaslight me and I’m seeing a side to him I’ve never seen. I’m honestly thinking about ending things with him over this.

30069,He's been violent pretty much since 6months in. Nothing too horrendous at first just a slap or a punch or he'd spit in my face during an argument or grab me. I reasoned I could deal with that because he was always so remorseful and depressed afterwards. A year in we split up because he stole my car keys out of the ignition got in the car and threatened to kill me rip out my hair and nails etc. I went to the police and they issued him with a domestic violence order.,Stress
30071,I created this gofundme as a way to help my mom pay our cats vet bills and because they all need to see a vet pretty badly. This is <url> . I don't know if it is overtly clear in the picture but he has a cyst under his eye and treating it at home isn't working anymore. My mom is still paying off the vet bills from almost a year ago when my oldest cat Honey needed emergency surgery. Honey Shea and my youngest cat Emily all need to see a vet pretty badly but cost is too much.,Stress
30072,The only truly good therapist I've been to was in Sweden she listened took extensive notes remembered stuff and didn't talk about herself or her personal life. I need to see a therapist but I don't know what to do. I can't teach my therapists how to do their job nor should I feel like I need to in the first place. I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart. It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help.,Stress
30073,Hi I'm a senior in high school and I just turned 18. While at school one day my mom collected some of my belongings and put them in a bag by the door and then confiscated my house key telling me I had to leave by the next morning. I have no where to go no car and no access to my savings. I have a part-time job but it auto-deposits into a checking account that my dad has control over.,Stress
30075,I'm starting to really believe that my brain is the problem here and not trauma. Everyone just thinks I'm a dramatic slut anyway so does it even matter? Like maybe they are right? I feel like I'm too embarrassed to even go back to my psych now. Today I seriously looked like a total basket case.,Stress
30076,I was just going to bail the next morning and not come back but I called the cops to come get me that night that how unsafe I felt. I feared for my life. Please people I need to get a job and some type of place to stay. In Florida. Shelters do more harm than good,Stress
30081,I'm 21 and have been on Lexapro for about 2 years. Was diagnosed with GAD the same time I was put on medication. Just graduated this past May from college (I had the worst anxiety of my whole life during my last semester) and I have been doing well since graduation. I started working the graveyard shift a month ago at a non-profit and the anxiety hit me like a big wave about a week ago. Just all of a sudden out of nowhere.,Stress
30084,"Today i came home from and the girls were up and had the Halloween candy all over the room. Their dad was sleeping alongside them. After a couple minutes of ""bitching"" he says to my oldest tell your mom to shut up. And so she does. So i get on top of him and i say don't you ever do that again.",Stress
30085,He is not allowed to show up and cause a scene like that and he definitely isn't allowed to talk to a child like that handicapped or not. So yes I'm moving. My brother is having panic attacks now he shouldn't be afraid to be at the house. The only thing is finding a house on such short notice is proving to be very difficult. We have some blemishes on our rental history from past problems but have gotten to a much better place since then.,Stress
30087,When you can’t remember the simplest things but your mind is racing a thousand miles a minute you know it can’t go on. It felt like my sanity was whirling away from me. So I arrived in what I remember to be a thatch of poisonous thorns ripe with painful tearful memories. Instead I have been given the give of honestly looking and starting to deal with the damage of deep scars. Today instead of jumping on the operating table eager to right the very wrong right foot I got to take a bike ride.,Stress
30088,When I was younger not even double digits another minor around my age came very close to sexually assaulting me. It luckily didn’t happen and my two cousins busted the boy’s door. Years later I couldn’t be around men without feeling anxious. I don’t remember having any nightmares but I couldn’t trust men. Not even my own father.,Stress
30089,This week has been bad. I'm crying over everything. I'm struggling at work to get basic tasks done. I am SO HEAVILY OVERWHELMED by the smallest things. My sink was so full of dishes to the point where I had no clean ones left and because the pile was so high I couldn't go near it and just cried.,Stress
30090,The few days following this I was a wreck an absolute mess. Crying at work shaking anxious sweating and couldn't eat. Through the week I wound up losing nearly 6lbs and have been everything from manic depressed to furious to scared out of my wits to utterly confused aaand all the way back around again. The other night I told him I needed an answer. WHAT are we doing?,Stress
30091,I think it’s possible that these feelings are coming from the fact that he has said he loves me while drunk but can’t say it sober. I haven’t brought his up to him but it makes me feel like he can’t say it because of his ex. Which I understand but it also makes me sad that he’s not excited to be in love with me. I think part of me also feels like a second choice or like I’m being compared to her. It’s eapecially awful when I think about how ready I would have been to to go back to my ex when I was still heartbroken.,Stress
30093,I desperately miss my childhood and I wish I could have it back. After being molested I feel that it was cut short. I'm afraid of getting older and getting to the age where l have less time left than I've already lived. I think about it every day and it consumes me entirely. I'm obsessed with extending my lifespan on one end and just killing myself on the other,Stress
30094,But I don’t know why I get this feeling. What can I do to stop feeling this way? I want to focus on me and my things without having to think about her and what she’s doing all the time so I can be less distracted and focused on my other priorities. TL;DR I want to focus on my priorities in life but I find myself getting wrapped up in my thoughts about what where and what my girlfriend is doing.,Stress
30095,Part of me wonders if it's not my mom's fine-tuned manipulation at work but it's sure as hell eating at me. How do I get out of his harmful headspace? It feels like my emotions and my logic are at war right now. Even after the abuse and trauma I've endured at the hands of my mom I still question the validity of my experience because I know there are people that have it a lot worse. And seeing that video was like watching a train wreck it made me feel so awful because of its violent nature but it also made me doubt a lot of what I'm still experiencing.,Stress
30096,Everytime he gets mad he takes my phone or other items away from me and tells me he bought it so it's his. He's even broke my iPhone which I bought a long time ago. He doesn't give me money and if I want some I need a good reason why. He works overnights which makes things very hard for me because the Long island railroad barely runs during those times and even then I have a 2months old where would the baby and I go overnight? I don't know what to do but I'm tired of feeling trapped and helpless.,Stress
30098,It’s subconscious for sure but just a feeling I get. I’m terrified of him and praying that he gets the real help he needs at the same time. And I just don’t know how to sort that out. I don’t know how to stop worrying and wondering what he’s doing we have several court dates coming up so I think that adds to it. I’m just so exhausted and ready for this fight to be over.,Stress
30099,"But even after that he still says things that makes me feel uncomfortable. For example when I suggest we do something or go somewhere that could be somewhat unique/interesting (e.g. watching a documentary about sex workers in their 60s or going to a church in Vienna to listen to the choir boys sing) his first reaction via text is ""wtf?"" I instantly feel bad and angry because he is saying wtf to my plans and interests. When I confront him about it he says he ""wasn't saying it to me."" His excuse is that he was saying wtf about [insert whatever the subject matter was].",Stress
30100,I instantly thought of something I rarely think about being molested in a pool locker room when I was 10. My heart started beating incredibly fast as I readied myself to tell them the thing I couldn’t even tell my family at the time. I started crying something I haven’t done in years and something my friends have never seen me do. When it got to me with my hand over my eyes all I could say was “I don’t think I can”. It felt like I was reliving what I’d gone through like I could see it happening in front of me.,Stress
30103,I'm 26. Tuesday is day one of therapy. Day one of me trying to talk about whatever has been going on in my head for the last decade last 2 decades. I'm terrified to talk but tired of living like this. Tired of the nocturnal panic attacks tired of crying in the shower tired of not feeling in control of my head tired of the pointless thought circles that eat me up daily on something that doesn't matter.,Stress
30107,"I was terrified and scared and couldn't get away. She just said he was ""joking around"" but it was horrible. I get a sting of panic and fear if anyone pinches me today. I can't even use a lighter without fear of it (Fire is fine it's Just that kind of lighters). I also panic if anybody raises their voice or sounds angry.",Stress
30110,For example she told me I was too stubborn. This is definitely true but she criticized my political opinions my social behaviors and my pop culture opinions in addition to just my relationship with her. She also constantly mocks me when we fight literally repeating my words back to me in a childish/cartoony voice and putting words in my mouth. She refuses to listen to my point of view. We recently got into a fight where I thought a Christmas present my father had gotten me was cheaper than it was.,Stress
30112,"The misery is so much worse than pre-lamictal the torment is so much scarier. It feels almost demonic like someone outside of me is tormenting me (I do not mean this literally or psychotically it's just my subjective description). I have crying spells all day I mean the entire day doesn't matter who I'm hanging out with doesn't matter if I'm at work (I had to quit for the time being) doesn't matter if I'm working out. I shake and cry and shake and cry like wailing violent cries. It's terrifying it feels very ""chemical"" and out of control like the absence of the drug does this to me and it's scary for the people around me.",Stress
30123,I was able to get my old office job back and that comes with okay pay and good benefits I start November 1st . Just trying to take steps to make sure we’re okay before we get too behind and stuck on the streets . Anything is appreciated all I have 11$ to my name until Friday . Pm me you would like to help . I am starting a gofund me sometime this week to help us if anyone is interested in that I will keep you updated,Stress
30125,It sent me into a full-blown crisis by breaking open the “no one believes me and I’m worthless” wound. I had to up my level of care now I’m in IOP 5 days a week 3+ hours a day. It’s given me just enough relief to return to weekly EMDR. I had my first session in this round last week. It was the most physically symptomatic I’ve ever been in-session.,Stress
30127,"He doesn't have to spend a load of money on things I like! He can use it to spend on himself. I don't understand why he feels that just because we're in a relationship that he has to ""spoil"" me. I enjoy being spoiled but only when I'm the one spoiling myself haha. TL;Dr: My boyfriend doesn't like that I don't want him to do anything for me",Stress
30128,Sometimes I feel like I’m the third wheel in their relationship. And this doesn’t even include what they may do when I’m not around! Also whenever roommate will talk about boys or finding a boyfriend I notice husband will quickly try to shut that idea down fast and say he knows roommate isn’t attracted to said guy or doesn’t want/need a boyfriend. There’s definitely an emotional dependency there. I know my husband has explained to me over and over how much he helps her and how important he is in her life.,Stress
30131,"Whenever I have a reaction or meltdown he always tries to give shitty advice like ""just think about the things you're grateful for."" I'm sorry but in the therapies I've taken and in the books I have to help me nothing *anywhere* says anything about gratitude and it tends to trigger me when he says this because it's what my narcy mom would say to me. I tried to explain this and asked him to read my books and he got mad at me because in his mind I was trying to tell him what to do and I was being ""ungrateful"" for his help. I told him how important it was to me for him to read these books because it would help me feel more understood but he keeps coming up with excuse after excuse about why he doesn't want to read them. I just don't know what to do anymore.",Stress
30136,While sitting on my normally-quiet front porch today one of my unbelievably extroverted neighbors was carrying on the loudest conversation I've ever heard on a quiet street. Her conversation partners used a normal volume - she was the only one yelling words at the top of her lungs. I wanted to snap her clueless little head off. Or at the very least tell her to shut the f$*( up. Grumpy?,Stress
30139,My friends and family don't understand why he is so jealous and controlling because they know when I'm in a relationship I'm faithful. Im ready to take him out of my life but what should I do? When hes angry I don't know what extent he would go to. How should I handle it? Ignore him or communicate calmly so he doesn't get mad?,Stress
30141,Maybe kind of nauseous? Not in a normal nauseated feeling. Its more like that pit of my stomach I'm about to get in big trouble or I'm waiting for the cops to come pick me up or something haha. Like it has that prickle in my spine to it. And that restlessness in my head.,Stress
30145,I am just sick of this being my daily life. Between the derealization and the hypervigilance and paranoia even on good days I still don't feel like a person - and that's not even touching the flashbacks and nightmares. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't find a shrink who I trust or who seems equipped to help with the particular symptoms I have and that seems like my only option. What do I do?,Stress
30147,"I was in a rabbit hole of youtube videos over the weekend starting off from music videos then vine compilations and then somehow fight videos. On one of the side videos I noticed a video involving ""XYZ high school"" where my boyfriend attended. The video was actually pretty clear and my blood kind of ran cold when I realized one of the 2 kids in the video was my boyfriend. It was absolutely brutal. And there's no doubt that this was him.",Stress
30150,We went home the next day. And now i fcking dont know what to do. My heart rate feels like it’s shaking the whole bed. Im dying. TLDR i got friendzoned at the beach and I cant take it like a man,Stress
30153,For those that have sought help before is it as bad as I am imagining? Will I be taken seriously? I feel that because I put myself in that situation I sort of don't deserve help if that makes sense. I'm not even sure this is the right place to post as I'm not sure it's even a possibility to get some sort of ptsd from something like this. Sorry for the rambling and thank you for reading.,Stress
30154,He apologizes if I point it out later but the first instinct is always to blame me. And often the thing he's blaming me for is exaggerated and made to look like a routine flaw in me even if it's a once off thing. He doesn't hesitate to show his bad mood/displeasure (which applies to how he is around most people not just me but I think it's worse when it's about me). He doesn't hide it at all even if we're around other people so I have to be particularly cautious not to piss him off or bring up anything that could upset him in public. When he's upset/displeased in private he withdraws and it's up to me to grovel and convince him to talk to me again.,Stress
30155,After talking with my psych she made me realize that anxiety has been the route of my negative feelings and it was likely anxiety causing depression. Despite this however she never seemed to understand just how severe my symptoms were. I would try to stay calm and describe how i felt to the best of my ability however it wasn't until she saw me have an anxiety attack over asking her a \_very\_ simple question that she finally understood the severity. She said I seemed to downplay how I felt so I took this into account for future reference. Eventually I move on to starting antidepressants citalopram to start off.,Stress
30160,"I couldn't speak but finally managed to say ""Bag get my bag."" He was able to help me with my pills and touch me and talk to me enough that I came back. Now boyfriend is back to bed and I'm assuming I'll be up for the rest of the night. I don't know what to do with this. This is scary stuff.",Stress
30162,I am quite introverted and the broken friendship I had with my previous roommate made me feel very anxious so I moved into an apartment on my own. I love living alone but when I have severe anxiety attacks it becomes lonely and almost unbearable. I sometimes think so much that it feels like I am going crazy. I have terrifying thoughts and I make up scenarios in which I have some terrible condition or I am dying. My parents know that I have anxiety but never took it too seriously.,Stress
30164,She has not once shown disappointment. When she sees me get frustrated she lays next to me and holds me. Asks me what I need to relax. But it's becoming a self perpetuating cycle and I'm getting panicky that this is going to drive a wedge between us because she will start to feel that she doesn't excite me or satisfy me or whatever. Before anyone asks the pipes all work.,Stress
30165,This SUCKS we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it. I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship the excitement leading up to our trip and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)! This is the same anxiety that has stopped me before and I am NOT letting it stop me again. To anybody who's experienced this before what tips or strategies can you give me to help overcome it? TL;DR- Very anxious about upcoming trip because I'm afraid of being trapped/away from the comfort of my home to the point where it's affecting other parts of my life how do I get over the anticipatory anxiety so I can enjoy myself?,Stress

30170,Even when she hated me I didn't hate her. There weren't enough good friends in my life for me to afford hating her and there still aren't. I can't describe it.

She tried talking to me and I felt my entire body physically tense and I was just viscerally angry.,Stress

30177,Hey So I come from a middle class family and study far away from my parents for university (already scary for me as you can imagine). After going home this winter my parents dropped the bombshell on me that they are struggling to pay my tuition. The thing is although we are not super rich or anything my fathers work covers 80% of my tuition and housing the reason that my parents are unable to pay is that my dad is fairly disorganized and let his expenses build up. My tuition is due this friday and I just called my parents and woke them up to inform them that its getting really serious now (my dad promised to make an arrangement with his friend to pay my tuition).,Stress
30178,But then I'll get there and he'll drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and to be honest it totally makes me want to bail early. It's just annoying to be invited to come over and thinking you're gonna have some bro time gaming and what not only to get there have him drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and being stuck between either listening to 5th grade cheesy/cringeworthy convos or figuring a way to bail early without coming across as an asshole. How can I talk with my buddy in a polite way about the matter that when he invites me over I'd prefer it to be bro time without coming across as an asshole or that I'm against his GF as a person which I'm totally not! Again she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that. Thanks in advance!,Stress

This month as been very stressful between work and school and my mental health have just been deteriorating and because of that I’ve been more easily irritated. I get into arguments now with my gf everyday about the most mundane things. I am mostly at fault since I’m the one starting them I’ve just felt like nothing has been enough or certain things she doe’s irritates me. I don’t blame her for anything she has been the best partner ever and has been very supportive. I just can’t get a hold of my temper and I’m scared it’s gonna drive us apart.

48292,"University Degree Stress Hello I'm currently in my third year of university. Since the start I have been very stressed and at times had bad thoughts come into my head. I tried to talk to my parents about switching programs or go to university with less expectations (The University I'm going to is known to be brutal to their students). Sadly that didn't work which I understand from my parents side if I get through it then it will pay off. The next two years for me is just going to be quite scary as I'll be doing a Full Time course load in the Fall Spring and Summer for two years straight. Just ranting I guess and some sort of motivation would be nice honestly.School for me has always been a stressful topic and has never changed even in high school I'd say I've always been so anxious or stressed about the topic. Though what I can say is that once I do the two years at least I am out and finish my degree and I can move on from the idea of school. Just ranting at this point as this topic has definitely affected me a lot through out the years but this week it has affected me more than ever but I am now coming into terms that with the two year plan I got going it's not going to be that bad forever.",Stress
48293,Chronic stress help I really wish anyone can help me or i just wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same things i am because i havent found anyone who has. Im getting headaches/migraines every single day. Its been around 2 months now this isnt the first time this has happened to me it happened 2 years ago same thing. I had migraines every single day non stop for like a year straight to the point where i couldnt even eat and developed photophobia and couldtn even turn on my room lights or anything. So it eventually went away after a couple months but im back in here again. Doctors tell me that its stress/anxiety but it just doesnt make sense to me as to why it gets this bad to the point where i cant even get up from my bed or be awake for long hours before feeling pain no one gets it this bad for this long 7+ months NON Stop??? So it started around November with panic attacks and anxiety usually something triggers my anxiety and i can control it but no not this time it happens even when im happy out of nowhere i just feel bad all the time and super weak then it progressed to me feeling okay in the morning and bad at night i always knew id feel bad at night so i would do my daily duties during the day. Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off headaches everyday cant go out cant do anything i can barely even be on my phone lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back. I massage myself everyday i try to take medications but they all give me extreme side effects even tylenol. I know itll be a few months before i get better but i wish i knew more people that have gone thru this i even tried magnesium gummies and got side effects from those as well. Ive been doing so well with my anxiety and i try to feel okay and get distracted but the pain never ever ever goes away just gets worse and calms down please someone help!,Stress

48302,"Stressing about Studying I am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different University. The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. My stress levels are currently through the roof about this as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers who even though treated as adults at University still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is even though not permanent the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom so maybe not so bad. Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this but already having experienced this with not much success I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend but the way I have been treated in the past just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country so looking for anything else is currently out.Honestly I think I'm just stressing because I'm over 30 and feel like I still don't have my life in order with another future gap in my resume. Please tell me I'm going to be ok.....",Stress

48307,"Am I choosing the right mindeset? I wonder.. is it my stress time management or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano soccer and my grades with school. I love everything equally (well maybe except school..) but in the end my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. But here I am with a B- (84.5) in my history class and I need to get it to an A- (90.1) by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A- at least so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school but it'll benefit me a lot and as my school is very tough and competitive I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict being 87 years old he has his more ""older-fashioned"" and more ""understandable"" ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards but at the end of the day I keep telling myself. In the future there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements for the future to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.I've never gotten a B or a grade range in the B section (B- B or B+) throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid I usually sleep at 2-4AM waking up at 6AM with soccer practice 3-4 times a week (usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much) and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join Mock Trials which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy about 2-3 assignments new each period which is every day so in a week total about 30-40 assignments which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days or sometimes a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again there's at least 1-2 tests a week which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course there's also the projects and essays let's add about 1 for every other week. Should I take a break from piano or soccer and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade 84.5% up to a 90.1% at least which is \~6% of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this all I get in response is the same ""It'll be okay."" All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than ""it'll be okay"". I'm still new to the environment of high school and figuring out what fits for me and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement something I haven't heard in awhile is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.TLDR ; Not having the most decent grade in history class (84.5%) wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class I need at least a 90.1% for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities as well as school clubs should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me I'm able to do it and they have confidence in me. Thanks again.",Stress

48318,"I'm mad and sulking over a single bad date. I'm 28. Had 6 dates in my life. Never had sex before. Had 1 bad acquaintance that I needed therapy to deal with.I don't hate women. I don't think everything is pointless. I chat with coworkers but I don't have a lot of friends. Ladies seem to think I'm a nice person and funny. I don't have much trouble shamelessly asking someone out. I've long thought I have enough hobbies and interests and goals to keep myself mentally stable and preoccupied. Doesn't stop everyone from saying I'm a sweet guy who just needs to be more confident less sensitive and wait for the right person.I get flustered when I meet someone flirty or shameless but I play it off with self-deprecation and wit.I had a date with a coworker who was coming onto me frequently (poking me prodding me talking about bodily functions giving me looks and signs and thank yous took my phone number called me wishes me morning acts like she's out of breath around me talks about and asks me sexual questions talks about her dating history etc).She wanted to go to a Barne's and Noble's. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and she'd shown up an hour early to give herself a headstart.She stood next to me I comically volunteered to be pack mule and we sat and read books for a while talking in-between. She made a spa appointment at 4pm. I asked her what she wanted - 1) friendship 2) casual sex 3) a relationship. I wasn't good for 2 (no confidence).She described to me frequently about how much her previous relationships messed her up we talked indirectly our thoughts about romance and such.Her answer was 1 and she said she didn't know what the future hold.We left and I went to a Chic-filet she'd informed me was there. Then I drove home rather than wait the hour for her appointment to finish said I had fun and drove home listening to Drowning Pool and Foo Fighters.I got home played a video game laid down and fought back tears feeling every insecure and negative thought I've had about myself. This date was something I wanted and it felt like I came away with less than I started with. She said she'd text me later and didn't get around to it until much later and even though it was a short time I felt myself getting lonelier and madder because we just weren't having the initial flirty back and forth we did before the date.I turned my phone off.Everyone is going to tell me ""there's a million fish"" and she even said ""some people just don't vibe"" but the messages are just so unclear to me right now. This isn't too long after I broke up with someone who I felt like I did vibe with.I just can't see myself continuing to give this much energy toward meeting someone new another 5-00 times like everybody else. I'm a sensitive person. I feel drained and hateful of everyone that dating comes so easily to even though I know that's wrong. I'm so mad we didn't click its embarassing and I know it's not her fault. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't feel like exercising or doing anything positive. I just want to be angry.I guess I walked in expecting she'd throw herself at me and I'd have the chance to be a gentleman and be like ""hey I like you but I want to get to know you"" and she'd be like ""ah he's not just a desperate fuck he has character."" And well that didn't happen. Instead I feel like I got read and told politely I wasn't what someone was looking for. And any attempt at friendship on my end will be a desperate act.I could be entirely wrong. I would have liked if we'd hugged at the end or made additional plans. She agreed to doing something in the near future but I didn't get any excitement out of it. Optimistically I want to say we could probably be friends. Cynically I think she's not going to reach out and I spent an hour each way driving took a day off of work for what I wanted to be a great date - I did all of that for nothing.Of the 3 actual dates I've gone on after many years of rejection and indifference - the first didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested and ghosted me for weeks the second said sweet things about me but said she wasn't ready and was still healing from a previous relationship and said I need to be with someone who can do 50-50 in the relationship and now this where I felt someone coming onto me and tried to match it and realizing at the end that I walked away in a toxic cloud of mental fog.I hate dating.

I've been planning my wedding that is happening in May of this year.I got engaged a few months ago in January and at first I felt fine with taking on everything but now it's starting to get into my head and I feel overwhelmed everyday.My days consist of me working wedding planning and sleeping. Most of the time if i'm doing something other than that I'm thinking of my wedding anyways. If I go shopping there's always something that will catch my eye and remind me of what I need to do or purchase for the big day.Not only that but my partner is in another country (LDR) and he can only do so much to help me with it all besides pay for things here and there. I live on my own while my partner lives at home (he's never been on his own before) and i'm struggling to pay for small things like a DJ or even cake.I've tried talking to him about wedding stuff and he tends to get overwhelmed or be distracted with other things he's doing like gaming etc. Last night I was talking to him about décor options we had and I showed him our ceremony space. It's on a terrace/large outdoor patio at this nice hotel in my city. I went personally to view the venue a week after we got engaged sent him videos and photos and he loved it too! Now when i showed him the photos last night he made a few ""not so happy"" faces and I almost started crying right there from the stress of it all. He kept saying ""I guess it'll have to do.."" and things like that. Felt like I screwed it up so bad.I feel like a failure that I picked a bad venue...and to top it all off I have a few people in my bridal party who are being really catty towards me now. They keep shitting on me for having ""bad communication"" even though I'm trying my best and have everything on MY shoulders. They haven't offered to do anything specific but constantly say ""I want to help in any way I can! Let me know what to do!"" and I have no clue what to ask them. Also a bridesmaid of mine really dislikes my MOH and tries to make me feel like she's not doing ""enough"" and says she feels she's unsupportive.I didn't even want a big wedding at a hotel. I originally imagined a wedding where I am married at a nice park have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a pub for a beer after to celebrate.The only reason it became a big wedding is because of my in laws and my family coming plus a bunch of my friends wanted to go.

HiI’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home I found the job to be manageable albeit stressful for the first 8-9 months.However after a year I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout feeling completely drained unmotivated and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less the results are still expected.I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand the benefits of international experience such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives are invaluable. On the other hand the stress is taking its toll and I'm not sure if it's worth it.I would appreciate any advice from those who have been in similar situations or know someone who has.

48348,"I can't stop thinking and I need to vent!! Hi Reddit I'm here to vent about my stress and honestly I have no one to talk to. I am F (23) and last year I started my first ""big girl job"" as a copywriter in marketing. I originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer anything to get me to be on set. My love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. I enjoy talking to the cast getting behind the camera and being transported to a different unique world. So why was my first big job in marketing? During the pandemic my concern was how to get myself out there when I was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing and I took it (honestly anything to make my portfolio and resume look good). Not going to lie; the internship was fun and exciting so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now having been here for a year I've built up an extreme amount of stress.Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed anxious and depressed. I'm always messing up and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. I am struggling with my grammar not being strong enough when it comes to presenting and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result I received a PIP and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat don't feel like getting out of bed can't breathe can't sleep and can't think clearly.Additionally I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months (yes you read that right). My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.The whole experience is making me feel like a failure like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school debt help my parents pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet and help my grandma in Mexico and more bills?My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. They say I should still be proud because I tried something new created a new set of skills and toughened up. I don't know if that's true.",Stress

Three weeks ago I started up a new job with security I got one 6 hour shift and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly I love this job despite the hours and I can handle it. But this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then two days later my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old toxic unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. Oh I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up in pain slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell.

One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors. Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor. It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme. We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them. It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL. We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort body relaxation self talk etc. These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally. In fact the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.

48407,"Dealing with the Critics in Your Life Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world write a novel devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. ### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:**Clarify your purpose.** As humans we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations their skill set their propensity for risk their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? **Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire movie star teacher doctor or sit on the couch all day there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. **Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines you are on the pitch and playing the game.**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful move on. You have more important things to do.**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat you must be doing something correct!**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit.

Because I am nothing I am not worth anything low self esteem never had any aspirations goals only liked cars wasn’t very social couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change.

I’ll try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as I feel like I can no longer continue living with this feeling.A general idea about myself is that I am a 22 yrs old medical student. I usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations regardless of the fact that I score the highest amongst my batch. My story starts the summer of 2021 where I met a girl that goes to the same medical school as I do. Half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and I didn’t think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs. At this time my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didn’t affect me as I knew it was because of her being angry (she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didn’t mean it). This started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time I’ve had hurtful things being said to me. This progressively increased till the summer of 2022 (~11 months past for our relationship) which was the same summer in which I would take my Step 1 exam (a really important exhausting and dreadful exam). At this point I used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible I used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety I also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming. We had a fight around 3 weeks before my exam which was my last straw and I communicated to my partner at that time that I want to end things as I felt I should communicate to her my true feelings that I no longer feel like I can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together (the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights). She was devastated cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself. I was heistant but decided to give her a chance it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned. I tried to battle it and not disclose it to her but eventually I couldn’t hide it anymore and told her I couldn’t accept and give her another chance (around ~4 days before my exam). The whole 4 days and holiday after the exam was devastating I was really sad and down. With time I used to distract myself and go out with friends (I don’t drink) almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation. Keep in mind that I’ve got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how I was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers. Similarly over the last couple of months (it’s been 6 months since our breakup) I’ve been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how sad/devastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as I was the reason for her current feelings. Similarly it made me self-conscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims I never loved her and if I did I would never leave her.Fast forward to the last month (5 months since breakup) where I finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and I couldn’t lay my eyes off her. In the first 3 days (through text) I was very happy and excited to get to know her. Three days later (which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament) I started to have this same tiring coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something I am worrying about. It started to increase progressively and I’ve always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head but it has been really taking a toll on me as I almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day. Keeping in mind that throughout this period we’ve grown really close and she seems to really care about me. I have this feeling in the background around 60% of the day 20% is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder 20% consist of me actually overthinking and worrying. I really don’t understand why is this happening: a. Am I feeling guilty that I am meeting a new person? b. Am I worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one? c. Am I scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship? d. Why is the same feeling (but less intensity) that I was having before I left my ex happening again???? e. Is the person not compatible for me and I am still seeking my ex? f. Did I still not move on from my previous relationship (prior to the new girl I was certain that I did move on and had 0 feelings but I brought it up now because I have no idea what is the reason for this feeling)Any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me. This is a previous post of what I felt with my ex that I posted 200d ago:https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/w5ypbm/morning_anxiety_life_and_relationships/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",Stress

He’s kind willing to help and available for me. If you ask me I wouldn’t even say that I feel stressed before the meetings in the sense that I’m not overthinking I’m not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. Yet I don’t know why systematically 10-5 minutes before the meeting I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have even if I had a light breakfast before. I really don’t know what can I do to stop this because it doesn’t feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far I systematically throw up.

This past year is the first time I've had a very unhealthy relationship with food (had my second child and have been nursing her. I'm a sahm with a 3 and 1 year old). All I can think about is food and eating. I'm constantly ""snacking"" and I'm always eating really bad and unhealthy options. I sometimes get healthier options but something in my brain just won't go for those in the moment and I truly feel I can't control it(I know I can and should be able to but I guess my willpower sucks). I'm so sick of starting and restarting my health journey every day because I can't keep from overeating to an insane level. It's truly becoming embarrassing and I have so much shame.I also have issues with hair pulling. I'll sit and pull my hair out one strand at a time anytime I'm idle. I'm well into it before I even realize how long I've done it. I've had this issue on and off since college. I've spoken about both of these issues with my therapist this past week and all she really told me was to find a sort of ""fidget"" to use when I'm idle to keep from the hair pulling. She gave me no advice on my food issues so I hoping to continue pushing that at the next session.

In my work as a hypnotherapist most of my clients are mature adults experiencing issues rooted in anger anxiety depression - or a mixture of these. Often they are wondering if their present issues are linked to their childhood experiences. More often than not the answer is yes. Research carried out since the end of the last century has led to a greater understanding of how adverse childhood experiences impact on long term wellbeing – both physical and psychological. The key findings are:· Childhood trauma is very common: even in so-called well-to-do areas.· There is a direct link between childhood trauma and chronic disease in adulthood.· The more types of trauma a child experiences the greater the risk of them of experiencing social and emotional problems as adults.· Those who experience childhood trauma often experience more than one type of trauma.",Stress

48464,"[Question] Burned out but boss loves my ability and will continue to incentivize if I do more TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.I was given a rather good yearly review and well incentivized but I am currently stressed and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue but also have me lead more be more of a driver and influencer and upgrade my knowledge cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly and knows how fast I can operate.Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels needed downtime and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing - What if anything do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good. ( absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression.)- What would you do if you were me with these concerns and yet burned out?",Stress

It was fine at the moment because I was away at college and I had a house near my school. Now that I’m about to graduate and hopefully move back home to save money I have brought up this issue if I could get the room back but instead of hearing me out they had stated that I can just go to the library study.

Many people store emotional energy in the body- specifically in the fascia since 80% of nerve pathways end in the fascia- and yin targets release of fascia and connective tissue through long (3+ min) passive holds.

Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues.

I also saw my best friend pass away in a freak fire accident 3 years ago. All my friends are married / getting married and I feel constantly alone and sad. I can’t cope I run my own company and I’m independent enough to live my life currently - but there’s no security for the future and I’m just constantly feeling like I’m racing with time to make ends meet. I feel like no one understands the place I am in physically and mentally and my physical health is making me unable to work mentally - and if I don’t work I won’t be able to sustain myself. I used to be a go getter- constantly at the gym and now I struggle to get out of bed. I have no answers on what’s happening to me .The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease. Someone please help",Stress

I live down south in a mountainous/hilly area and i find it stressing even as a passenger at times because of how winding and narrow the roads are. it's as if a normal street was cut in half. there is consistently a large amount of brush around these roads which can obscure my vision. there are also a lot of guard rails around these roads which adds to it. i am being pressured by my family to learn to drive mainly because 10 years ago my mom got high on prescription pills as she often does and went out at 3 in the morning driving somewhere and critically injured herself almost paralyzing herself in the process (i was told that my mother is in the .1% of people who have a full complete recovery from the type of spinal damage she incurred in her accident without any loss of mobility). i also take prescription medication and she has begun threatening to not pick up my prescriptions anymore if i don't do this which has also added to my stress. my family tells me that i can do all sorts of fun activities outside if i have a car (which i have little to no interest in the only reason i leave my house is for food shopping and doctor's appointments). i obviously do not live somewhere there is easily accessible public transportation either. for the most part i'm scared of injuring myself or another person if i'm behind the wheel.,Stress

48528,"To those who give car rides UPDATE IN COMMENTS: I’m a college student from out of state. I left home because I didn’t like the environment I was in and being out of state was one of the best options. I don’t have a car and it’s mostly a public transportation type place so it’s not the biggest issue. I don’t ask people for rides unless I really need them. If we go out I’ll tell them we can take the bus. On rare occasions if I need it I’ll ask for a ride. I was getting close to someone and only then did I ask them to take me to target twice once we went the other we didn’t and the second time I really needed to go for a project. So you kinda get the jist of it. When I need to go to and from the airport I has rely on others this is one are I need help in because Ubers are so expensive (also I only need it after and before the winter summer and one thanksgiving break). I generally don’t care too much about it’s safety because I feel it’s generally safe but this one time it’s kind of an issue. I also would like to mention that I don’t really have friends in school. Anyways I ended up contacting many MANY people. They all basically said no. The flight would come in at around 12 AM and none of them could pick me up. I honestly got angry. My thought process was that I’m literally in a bad situation I need a ride and no one can either wake up or cut their plans short? It honestly just made me so frustrated. I get im not your best friend but a girl taking an Uber at 12AM-1AM isn’t okay for many. I’m not the type to go out a lot so it’s uncomfortable for me. I get it’s late at night but it just made me feel like people are selfish. I hope I never treat others the way I feel when I ask others for a ride. Because it feels terrible and I’m not saying these people are the exact reason why I feel this way. I’m sure it’s an accumulation but it just feels so terrible. I hate having to beg and pry and ask. I hate asking for a ride so I do try my best to get there myself. I even offer to pay because I don’t want people to do it for free and then me feel like I’m always bothering them.I don’t know what to do I know I’m emotional about this but people who have cars and give others a ride should try and be more empathetic to those who don’t.",Stress

I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is pour some in the grinder to make sure.Was it expensive? Well getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes mochas I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process satisfaction in these product and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy but friends and family can as well.My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring there's plenty of resources. If you like writing maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit.

They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine.

48593,"Stressed or what? 39M (Sweden) 177 cm 90 kgHey! Ok I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day. I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer. I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back. It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow. Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor. Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again I became very nervous stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away he says he can't find it. I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma. He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where. He you catch me again and the lump is still there. Instead he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed. I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me. I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show. Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind. I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there. The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So I still have it and I'm alive.During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems. I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn acid regurgitation irregular stools stomach pain stomach cramps etc.).I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress nervousness panic disorder death anxiety over an extended period of time?Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.Please write a line or two what you think.Sorry for a long post but it's important and nice for me to write a little.Thanks!",Stress

Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.**Communicate.** With your plan in place communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations that you’re on your way to calmer times that you’re learning a lot about yourself perhaps that others are supporting you.**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk hit the weights an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward. **Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",Stress

48632,"Is this all life is supposed to be? I know life is supposed to be difficult. I know stressful things can happen and that most of us learn how to cope in a healthy way. Eating right and exercising are supposed to make us healthy and happy both physically and mentally. We're supposed to have hobbies (beginner at knitting) to keep us occupied and to do our duties which manifests in the job that I do almost every day. We need to have a network of support from friends and family. Life isn't just what happens to you it's how you react to it. That's what I tell myself.Yet it seems that life or at least my life is just one stressful event after another. Be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stresses you out for the next few transferring from one branch to another in your job looming deadlines and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hours a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. Many times I'm happy and I catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. WITHOUT FAIL it does. I deal with it successfully and it's on to the next one! Over and over and over again catching moments of pleasure and peace in between. It's not a very good comparison but it's kind of like Dark Souls where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.I'm slowly being chipped away at. I've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living but it seems at this point that it's just a tower I've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the elements that I'm constantly repairing.I've been tired. So tired. It's like I died a long time ago and I'm only 23. I know everybody deals with constant stressors so is everyone secretly feeling this way? Is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? Religion? Are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? This can't be all that life is!My grandfather eats junk food. He stands or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he goes for a walk before coming home and eating. He's been through the Vietnam war and lost almost everything. Despite sleep apnea cancer a fat-rich diet and falling once he's still thriving in his eighties. No one gets to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.There's something obvious I'm missing something that appears to make all the difference. I don't think a girlfriend will fix this nor will any big purchases or materialism. Ideally I'd have a life of inner peace and contentment filled with steady but peaceful determination. Otherwise life has no meaning to it.",Stress

Earlier today I had an eye appointment after what feels like a year and throughout the time I would supposedly have my watch recording so I could listen back to it later on. Unfortunately just after I was done I found that the thing DIDN’T record anything at all even though I was sure I pressed the record button on it! Now I’ve spent the majority of the day stressed out at the fact that I had to rely on my memory to try to replay what my eye doctor’s informed me of when my mind’s already on too many things to begin with! I mean I know it’s supposed to be mundane and something to forget about as the days go one not to mention how much my own mother kept in telling me to let such things go and not focus too much on it….

To speak I live in South East Asia where work is long hours and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.I have been managing my stress with family issues too so everything is a bit of a mishmash as I am angrily typing this down. And autism doesn't help with my stress management either.I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it.

48657,"How can I change my current ( most of my life) situation? I wonder if I’m the only one sometimes going through all this . Anyway I’m a 35 year old male living in Los Angeles working soon will have my own apartment in a few months because of my autism ( though most people don’t know I’m autistic). I have a roommate currently. I am originally from the sf Bay Area and while I loved it there I needed a change . Weather for one thing and LA just seemed so exciting and it is . Anyway I moved here in 2018 and love it . So I’m happy in the city I live in but I’m not happy with the circumstances of the last two years and instead of looking back I’m trying to look forward and realize my lie isn’t over and boring and useless. First off I used to go the gym and run and eat healthy and I was in much better shape obviously. Than Covid came my work hours changed and so did my diet along with everything else. I work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what I’m talking about. So in 2022 I tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian forcing myself to go back to the gym etc but my motivation is just not there yet . I do have a small social life so I’m thankful for that and I am also a photographer as I love all the architecture in this city . But I need more friends my age I’mGuessing and there just seem to be no women who aren’t partiers or who would let me be myself with them . Or maybe I’m looked at as asexual or unattractive. Anyways I just need something more exciting than just work and home . I wish I had a group o could do things with but of course my schedule makes it tough .My dating/sex history:I was never very good at asking women out even though most of my life I was told I was extremely handsome I’m tall 6”1 blonde hair brown eyes . I was told I could have modeled when I was younger . Anyway I didn’t lose my virginity till I was 20 which is late but partly because i was shy just not confident. I had an opportunity to be that girls boyfriend who I lost my virginity to but I just decided I didn’t want a relationship with her well between 2007 and 2009 I had no heterosexual sex but desired it but was insecure etc . I’ll admit because I grew up in San Francisco and had gay friends I even experimented with gay men as a way out since I was just not having relationships with women but I realized obviously I was not gay or bi since I didn’t feel attracted to men . Than I’m 2010 I had sex with a drunk cougar and that was one and done . I had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it was horrible. I than tried going to “ cougar bars” with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone and it wasn’t my scene anyway. Than in 2012 I met my first girlfriend who was older than me at a class. Funny thing is I liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . We saw the Batman dark knight movie which was our first date in 2012. Well we fucked like crazy so much so that I felt it was a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh….Well I eventually drove her away and regretted it . And since then I’ve slept with a few older women from 2015-2019. But since Covid I’ve had no sex except masturbation . Partly I still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like Women will never be into me which I know is nonsense of course . But I am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand I would like to be in a relationship on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in LA with my camera . I almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because I feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that I’m just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe I’m better off just with a few friends and my own life . Partly I think I need someone who I can be myself around them without judgment and I’m trying to change . Maybe I’m just to weird or absent minded . I try to work on my confidence and I try toFake it till I make it but that can only last so long . I do have confidence issues and while I’m secretive about it deep inside I feel like most women are either judging me or think I’m unattractive or that I’m gay. I guess I need to work on myself . I want to get back into shape eat healthier exercise like I used to . Also I use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when Covid came I got lazy. I’m going to try and get myself together and work on myself. I take my medication for depression which helps and I do have a therapist but I can’t see her as much as I’d like . I do have challenges but I always try to work through them My issues with sex relationships asking women out :I have often had issues with asking women out etc. it’s weird maybe I am incel yet I don’t blame my problems on women I blame it all on myself that I’m my own worst enemy. I tend to shoot myself in the foot . It’s weird because I don’t consider myself repressed. I grew up in a liberal household in San Francisco. I also am not a right winger as most incels are . I am liberal . Anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . I on the other hand have trouble because I don’t want to make a fool of myself come off as creepy etc . Good example is there is this customer at work who I like and comes in most everyday . Her and I talk quite a bit when I’m helping her and we smile at each other . And I think she likes me but probably just being friendly. Two of my colleagues know I like her and always ask “ Have you asked her out yet “ I always give an excuse or that she wouldn’t want to have anything to do with me that way. So other guys could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. Also I’m not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. The funny thing is I can talk to beautiful women because I do every day because I work in Beverly Hills and I can engage and be friendly but on my own I don’t seek out to talk to women because of my own fear as how they view me. The funny thing is I did ask my ex gf out but it wasn’t really a “date asking her out it was more casual and things developed. I just wonder if I can overcome these issues that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . I just sometimes feel I’m cursed .h",Stress

I’m 21 now and never had a cleaning job like this. So i turn up for my 1st day and was greeted by a woman and a confused looking bloke. She said “firstly have we got safety shoes and a hi vis?” I looked at her confused. “No?” Long story short i was never told to bring either of the things because like i said i was told it was an office cleaning job so she gave me a hi vis and some borrowed shoes that were massive on me which i had to wear for 3 days because again wasnt told i needed safety shoes an i was broke af. She took me into a huge warehouse with different compartments and said this is what ill be cleaning. Along with rooms connected to the warehouse that operate massive machinery making car parts. She told this confused bloke that had only been there for a week to show me around this guy had no clue what he was doing tbh just pointed at things and told me i had to “empty bins that way”. Later i was then told i had to drive around this fucking monster of a cleaning machine in tight rooms never had proper training on this thing btw just got told what buttons to press and to just practice. Yeah sure I’ll just practice not crashing a giant machine into stacks of metal cages whilst also dodging death. I have crashed this machine not badly luckily but have definitely been in situations that couldve killed me. The thing that really pissed me off is the fact i was struggling on driving this thing today the supervisor who was meant to be helping me didnt want to help me (laughed and shyed away) when i was panicking on the machine cos i couldnt get it through this gap and i didnt want to crash into big metal boxes that couldve fell on me. She got on it and started getting nervous herself being on it and hated driving it just as much as i do then started mocking how i have to drive it and she doesnt. Keep in mind shes meant to have fucking trained me to use it.From tomorrow onwards im going to use a push machine to clean the floors and if they dont like it im leaving because that job is a jobs worth and they dont give a fuck about my safety.",Stress

48665,can you be deeply in love with 2 people at the same time? So there's this guy. An ex ss officer. He fell in love with a jewish prisoner in Auschwitz and had a relationship with her. After the war he tried to contact her to be with him but she wanted nothing more to do with him so he started a new life family got married . He had this one picture ofher(in her auschwitz prisoner uniform) and he used to cut out her head and put her on another clothing away from Auschwitz. He used to do this for the most of his life (the filmaker says it was a way for him to imagine an alternative life they could have had).He copied the picture and kept it in his wallet until the day he died. So when his daughter was 16 she said her father told her about this Jewish girl and that he never ever in his life felt true love like that. He even gave his daughter a locket with a picture of him and his ex Jewish girlfriend not her mother. His daughter said it was odd and she also said that this Jewish girl was the love of his life(in a documentary there was a documentary made about them). So the filmmaker which is close to both his and Jewish girls families said that the ss officer was deeply and truly in love in this Jewish girl till the day he died. His wife also knew about his ex.So in 1972 he had to go to the court because of his war crimes against humanity and his ex Jewish girlfriend was a witnesswhen he saw her after 30 years of no contact he started to cry. Does that mean even while married to his wife he loved his ex girlfriend more? Does that mean that he would maybe leave his wife for her?,Stress

Meaning I've had a lot of stress my entire life. Recently I've started to take notice of how old I and others look. I'm obsessed with guessing how old people are whenever I find someone who I think is my age or looks as old as I do I find they're at least 5 years if not 10 years older than me. I'm only 21 and I feel like I already look older than my 6 year older brother. My cheeks are hollow and my hair is thin. My skin looks rough and my skin complexion is uneven. It's rough. I don't know how to accept this. It feels so unfair and I'm struggling to deal with it. I obviously don't KNOW if I'm any older than I am and am looking into having my biological age tested but all the physical and cognitive markers or age are showing. Has anyone else dealt with this?

My wife and I work opposite schedules so that we don't have to rely on day care or a babysitter. We have a 16 month old daughter 2 cats and a dog. I try my best to keep the house tidy but little detail stuff like dusting vacuuming and mopping seem almost impossible to do and after a day it looks like nothing even got done. Outside chores is a race while she naps during the day and what ever doesn't get done has to wait for a second nap or another day. By no means is my house filthy but there are a lot of projects I can't seem to start and trying to just maintain it is a project in itself. Before the kid I was able to do a lot more but between her and trying to get basic stuff done while working is very draining. Normally I'd wait till the evening to do something after she goes to bed but lately I just wanna play on my phone or watch a movie. I love my family with all my heart and would not change a thing I'm just stressed because I think of everything that needs to get done and it causes me to procrastinate even more.

Back in August I found a job that I actually enjoy doing but my coworkers are stressing me out so horribly that I have allergic reaction like hives on the right side of my face and neck. I work at a gym in the daycare center and as of late we’ve been getting an influx of gym members which in turn means more children. At my gym we have two different rooms for childcare. We have a childcare room for toddlers (where I work) and then we have “kids club” for elementary school age kids. There is more than the age difference between the two rooms. Kids club is a much larger room and has more mature toys such as monster high dolls Jenga and a giant connect four. This room is better equipped for a larger group of kids. The other room is basically a glorified supply closet which is perfect for small children. Now we got that out of the way I can get to why I’m here: Between these two room there is supposed to be two people working one in child care and one in kid’s club but as of late I’ve been the only person scheduled for any form of daycare. It’s been extremely difficult to manage the toddlers and making sure the older kids are okay.

(Statista)😓* 74% of people feel so stressed they have been overwhelmed or unable to cope. (Mental Health Foundation and YouGov)😦* 13.7 million working days are lost each year in the UK because of work-related stress anxiety and depression costing £28.3 billion yearly. (NICE) 🤯Tips to Deal with  Stress: \-**Explore your triggers**: Keep a diary for one week to discover which situations increase your stress levels the most. \-**Practice time management**: Trying to do everything at once isn't an effective way to handle stress as it usually takes you longer to complete your tasks. Ensure that you are organised by managing your time efficiently. **-Set boundaries:** It's easy to be available 24 hours a day due to current technology. Establish some boundaries so work is distanced from your personal life. **-Life outside of work:** To avoid experiencing burnout you must take some time to look after yourself and engage in activities you enjoy. **-Build a support network:** Speaking with and meeting up with friends and family can help you feel more positive and reduce your vulnerability to stress. **-Focus on healthy habits:** Avoid alcohol caffeine and nicotine get enough sleep eat well and be active.**-Do a course:** There are plenty of courses available that will teach you to understand the symptoms and causes of stress steps you can take to deal with your stress and will help you practice dealing with stressful situations in the safety of exercises. For example **VirtualSpeech** is offering a free trial for their Managing Workplace Stress course and **FutureLearn** also offers a Workplace Wellbeing course.",Stress

I have two blood/circulatory autoimmune disorders that are not that difficult to regulate but can get annoying sometimes because I often have to go to more appointments than I’d like. Also depending on the job I may have to ask for accommodations. The last manager that I asked for an accommodation basically insinuated that I was lying and even when I proved it with a doctors note she was still very rude about it and acted like I was asking for something ridiculous other than needing to get up every two hours and walk around for five minutes because of my poor circulation. I have been let go in the past due to taking time off for medical conditions but of course they don’t say that it’s because of medical condition they just say I’m taking “too much time off.” So I can’t claim ADA discrimination. I’ve been at my new job for a little over a year now and they are so flexible and have no issues with me taking time off but of course I built up this wall because of previous jobs and I’m always terrified to ask for time off when I need to go to a doctors appointment. My doctor is like “your health is more important than your job and you need to make this work so that you can do everything you need to do to handle your autoimmune diseases.” Obviously my health is more important than a job but he doesn’t think about the fact that companies don’t give a shit about health and if I lose my job due to taking time off I won’t be able to afford insurance or pay out-of-pocket for him.

48689,"The Psychology of Horror Movies: Why People Enjoy Being Scared Shocked and Disgusted While fear shock and disgust are typically seen as negative emotions that we want to avoid they can also be an enjoyable experience in certain situations.Horror movies are one of the best examples of this. When you’re watching a horror movie about ghosts zombies serial killers aliens or monsters your nervous system naturally kicks into gear as if you’re experiencing a real threat from your environment.**This** [**fight flight or freeze**](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-complete-guide-to-daily-stress/)**-response creates a biochemical rush of adrenaline endorphins and dopamine which can create a type of “natural high.”**However while your body experiences the “natural high” of a real threat your brain knows deep down that you’re actually safe and secure – and there’s no real danger present.One early [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00995932) published in the journal *Motivation and Emotion* looked into why people enjoy eating really spicy foods (such as chili peppers) and found a similar response.Chili enjoyers still feel the same irritation and pain of eating spicy foods as everyone else but they enjoy the rush of adrenaline and endorphins it produces. It stimulates the body’s “warning system” in a harmless and risk-free way that can be exciting and exhilarating.This type of [positive thrill-seeking](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/positive-thrill-seeking/) can be found in many other relatively safe and harmless activities such as riding rollercoasters extreme sports skydiving an intense workout or playing competitive video games.**New psychology research shows that the experience of negative emotions (in a safe and controlled context) can be very enjoyable and beneficial.**One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30307264/) published in the scientific journal *Emotion* found that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) – such as purposely making ourselves scared – can lead to an overall boost in mood like when we watch a horror movie or visit a haunted house.The study looked at individuals who bought tickets for an “extreme haunted house” event which was designed to elicit a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety fear shock and disgust.After the “haunted house” experience most individuals reported an overall boost in euphoria and positive mood especially if they felt tired bored or stressed beforehand.While the sample is biased (people who buy tickets to haunted houses are more likely to enjoy them) the study does reveal that some people genuinely enjoy scaring themselves.Furthermore the study found that individuals who enjoyed the haunted house experience also showed less stress while completing subsequent cognitive and emotional tests (including showing less reactivity in the brain during those tests as measured by EEG recordings).Researchers theorize that “voluntarily arousing negative emotions” (VANE) can teach us how to better deal with future stress and anxiety.This is a common technique behind a lot of *exposure therapy* where a person is gradually put into a fearful situation so they become more “desensitized” to some irrational fear or phobia. For example a person scared of flying may be asked by a therapist to visualize themselves getting on a plane until they learn to manage their fear better.By actively exposing ourselves to fear shock or disgust in a safe and controlled way we get to practice regulating these emotions in the moment which is an important pillar of [emotional intelligence](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/4-fundamental-pillars-of-emotional-intelligence/).**Horror movies** ***simulate*** **extraordinary experiences that we normally wouldn’t have in the real world. When we watch a horror movie we put ourselves in the protagonist’s position and ask ourselves** ***“What would I do in this situation?”***New research shows fans of horror movies may even be more prepared to face real-world catastrophes.One fascinating [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492010/) published in *Personality and Individual Differences* discovered that fans of “horror movies” and “pandemic movies” were more resilient during the COVID pandemic. It was also found that fans of “prepper” genres in particular (alien-invasion apocalyptic and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness.This is one reason why “pandemic” movies such as *Contagion* and *28 Days Later* showed a huge spike in popularity during COVID.Ultimately horror movies give us a chance to face our fears and practice [mentally rehearsing](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/mental-rehearsal-changing-habits-through-the-power-of-visualization/) how we would respond in extremely intense situations.

48692,"So much happened this week and i can't handle myself. I am 28 years old and my birthday is tomorrow. I am not the one who cares much about my age or celebrates it. However i am having a very bad week and seem too stressed out. To start with i was on a weekend trip with my girl friends to relax and meet after 2 long years. It was fun. But i am always the 3rd wheel in that friendship. They both are nice to me and they wish well for me. But i am the complete opposite of them. They are funny crack jokes extrovert and i am none of it. I just listen to them and enjoys the company sort of. They are good looking and can carry themselves. I am bit on the fatty side and does not look much good in the pictures. I think it always bothers me. Anyways i come back from the trip and thought to stay with my boyfriend for some days. I feel lonely even when he is around. He gets very excited about his work and talks continuously about it. I am very much discouraged and demotivated by it even though i should not. He helped with a lot of stuff at work. I keep wondering why i am not excited as much as he is. I am interested in doing my work but i am not an expert. Just an average person at work. But i am a team lead too and the management part of comes easily for me. I normally handles the new joinee mentorship any documentations managing the team calls setting up sessions. Somewhat what a culture team would do. I like doing this but i don't want to be known for it. Anyways past week my department head called me up and said he sending some names selected for attending a training and asked to review it. I thought I might be in it but i was not. Every lead except me which made me very sad. I do not know why i was not even considered. I am not that bad. Yet again. This all happened when i was still at my boyfriend's place. I don't think he knows i was struggling with all this negative vibes happening. Still i thought i will hold my head high. I started going through my drive which the girls uploaded the pics of us. I don't normally go through it. I thought i might as well because my sister was asking for pics. So i selected some which i looked better with them. I thought i will send some good ones and some bad ones for the fun of it. The moment i send it she replied telling me i look terrible in it. That I have put on too much weight and no one would tell this to my face. By that point i was breaking down. I was crying hard and was feeling so much heavy in my heart. I was with my boyfriend and yet he does not know my heart was breaking with all the pain. I don't if i should blame him or I should have gone to him. May be he does not know i am struggling and i am not willing to tell him my struggles. So i texted my sister back "" yup i know"". I don't think she know i was upset. Then my second sister texted me saying i should take care of my health. Our family has diabetes genes. She was telling me the same thing. I was okay with her msging but i am very upset with the other sister for bitching about my weight. I only send pics to her. This all happened on Friday. At work i did literally nothing. I could not do anything. I keep thinking about hypothetical scenarios and to wishful thinking if i could just leave everything behind. It was so much pain. Tomorrow is my birthday and i want to be alone..just alone. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this birthday is the thing that's making me miserable. But honestly i am not worried about getting aged. I am just tired. I know I should not expect people to come to you. But oh man I wish i could have someone who can feel me and i can open up to. I know i have people to talk. People will listen to me. But i can't open up to them. Everything is bottled up inside and i am so so stressed and sad and what not. I just wanted to write my miseries.

48696,No one to talk to So I’m currently super stressed and I don’t feel like I have anyone to talk to. I’ve suffered with depression for a long time and I recently got a puppy. I’ve wanted another dog for about 10 years and I thought it was a good time to get one now since I’m WFH. The puppy is about 3 months old and at around 2 months she started throwing up. I took her to the emergency vet and found out she had an obstruction in her intestines. This meant she had to have surgery and her insurance hasn’t kicked in so I had to pay out of pocket. I had to take out a credit card to pay the 7K bill. She came home and was doing really well. Then 2 days ago she started throwing up again. She threw up around 6 times. I took her back to the vet and they had to run a bunch of tests again (another 1K) and it seems like a treat I gave her may have irritated her intestines again. They wanted to do more tests but I literally can not afford it. I spoke to the vet about it as none of this can be covered by insurance. The vet gave her an anti nausea medication and sent us home to observe her. She ate and hasn’t vomited but I’m still nervous about it all. I really got the dog in hopes that it would also help with my depression but it’s becoming worse due to all of this…I feel helpless and I can’t afford to take her back to the vet…,Stress

I went to go drop it today however on the way out I got into a fender bender which will be my second accident this year and i'm still on my parents insurance. I'm such a colossal fuckup and I don't know what I can do to repair this situation. I'm going to go get a job soon so the finical strain wont be too hard but I just cant believe how much ive ruined my parents trust they placed in me. The worst part is its all my fault I just cant believe how easy it is to ruin trust and respect and how hard it is to earn it back. I feel paralyzed I cant calm down and this is ontop of the fact that I have anxiety over searching for a job. I threw up due to how stressed I was. I feel like I cant talk to anyone but strangers about how bad i feel right now. I just have no idea how to be ok.,Stress
48698,"Restricting stressors on devices. help! Hi all I thought this would be a good place to ask.Sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress. I have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past even if they would hurt me and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.Right now I've been using an app called 'Freedom' which has been very useful. The issue? I've figured out how to disable it whenever I want. Knowing that at any point I could breach the restrictions I put in place just makes me super anxious. I'm able to go into the VPN settings and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.Does anyone know any surefire way I can block things and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social media for 24 hours is often the best way I can get back on track with my day and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me. Is self discipline my only option or is there a better way?",Stress
48699,"My mind &amp; body choses flight instead of fight. I (26F) am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit but I asked myself aloud ""How do I feel?"" and my answer was: stressed.So here I am. Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that) I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.What I mean by that is closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).Just tonight my mom basically dumped a 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like ""adults"". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I in fact tell this to her everyday so it's not old news. Yet when I did remind her of this she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.Truth is I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me basically looking at me with an expression of ""Ohhh really like what"".So she asks ""Okay what have y'all worked on today?"" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said ""Well we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said 'That was it?' Not gonna lie it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says 'I know you can do it. I know that.'But does she really? Anytime I do 'do it' she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. I get upset and after we finish talking I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole 'why is my life like this'.It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.I don't know I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway disappear or worse). I really do want to work I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things but why am I always on flight mode all the time?",Stress

When I do send out ‘wrong’ emails (aka it double sent or some wires were crossed) I freak out and get way too much adrenaline - I feel like I’ll puke and I get very warm. I know I won’t lose my job over this but I can’t help but overthink. It’s literally to the point that I’m wondering whether this is the right field for me even though I really do like my job. Are there some techniques I can undertake to manage this? Or will it just take time?",Stress

This means I am in charge of the vaccine storage supplies storage supply packing supply chain receiving vaccine shipments keeping inventory and such. I am the only person who does this job at our location. I am required to get each team ready and pack supplies and vaccine before the clinic and to return everything once the teams return.

The only reason i managed with physics in high school was because I memorized most of the solutions and most of the problems were similar to the other problems I practiced. Besides my tutor was good at helping me learn. I'm doing an introductory physics course this semester and I feel so absolutely dumb. We're supposed to work in groups to complete activities and every week we are given a set of problems for homework. The professor adds a set of puzzles at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever.The thing is I never really liked physics in the first place but not I hate it. The labs are for two hours I can't understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and I can't. I remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on Discord and I would have been grateful if they had given me a few hints about how they solved that problem but all they did was send the wrong answers and made a bunch of memes about how they trolled me. One of the guys is so arrogant about how he took AP Physics and he knows all of the concepts and is so good at physics.Meanwhile I can't even do a single problem independently. The professor also gives a bunch of puzzles like kenkens or spatial reasoning problems that I'm too dumb to do and I'm doing the worst in that class. It's just too much for me. Aside from that course I'm in computer science and while my other classes aren't as awful they're also pretty difficult. Plus I have work study and most of my work hours coincide with the office hours. I still have to take the course as a requirement and I feel like I'm going to fail. I get panic attacks every night thinking about it and I can't deal with it anymore.",Stress

I would do assignments a couple days before it was due and have zero stressHowever recently I’m getting assignments done WEEKS ahead of time which I’m proud of tbh. I’m taking my education more seriously and It’s like a need to get it done with better quality thus making more time for myself and picking up extra shifts at my retail job. …but now it’s just getting ridiculous. We’re not even in week 3 and I’m stressing about getting an assignment done on time for week 6. I literally cannot fall asleep some nights because I’m thinking too much about it.

48790,Our life is one big ball of stress and I’m overwhelmed! Our lives are in turmoil due to many factors but lately my husband’s concussion and brain injury issues have completely put a stretch on our stress limits. I’m not sure where to go or what to do. He’s very upset over his situation and feels like I don’t understand which of course I do not understand it completely but I have a different set of stressors related to this situation. The problem is that our lives had a lot of stress prior to his injury so it’s just too much. I try not to let on how stressed I am because he obviously is in a worse state that me. He won’t talk about things much and when I try to help him he says I’m making it worse and smothering him. He feels that because I have a background working with people with developmental issues I should just know what to do for him but it is way different when it’s your husband versus a client.

Eventually one of my friends showed up and soon after his friend left (this left me my friend and him at a table that seats 4 people) soon after one of my other friends showed up so all the stats at the table where filled. we where all just working quietly for around an hour. after that hour he later left and my friends left soon after. I spent another hour there by myself finishing up some work I am a big glancer I look around a lot whenever I am doing something so this has caused me and this boy to make a lot of eye contact. when I was taking a break from my work I saw him coming back into the building me and him made eye contact and he quickly walked away this was a bit of a surprise because he usually sits down I assumed that he either wanted the table for himself or he had some friends coming and needed a bigger table. so I moved seats I got up and went to a single table. I went to go fill up my water bottle after I placed my stuff down at the new table when I was walking back to my new table I made eye contact with him again because he was walking the same direction. I sat down at my new table and put my AirPods in assuming that he moved to the table that sat 4 people out of the corner of my eye I saw him walk up to my table. I took my AirPods out and he asked me ""hey you didn't move seats because of me right?"" with ought even thinking I just quickly shook my head and said ""oh no!"" before I could say anything else he said ""ok I was just making sure have a nice day"" and he walked away.

They never worry about anything and wave their hand at any problem they seem to come across. Basically the “who cares if it happens it happens” mindset. It makes me envy those people because I feel like I’m always worried about every scenario and “what if this what if that?” Is it possible to change into that mindset of not caring or worrying about something until or when it happens?

The symptoms are as follows: 24/7 head pressure mainly in the top back of my head insanely dry eyes especially when looking at screens (nothing has helped) feels like my head is spasming and my eyes are shaking. Absolutely nothing resolves this completely ever however I notice when I don’t focus on them and I’m occupied I don’t really necessarily notice the symptoms. If I’m not occupied the symptoms feel much more apparent and worse. I did use Klonapin for a year so maybe the dry eye or some of these shakes are side effects of stopping that a few months ago but the head pressure existed even before I started the Klonapin. Does anyone have the same or similar symptoms?

48828,"Stress when working It's hard to explain I'm guessing its some sort of stress but I can't figure out how to get over it. A little background. Before the beginning of Covid Lockdowns (like right before) I had a major breakdown and went into severe depression. My sister was about to go through a life saving organ transplant (which went well) I had someone break up with me I had 2 major career defining projects I was leading that weren't going well and I was suffering from a torn labrum which stopped me from doing a hobby I loved. All of this happening in the span of about a week.It took me a long time to get out of my depression. I took medication stopped worrying as much about having a great career learned meditation and practiced it daily found a new hobby and tried enjoying life more over the span of the pandemic. I decided to make it a point to get away from my previous job as it caused me a major amount of stress. They overworked me and the pay wasn't great for the amount of responsibilities put on my shoulders.It took me nearly 1.5 years to finally land a new job and leave that job behind. I have fantastic bosses at my new job they pay me well and make sure that I'm compensated for my overtime whenever that is necessary (which isn't often). The only complaint I have about my job is it's a bit boring and not very challenging (or at least it shouldn't be).Now here's my major problem. I'm falling behind on my work and not learning at the speed I use to when starting a new job. I'm having difficulties learning all the systems and parts even though most of my job is just surveying equipment and designing simple parts and cable assemblies.Every time I start on a new task or job I start experiencing a dull stress and what I think is ""brain fog"". It feels like the top of my brain just hardens and I get a mild headache. Over the day it drains me but once I get off work I start quickly recovering.I use to thrive doing challenging work and continually learning new things in my field. Now I just feel tired all the time. I'm tired of feeling like this. I've asked for more challenging tasks from my boss and I get them but it doesn't help.I just want to feel unburdened again at work.",Stress

Here they are-* **Reframe** the stressor to see a whole new picture.During a stressful situation explain the situation on a lighter note to yourself. Remind yourself to see life as continuous learning. Look at the positive side!* Failure is a stepping stone to success.* You failed so what?

Identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed keep track of it in your journal as you keep a daily log you will begin to see patterns and common themes.Write down-* What caused your stress (make a guess if unsure)* How you felt both physically and emotionally* How you acted in response* What you did to make yourself feel better.* **Test your thoughts.**When something stressful happens. Assess what the outcome of the situation like its irrelevance positivity accuracy and the truth behind it. Like what am I think? Is it true? Could there be another way to look at this situation?.* **Manage your time**. Stress is managed by simply planning your day well in advance. Like maintaining a weekly planner with all the deadlines meetings appointments family time and most importantly don’t forget to throw some ‘**me time’** in there too.* You **can’t control everything**.Learn to let go of things over which you don’t have a control.

48832,My life is about to change 5 days from today my life is about to change. While this may or will be a good move for me I am majorly stressed out due to this change. Some background over a year ago the company that I currently work for announced that they will be laying off staff at my location and moving operations back to a HUGE city that I personally didn’t want to move back to so I chose to take my 21 years of service severance package and will be moving further west to the coast. This past year has had issues nonetheless due to the company stalling our end of work date consistently which was due to supply chain issues from the Pandemic which the company didn’t foresee when they announced the layoff and/or work transfer notice. This “stall” has caused a lot of stress on myself and my co-workers with not knowing when we’d all be getting the axe. The company had us all dangling from one meeting to another when finally at the end of last May they announced that our end of work date will be at the end of this August. During this year long “wait” with not knowing when our actual end date would be the lady whom I rented my basement room from took it upon herself and just “guessed” that my end of work date would be sometime last May and basically evicted me out of the basement however she offered me to stay in another room in the house. She did this so she could get more money from a family of three who moved into the basement last May from the UK. This was an annoyance however I do get on very well with the family who are really cool people. I did a massive purge and downsized a lot of my belongings which what is left fits snuggley into my vehicle. I can’t afford to hire a moving truck or get a hitch put on my car and pay for a uhaul trailer…so minimizing was the way to go. With finally knowing my actual end date I could now start prepping for my move further west to the coast. I applied for school got in and start in September. My finances are “f’k’d” to say the least I have had to sink ALOT of money into getting my vehicle road trip ready and due to this has left me very short on cash with funding this road trip/move. I needed to get a “temp” place which allows dogs where the college is and seeing how I don’t know a soul in and around that area I opted to book an air bnb for the moth of September and 1st week of October. This air bnb is pretty pricey. However I felt I have no choice but to go there and start looking for a dog friendly place when I get there. I applied for another credit card but was denied due to a “fraud alert” on my credit report from 4 years ago when I got my vehicle broken into and my purse was stolen. I went and got and paid for the police record supplied my passport and driver’s license as photo I.d and got copies of them all and gave it to the bank where I applied for the credit cards over a week ago. The bank lady sent these copies to the department that issues credit cards but they didn’t read her “notes” and see the attached files. 😑 the Airbnb payment is due this Thursday and I was starting to panic. I asked a family member to help me out to no shagrin. 😑 luckily a very good friend of mine has loaned me the money knowing I will be getting a HUGE severance payout in mid September. thank god. *whew!* still waiting on my own bank to transfer this Airbnb money to my large credit card so I can pay the Airbnb. I am hoping that happens today or tomorrow. I got a finally fix done on my vehicle yesterday and while driving I noticed a strange noise so I will have to go back there to have it looked at.

48842,"I can never relax my neck/shoulders/jaw...any tips? First off I have PTSD from being in the military. I overreact to stressors in my environment significantly. So I am totally aware of having higher stress levels than the average person. But what I do not understand is why my muscles stay tense 24/7.I mainly feel this in my neck/jaw/shoulders area. I literally (and not saying this like ""omg I literally died the other day when...but as in the way the term is actually meant for) feel like I cannot let my head relax into my pillow at night. It's like my body refuses to allow the pillow to take the weight of my head. I can consciously think ""ok I'm gonna relax my neck now and let my head fall deep into this pillow"" and it works...for a few fleeting moments until I stop actively thinking about it. Seconds later I will realize that my shoulders are up to my ears again and my neck is no longer relaxing. I keep my jaw tense all the time as well. So much so that I have so many chipped teeth that my dentist has stopped fixing them until they get really bad. I have a bite guard for sleeping but I think the damage is also done during the day. I asked my wife the other day which was ""normal"" for her: when not thinking about it do your top and bottom teeth stay closed/touching each other or is there a small gap? She went with the small gap and I can see that my body wants that to be my normal too but it is not. My teeth stay chomped down onto each other nearly 24/7. I'd bet my neck and teeth stay tense even when I am asleep. I absolutely hate this. I can never get comfortable. I cannot sleep well. I look like a 10 year old with ADHD because I'm constantly wiggling around while seated in order to get some sort of comfort here and there. And all this misery boils down to the tension in these 3 areas. Anyone have any suggestions for this? I've told my Dr many times at the VA about this and I have muscle relaxers but rarely take them because they make me super sleepy during the day and if I take them at night I feel kinda hung over the next morning. So I only take them when in absolute discomfort. I go to a chiropractor 2x a week. I go to physical therapy for shoulder issues 2x a week. I regularly use a foam roller and a Chirp wheel almost daily several times a day. I even started yoga this week...but I've only been once so far. Oh and I get a massage 2x a month by a massage therapist at the chiropractor who can target areas of concern from my chiropractic file. So not a feel good massage but one that works on working knots out and loosening ligaments (not sure if I am using the right terminology there). Last week after several months she was able to finally ""get in"" my upper traps and for a few amazing godly seconds I actually felt true neck relaxation. It was so wonderful....and so sad when it quickly went back to my normal. But that fleeting glimpse of bliss told me that it is possible to find relief. So I have finally turned to Reddit to ask for help.",Stress

I took the same meds as before which I used for years but my body didn't understand that I have already took then before and had some side effects that scared me and I stopped taking one of the meds.

Went to other doctors and and the 1st side effect went away but the adult medication gave me more and worse side effects so again me psychiatrist suggested changing meds.

48846,"Binaural Beats for stress relieve Hello Guys We’ve haven’t seen anything related to binaural beats here so I thought of sharing something that might be useful to you guys because it helped me a ton. Binaural beats are claimed to induce various same mental states associated like reduce anxiety relieve stress while increasing relaxation increase focus and concentration promote creativity dreaming etc. In essence a binaural beat is an acoustic stereo signal typically a sine wave from which the left channel is slightly detuned to the right channel. This difference measured in Hz produces a waving motion that is actually audible when listened to on stereo headphones. This difference dictates the speed of the binaural beat which has different effects on your brain. Each frequency is associated with outcomes that correspond to different levels of brain wave activity. Here is a little guide on the most important frequency ranges: Anxiety.csv Bipolar.csv Depression.csv Normal.csv README.md Stress.csv Suicidal.csv bep-bile cleaned-output cleaning.sh disorders mental-health-dataset.csv mental-health.csv sorting.sh statements status.csv Gamma waves: Between 30 Hz and 50 Hz linked to higher alertness concentration and improved problem solving learning memory and mood.* Beta waves: between 13 Hz and 30 Hz similar to Gamma linked to an active and alert mind  improves mood and task performance* Alpha waves: between 8 Hz and 13 Hz indicate a relaxed and restful mind can increase creativity* Theta waves: between 4 Hz and 8 Hz associated with drowsiness and meditation reduced anxiety relaxation* Delta waves: between 0.5 Hz and 4 Hz relaxation deep sleep dreamingThere is a lot of stuff on youtube you can check out and listen to. I mostly listen to binaural beats in the beta range for sleeping meditation and lucid dreaming. After 10 minutes you really feel like your are sinking deeper in your mind. These beats are often accompanies by music playing on top of them which is sometimes really nice but we have a created a some natural ambiences that feature binaural beats.  If you want to check out our channel you can do so here.

48847,Does anyone else get stressed out over School even though they’ve been doing it their whole lives? I start my first year of college and I’m super stressed out and even though I’ve been taking College classes through my high school I’m still stressed out about it. I’ve been stressed about school my whole life despite having all As and being in the top 10% of my grade. I really don’t understand how people can just have a calm attitude when it comes to things like school and work because the mere thought of either stresses me out. Now usually after the first month I’m completely fine because I’ve gotten used to the class the teacher and the work but the first couple weeks are so stressful for me. I have a mad fear of being alone and failure and I like things to always stay the same in my life so I guess all of that contributes to my problems with stressful situations. I have no friends going to the same college as me and I’ve always liked having at least one person I knew to make me more comfortable quicker but having work thrown in front of me and having to one to talk to if I need help is terrifying to me.

48854,Relaxing Music. Meditation Music Piano Music Calm Sounds Sleep Music. Often times stress will manifest when we carry over yesterdays concerns into our present day concerns. An accumulation will almost always end up in a high stress level. Therefore we must be able to dump all of our concerns from the previous day or days and concentrate wholly on our today. If you are having trouble sleeping there are a few steps you can take to help your body naturally get to sleep. First try to get to bed at the same time every night your body runs on an internal clock and if you don't get to sleep every night at the same time you can through that clock out of whack so a regular bedtime routine is good practice even if you aren't tired try to lay down maybe read a book or listen to some relaxing music. Lifestyle choices will affect your sleep as well such as smoking illicit drug use and pharmaceuticals alcohol and caffeine; try to limit your intake of such things for better sleep. Next in line is nutrition a combination of herbs and vitamins can help naturally relax the body and mind to help one get better sleep all night long. Green tea is an herb that is loaded with the amino acid l-Theanine studies have shown l-Theanine to can help calm the brain given todays high pass lifestyles most of us are still thinking about work or what needs to go on your grocery list while laying in bed l-Theanine helps calm your thoughts for a better nights sleep.

It got to a point where I would wake up at 9:00 am already thinking about work then work through the whole day and still be replying to my clients' messages at 1:30 am lying in bed with my girlfriend.My mind was constantly there - at work. At the dinner table during a walk with my partner even when skiing on vacation that I rarely took back then...I was constantly experiencing this weird sense of guilt when I wasn't productive and even though my business was growing so was my anxiety stress and lack of satisfaction with life.It eventually led to me getting sick so badly that it was a struggle to even reply to a client's message. I was stressed out of my mind.It felt like everything is going to collapse on me if I keep going down that route.Finally I decided to take a real break. I took a full 7 days off and decided to delete all the apps like Slack Messenger and Gmail from my phone which sounded absolutely crazy to me back then.But man it felt liberating.Something clicked inside me and finally I was able to let go of all the pressure and stress that were haunting me.For the first time in months I experienced this deep sense of relief and inner peace.By stepping out of this craziness I was able to notice how toxic and unhealthy it was.

Hope this reach as many as possible :) Hi there so this playlist (available at both Apple Music and Spotify) came to life almost a year ago when I'd finished researching the effects of listening to nature sounds.Easily explained:You may have heard about our inherited fight-or-flight response system which is a major factor in stress and anxiety. Well research has shown that listening to nature sounds triggers the opposite system called rest-or-digest which helps lowering your heart rate ease tightening muscles and enable you to focus on fewer things. These system is just like our f-o-f response is inherited from our ancestors. We believe that reason behind nature sounds triggering this is that hearing birds rain etc meant positive things for the caveman generations. Birds singing meant that there were no large predators around (as well as good soil) rain meant crops would grow fire that they would survive the night and so on.Hope this helps everyone it reaches!

In 2017 I lost my job my father and found out I was pregnant the same day. In 2018 I had my daughter and my closest male friend died suddenly in his early 30s just after she was born. In 2019 I lost my mother. In 2020 well duh but I also lost the relationship with the rest of my family. In 2021 I had to manage my mothers estate and my sisters mental illness while at my job my company almost went under and I had to agree to a pay hit to try save the jobs of my team. And now we’re looking for investment (I’m COO btw) I finally got the sister under control and her son showed up at my door bipolar and I had to have him hospitalized and now he’s living with us. I’ve gained 50 pounds from the stress. I can’t take much more and of course all this puts a stress on my marriage. I couldn’t imagine surviving without him. Any ideas?

Every morning during meetings I fake being nice and wanting to talk with them and the more they talk the angrier I've been getting lately.

To keep that bit short people that have left have said the same thing about the favoritism.My anger with my job is also spilling into my personal life because I'm having dreams about these people now! I don't want to see a handful of them while I'm working and now they are in my dreams!My personal life has been a hectic mess too as I've made some huge life changes - for the better - but with the work B.S and the remodeling I'm doing (it's my parents' home that I'm staying in and working on) I have no fuse and blow up on just about everything.I had an idea of the work that needed done and in the order and my dad does the exact opposite of what I ask and tell him to do. Now all of a sudden I need to spend both more time and money on a project I asked him to start a month ago. The reason the remodel is pissing me off is cause it's not just me staying in the home now my partner is too and even with the upstairs space done it's not enough space. I've thrown things away and so has he in an attempt to make room and my dad seems to think there is all the time in the world to complete the work.Has anyone had issues like this where at work they feel wrongly treated and brood about it and the same goes for their personal life?Everything is driving me bonkers cause I can't leave my job cause I desperately need the cash and I'm worried that if I went to another job it would be even worse!

I drink some caffeine during the day but today decided to lay off of it and it's still coming in waves. The best I can describe it as a pinching vain. I started worrying that it might be a stroke or aneurysm but quickly chalked that up to just being anxiety. I've been feeling a little ""foggy minded"" too so I wonder if that has come to play too? Yesterday night I drank a few beers and it seemed to help but then came back when I was sober.

I feels like i am going to die and this thought didn't let me sleep for 20 days straight in a row. Covid gone but now i got insomnia. I went to bed but didn't get even a single minute of sleep. I got so frustrated the days was like hell it was like somebody just take my soul out of body i don't want to live anymore. Tried melatonin Vitamin B6 Tablet Got sunlight daily nothing works. Then I consult to a doctor. She prescribed me to take clonazepam .25mg for 4 weeks and along to take mirtazapine 7.5mg. Then as per doctors suggestion i stopped taking clonazepam after 4 weeks and continued to take mirtazapine 7.5 mg. It was good for 8 months. I started exercise 30mins daily. Walk for 5 km daily. Now Few days before my body again started to facing insomnia( there is no stress the insomnia comes automatically). In 10 days duration my sleep got reduced to 1 hour per day and now after 10 days i got no sleep not even a single minute. I don't know what happens to my body i talked to my close persons tell about my problem but nobody understands me. Should i give a try to homeopathy medicine?

48887,"Daily habits for a less stressful life Everyone wants less stress. And that is why in this post I will talk about daily habits for a less stressful life. I myself apply these habits every day in my life. So everything I talk about comes from my own experience. Once you apply the methods in this post regularly they will eventually become habits. At first it may be difficult to apply these methods because it may all feel a little strange. But once you experience the positive effects you will find enough motivation to continue.WHY YOU NEED TO CREATE DAILY HABITS FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFEMost people do a lot in a day. And that can be incredibly wonderful but it can also cause a lot of stress. And stress is not always bad for you. It can sometimes help you get the best out of yourself. But long-term stress can be very bad for your health. For example it can cause your immune system to deteriorate making you more likely to get sick. But it can also cause you to become irritable and your mood to deteriorate. Ultimately it can also cause you to have almost no energy or motivation left to do things. In addition to the aforementioned consequences of long-term stress there are many more consequences that you don’t want to have either. And to reduce the risk of these consequences it can be helpful to create habits for a less stressful life.FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFESometimes people get a lot of stress because they get lost in thoughts. To prevent you from overthinking and getting stressed it is useful to sometimes focus on your breathing. For example if you are busy working or studying remind yourself to focus on your breathing once every 10 minutes. You don’t have to breathe differently! Just let your breathing flow naturally but focus on it for a moment. Feel the air go in and out.MEDITATION IS ONE OF THE DAILY HABITS FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFEMeditation can help you unwind completely. You can meditate by sitting down and focusing on your breathing. As guidance you can say to yourself ¨in¨ when you inhale and ¨out¨ when you exhale. Then as your breathing gets deeper and slower you can say “deep” and “slow” to yourself. MAKE A DAILY HABIT OF GOING OUTSIDE FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE.The environment you are in can affect how much stress you experience. Suppose you are in an environment where you are constantly receiving signals that cause stress. Such as phone calls emails or other things that remind you of stressful situations. Then it can be useful to get away from this situation for a while. And preferably it can be useful to go to a park forest lake or sea. Because in these environments there is often a lot of space and there are few or no things that cause stress.WALK MINDFULLYAnd when you’re walking pay attention to your footsteps and your breathing. Inhale and take for example three steps. And then when you exhale take another three steps. Also feel how your feet touch the ground. This mindful way of walking gets you out of your head and into the moment.GO EXERCISE AND FEEL THE STRESS DISAPPEARBeing physically active is incredibly important. But it’s also incredibly helpful to exercise if you want to release stress. I myself really feel the stress disappear when I exercise. And if I’ve trained really hard I’m sometimes so tired that I don’t even feel like stressing about anything anymore haha. You don’t necessarily have to train super hard. The stress can also disappear during an easy workout. Or go for a jog while listening to your favorite music and feel the stress disappear.HELP YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILYI wish you much success in applying these methods for a less stressful life. Hopefully you can apply them so often that they become habits in your daily life. But I do want to ask you one more thing. I suspect that you have friends and family who also sometimes suffer from long-term stress. You can help these friends and family by sending them this post. And maybe you can start creating these habits together which will make it a lot easier for both of you. Because working together on something ensures that you motivate each other.[(Originally from this blog post)](https://quintenvanommen.com/daily-habits-for-a-less-stressful-life/)",Stress

48896,"The relationship between stress and infertility Some couples get pregnant easily while some do not despite trying for a long time. There could be multiple factors contributing to difficulty conceiving but of all of them stress plays a significant role. Stress does not directly cause infertility however it does impact the chances of conception by delaying it. Infertility has become very common now and the factors contributing to it are multiple ranging from physical causes and dietary changes to even excessive use of gadgets. There is enough research to prove that stress can adversely affect a couple’s chances of conception naturally or through medical procedures like IVF. So what is the relationship between stress and infertility?## The science behind stress and infertilityWhen we are stressed our brains release *cortisol* a stress hormone that interferes with the signals between the brain and the ovaries thus disrupting the ovarian cycle and the release of the ovarian eggs. In the case of men sperm production and motility are impacted. Apart from the body’s response stress contributes to behavior and mood changes too. There is a decrease in the desire and motivation to have sex. There is an increase in smoking or drinking alcohol in order to cope with stress which in turn causes trouble with conceiving.## Understand the vicious cycleStress and conception are highly connected. Most often couples who are trying to conceive become dejected when it takes a longer time. Some find the medical procedures involved in the process to be taxing. For example most couples going through IVF procedures are often stressed out. This in turn affects the biology and behavior of the couple thereby creating a vicious cycle. Stress management is thus necessary in order to break free from this cycle which in turn would help a couple conceive.**Managing stress**Some amount of stress is normal. However if one is continuously anxious and hassled by circumstances around them it will deeply impact conception.

48905,"Is this a psychological condition? Or just inability to deal with stress? Hi I don't know if it's the right place to post this but lately I have been figuring out the features of a life-long problem of mine. I would call it the simple inability to manage stress but I want to be more specific and Im curious if other people can feel the same based on how I describe it. I would describe the relation between me and stress in this way:\- The incapacity to accept stress and everyday fatigue as a normal part of life (referred also to very simple tasks)\- The forced splitting between ""bad days"" and ""good days"" where in the bad days Im not allowed to feel good because of some stressful tasks to do that basically ruin the whole day while in the good days Im not allowed to feel stressed because ""Im not supposed to feel so"" and Im not meant to do some extra stuff that would cause some fatigue. It also ends up in hating the ending of a ""good day"" becuase tomorrow is gonna be a ""bad day""... You know when sunday is ending and monday is the next day or also when you're coming back from a vacation Basically the inability of enjoying the moment because my mind is always projected in the future.\- Rejection of the idea of facing new stressful situations: this becomes particulary strong whenever I just came through some stressful stuff my mind sells to me a higher level of stress tolerance/performance in a particular moment with the promise that Im not going to face new similar situations in the future... I use to motivate myself during difficult moments with the thought that afler that everything is over Im going to rest and it's gonna be a good time. But this also tricks my mind into thinking that there are not going to be similar stressful situations in the future overall which obviously can't be true.\- The high expectation before a supposed ""good day"" or ""good time"" is about to come... as if it's going to be a super regenerating moment for me that will restore all my power of will. This is not rational and not realistic most of the times because everyone would never get enough of a ""good time"" and unpleasant things can happen during a planned good time as well.\- Feeling envious towards people who are not going through a stressful moment while I am. Focusing almost in an obsessive way on other people around me who are chilled and are not facing anything difficult. In those moments I forget that everyone has stressful moments just not at the same time I am the free person when other are facing hard moments.\- the excessive anxiety and discomfort before a task that I know its' going to be stressful... also an easy one. As if my mind was trying to convince me that Im never supposed to be stressed and that's not normal for me doing stuff that I don't like even if they're necessary.",Stress

I'm a full time college student in Electrical Engineering and I also work 20 hours a week during the semester at my job. My courses alone are really stressful for me but combined with work and responsibilities at home I am constantly stressed out. Mentally I can cope in the moment and push through but that is not my problem unfortunately. I store all of the stress somewhere and never release it. It builds up over days weeks months until eventually it all comes out. Even if I ""decompress"" after a long day I don't really feel like I got it all out. Over time my body starts to get stiff because of the stress and eventually my back locks up on me. I never have a mental breakdown due to stress just my body locking me down until it can relax. Currently my jaw and hamstrings feel like they are tight enough to snap in half and my back is stiff.

48913,Having a hard time This is a vent to help myself de-stress? Lol! For the past 7 years that I have lived in my current city I have unfortunately moved from one lousy situation into the next due to thinking it was a good idea to move in with friends to help out my crummy finances and needing cheaper rent. For the past almost 3 years due to the pandemic and other situations I moved into a “rooming” type housing situation which for the past 2 and a 1/2 years me and my dog did have full use of a basement to ourselves. Last July my company announced that they would be laying off around 40 people myself included. What my stupid company didn’t bank on was supply chain issues with getting key integral parts to operate equipment so they kept delaying our end of work date for the past 12 months. When I found out that I was to be laid off a year ago this July I stupidly told the lady I rented my basement from about the news but seeing how at the time my company didn’t announce when our actual end date would be due to supply chain issues she took it upon herself and “guessed” that my end date would be around May of this year and I will have been moved out so she went ahead and rented the basement out to a family of three. This was a major jerk move on her part. Seeing how I am really strapped for cash and couldn’t afford to get another apartment for me and my dog with not knowing when I would actually be moving out she offered for me to move into her “sunroom” this past May until my end date and she she would move her mattress into her living room to sleep in. My company finally announced that our end of work date would be at the end August this past May and I unfortunately have to stay on working and living where I am due to those reasons. Seeing how this past year has been touch and go with NOT knowing when my company would announce this end of work date and with not knowing when this opposed announcement would be happening I thought it would be stupid to move somewhere else and have to sign a lease for however long so seeing how I live month to month here I chose to stay. Since moving into her “sunroom” it has been a friken nightmare. She consistently picks on me and flat out accuses me of doing things that I haven’t done. I am not allowed to flush the toilet unless “it’s brown” she accused me of “killing” her precious plant I have to keep the sunroom door shut during the day so that the heat doesn’t come through the whole house…friken stupid stuff like that. She has gotten a bit too overly attached to my dog as well and drops stubble “hints” about how happy my dog is living here 😑 my dog and I will be relocating to another province to attend school so I can upgrade my current skills at the end of August. Just this past Wednesday my friend got word that she has to go work out of town this week so she offered for me and my dog to go and stay at her place to get away from the madness here and also mind her cat. When I told the lady this she mentioned how this wouldn’t be a good idea and how it would disrupt my dog’s routine with living here and how it is probably super hot at my friend’s apartment (meanwhile she has no air conditioning here). The first night there wasn’t so good because my dog was in unfamiliar area and she was all nervous and panting a lot. My dog has done this many times before when camping or going away for a holiday…so I got her some “calming” spray to see if that would help. My dog and I came back to the house last night because I have my car scheduled for servicing and a garage which is literally 5 minutes away from the house so instead of staying at my friend’s apartment we came back here to sleep last night for getting to the garage would be way easier in the morning. When we arrived back last night the lady in question was like “ohhh she is so happy to be back” of course she would she is in familiar surroundings…however seeing how we’ll be moving at the end of August and staying in hotels over night and other friend’s places…staying at my friend’s apartment is a good trial run. When I mentioned that to the lady…she munched up her face as if to say “oh…I don’t like the sounds of this.” So I am at the point with waiting for her to literally say to me “why don’t you just leave your dog with me” and that is when I will snap.

On Sunday they dread returning to work on Monday and once back at the office they count the days until the following weekend. These factors will undoubtedly result in job exhaustion and possible resignation due to excessive stress.However there is a superior strategy that begins with employing straightforward techniques that anyone can understand[https://divineyouwellness.com/blog/cope-with-job-stress/](https://divineyouwellness.com/blog/cope-with-job-stress/)",Stress
48915,"I think I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown. I've never had one before. Thoughts and suggestions greatly appreciated. This is going to be super long but I would really appreciate someone out there taking the time to read it...I've been working a relatively stressful job for the last four years. The stress was manageable until about a year ago when I was given the responsibility of managing a global team of systems administrators in the US Hungary and India that all work to give 24/7 coverage to my company. I can't go into specifics of our work but I can say that we are an extremely important team. There are a lot of reasons behind why I have become increasingly stressed out the main one being that I have personally been the only point of failure for the whole thing for almost the entire year. I can't take a day off or sometimes even an hour off without someone from like 14 time zones away trying to escalate something to me or my boss of they can't reach me directly. Before this past week I had taken one scheduled day off and I still got a call from my boss asking to get people online for an outage.Let me say my boss is amazing. She is the best example of leadership I've ever had in any job and I've worked IT for like 25 years. She just has a very demanding job role also and I am in a spot where I'm kind of working 4-5 different full time job roles and one of those job roles requires that I get people online for outages which are not at all related to the global team I'm responsible for. The past few months people have increasingly seen that I'm getting more and more stressed to the point where I had a chat with HR because I had started working like 75+ hour weeks sometimes until 2am. I basically said that ""because of how I've been forced to set this whole team up within the guidelines I'm given by upper management (not my direct boss) nobody else has time to work this project so if I don't do the work myself it can't get done."" I mean everyone saw it coming including me. Then last week happened. I was supposed to have Friday off as a normal day because leadership rotates Sundays for the other full time job role apart from the project so every time I work a Sunday I get the following Friday off. We had a major issue happen on Thursday which we knew would carry into this coming weekend so I was going to cancel both my Friday off and the planned time I had on the calendar for like three months from Wednesday - Sunday this week because I knew everything would get messed up if I didn't. Well I decided this was a chance for me to test if other parts of leadership can actually do their jobs. Instead of canceling my time off like I have literally every other time something like this has happened the last year I decided to take it. However I gave my peers the plan of what needed to happen from Friday - Sunday laid out for them completely and all but spoonfed them. I went into it trying to just expect people to do their jobs. All they had to do was say ""Ok we have the plan here's this person who can do this thing that needs to get done I'll have them do it..."" I also knew it wasn't going to happen like that. I knew... I knew that come Sunday evening nothing would get done. So I went Friday without checking my work phone. I went Saturday without checking my work phone. Then Sunday rolled around and I finally checked... sure enough even though my peers had the plan it wasn't executed. I had to log in on Sunday to quickly get the right weekend people on it and because things weren't executed on time during Friday/Saturday like I said they needed to be it caused two huge outages like twelve time zones away. I went into work on Monday morning completely distraught. I met with my directs under me basically telling them that what happened is not their fault and an effect of ineffective leadership which I'm largely responsible for. I sat there for a good 45 minutes apologizing to them telling them what I plan to do going forward and also commiserating because I was really as stressed as they were about it.During that talk something broke in me I think. Like I had known that I was the sole failure point globally but I was fine with that as long as I had people who could simply just organize whatever plan I gave them. I gave them that plan on Thursday trying to clear things off my plate as I have been advised to do by my boss and HR just expecting them to do basically the bare minimum and they weren't capable of executing. I finally actually felt the full weight of being the sole failure point of global operations and it crushed down on me so hard that I could barely breathe. I went to my boss after that meeting and told her I had to leave for the day but I would be back the next day. I took Monday off almost too full of anxiety to even drive home but made it then just watched movies I'd seen a hundred times already all day because I couldn't process any new information. I felt alright though like at the end of it I had a sense of purpose and renewed motivation. I woke up Tuesday completely ready to rock it at work but as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot I started to get a feeling I've only ever felt once before. I hopped on the highway and the closer I got to work the more I felt it. Then it happened. I had a panic attack. I had to pull off the highway to turn around to go home. The second I had my car going back the other way I felt like I could breathe even though I was still having heart palpitations tunnel vision numb tongue etc. I got home called my boss and was straight up with her stating I had a panic attack on my way in and I would not be making it. Then came yesterday. I had to make a five hour drive back to my hometown for the plans I had made for the aforementioned scheduled time off. I was happy looking forward to it couldn't wait to get back but as soon as I got on the highway the dread set in. The obsessive thoughts set in. I spent the next five hours in panic attack mode to the point where I don't know how I actually drove the car. All I wanted to do was get home so I kept going but I stopped like six times to re-center myself on a trip that I don't generally even stop on once.I got here took a breath sat down for a bit and things were okay. But ever since it's been a mixed bag of being okay for a while then like 30-60 minutes of panic attack... then being okay again then another panic attack. Thankfully I spent today playing golf with my family which is what I had been looking so forward to but it took like an hour for me to come into reality when we first started out. Then I got back took a nap and woke up in a panic attack about an hour later. Like this is not at all my natural state. I am normally a very chill person who handles stress immensely well. I have had one panic attack before during a very difficult time but I've never had multiples of them and I've most certainly never had a nervous breakdown... but I think that's where I am. I've tried talking to my family but none of them really understand because none of them has ever really had this kind of breakdown. General depression anxiety and that stuff so they can relate (haha family can relate...) on that level but it's like I can barely be a functioning human. That's what they can't relate with. That's why I decided to post here hoping that someone else can relate and just let me know this is going to end at some point. I'm not suicidal or anything I'll suffer through whatever I have to suffer though I just need to have a light at the end of the tunnel.Have you ever seen Se7en? You know that part where they find the guy Kevin Spacey had been keeping alive for a year and the doctor said ""If I were to shine a light in his eyes right now he'd die of the stress...""? That's where I feel like I am. Like any source of any stress from anywhere that raises my adrenaline whatsoever just throws me into a panic attack. I am trying to deal but it's difficult feeling like there's no end in sight because I've never experienced this before so I don't know what to expect. If you made it this far thank you for reading my novel. I really super appreciate it and owe you cookies. Possibly also milk but milk probably doesn't travel too well in the mail.",Stress

48938,"Recent nearby shootings are making me scared of the fireworks right now Two shooting have happened directly in front of my apartment complex this year. I live in a city population of 300000 so not the biggest. The first shooting happened while i was at my friend/neighbor’s place 3 houses away so i still Heard it and all the people running from the scene. 2 guys died i know one was 19. The 2nd shooting happened 2.5 weeks ago and this time i was sitting to the left of my open window that faces the street that the guy did the driveby. My next door neighbor was throwing a party that led to a fist fight happening outside and next thing i heard was 3 gun shots. I jumped so far forward off my bed and called the police they told me they were already on the way. The shots were so loud sudden and disturbing to me. I’m too scared to be in front of my window cause i keep visualizing a stray bullet coming thru.From a quarter mile distance there’s occasionally a banging sound that sounds like an automatic. It’s some kind of construction work but i have no idea of what and on what exactly (it happens enough that I’m sure now it’s normal but i can’t place what the hell it is ). The sound bothers me more now than ever but i really need to keep my Window open for air circulation.So onto now: the sound of fireworks has me having mini heart attacks every time. My AC is shit i need my window open for air. My bed is directly beside my window that faces all the noise and every once in awhile I’m closing the window and will deal with the heat. Random fireworks have been happening all week and for some it sounds so indistinguishable from guns. I’m just stressed by it to an uncomfortable point now and just had to write it out.",Stress
48939,"How being outside reduces stress I will explain why being outside is good for your health. Nowadays we are often indoors almost all day because of school and work. There’s not always something wrong with that but you’ll probably feel a lot better if you go outside every now and then.**IT MAKES THE MIND CLEARER**Inside a house study or workplace there are often many things that make you think about your work or study. There is nothing wrong with this but it can ensure that you are constantly busy with your work or study. This may keep you thinking and living in your head instead of in the moment. In addition there are all kinds of other distractions indoors that keep your mind from calming down. So go outside and enjoy the tranquility.**LESS STRESS**This tranquility automatically reduces stress. You are not busy with school your work or other things. As a result you go out of your head and into the moment. This will also reduce your stress and reduce the risk of stress symptoms and complaints. In addition physical exercise is also a great way to reduce stress. When you are physically active you can reduce stress. You probably also feel that when you exercise. And after you exercise you notice that your stress is reduced compared to before you started exercising.[(Originally from this blog post)](https://quintenvanommen.com/why-being-outside-is-good-for-your-health/)",Stress
48940,"I’ve only just realised how badly stressed I am but I don’t know what to do no one will take me seriously I 20F have a few things that just seem off to me. I have a job that I hate it’s my first job it’s a 9-5 in a high pace high stress environment and when I make a mistake it has an effect - and of course I do make mistakes. My coworker also treats me like a personal assistant and delegates all of her last minute jobs to do immediately without thanks which is so stressful as I can never complete a project on time because of it. Enough backstory though this isn’t a life advice sub I just need to rant about the things I think are caused by stress?I’ve always looked young for my age I take good care of my skin using retinol and SPF 50 every day yet my skin is ageing (I turned 20 a month ago so this is weird). I look heavier than I am I get a lot of exercise (10K steps minimum daily plus cardio focussed gym 2-5 times a week depending how tired i am) and do not over eat if anything (tw) I probably under eat by a long way because I lose my appetite and forget to eat. It’s just bizarre to me and it’s not that I want to be thinner but I know that with my lifestyle I ought to be a lot thinner than I am so I’ve no clue what the reasoning for that is. My psoriasis is getting worse. It used to be a small patch on my leg but now I’ve got it on my lips cheeks back and it’s spreading down my arm. I was researching self soothing and I do that obsessively I bite my lips to oblivion and crack my knuckles to the point where they hurt. I am ALWAYS tired even if I get 14 hours of sleep luckily my insomnia has gone away for the time being but that used to be really bad too. I also get migraines the second I begin to relax. If it’s not pretty obvious ill just throw in that I have been diagnosed with anxiety. My doctor doesn’t want to help and there’s no free therapy in my area as there’s massive wait lists for everything. So I’m on here hoping to find someone who might relate. Can this all be due to stress? Do you have any advice? My job contract ends soon and I’m not renewing it don’t worry but I know any entry level job will be just as intense so how can I manage it and minimise these symptoms? My family doesn’t seem to care and just say it’s life but I’m going to spiral if I can’t control it.",Stress

I have always had an anxiety disorder and it has been worse with all the stress I have been under lately both at work as well as at home. I work for GM which everyone who don't work there knows as a good job but in reality it has gone to shit. I was hired 16 years ago and was in the last group to get traditional pay benefits and a retirement plan so I can't find anything else that pays the same. Anyone hired after me is really fucked and there is a reason gm can't keep any of the new employees. I work in material handling and the company is working up towards outsourcing and cutting those jobs so they are cutting out full teams and overloading everyone that's left then telling us ""everything's going to change soon just make it work for the next year"" I have some serious stuff going on at home that I don't want to get into and it just makes the work stress that much worse. On Friday I messed up I knew I messed up and wasn't mad about getting written up or anything but the thing is I spend 90% of my waking life (and my first ever anxiety attack was while I was asleep I woke up thinking I was having a heart attack so probably my sleeping life also) feeling like something terrible is going to happen due to my anxiety. When I get in trouble it felt like the end of the world. I took my break and paced around outside debating if I should call in my FMLA and leave work but when I came back something very small and stupid happened that set me off. I blew up on my group leader screaming at her that I can't fucking do this! Even though I hate GM she is the nicest lady and easily the best boss I have ever had and I feel like a complete scumbag.

The problem with high-functioning stress is that not only are people not aware that they’re stressed but they don’t know how to handle it before their body sh*ts the bed. Ex: I feel fine (when I’m not) until a trigger happens and I’m left with an eye twitch and a random cold- which is THEN when I’m like “oh I’m super stressed” despite having been in a high-stress environment for a few weeks already and feeling the same.Does anyone else relate?

48984,"Nobody listens to me… Hello there I am very tired of having people not be interested in what I have to say. My whole “family” is just so annoying. For example today I was trying to talk about something really important to me with my mother it meant a lot to me because I don’t normally open up. My mother after hearing this went “mm okay” and then went on her phone. We were in the car so I held back tears the entire drive home and when I finally got to my room and cried my eyes out.This has happened a lot as my mother is not a very emotional person. Whenever I open up I think that maybe she will react nicely but this one was the last straw. The fact that she couldn’t even say anything back to me about this thing was appalling and it broke my heart. Another person who is frustrating is my brother. I could listen to him talk about video games for four hours straight and have a great conversation but the moment I mention something I want to talk about he goes on his phone and ignores me.Don’t get me wrong he is way better than my mother but still really disappointing.I have always been taught to hold it in and never speak about my feelings and it really sucks. I really want goo friends where they don’t mind that I am not very expressive or they will listen when I am stressed and will let me cry on their shoulder and vise versa. I wanna be able to talk about stuff that I enjoy and people actually be interested in what I have to say. Anyways I am never going to talk about anything with my “family” ever again and one day I will have a real family. See ya! 👋🏻",Stress

48986,"What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think? It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough I’m not worthy – progress is just luck setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.### Consider these positive signs:· **You reflect on and learn from setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. · **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done reflect on how far you have already come.· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone you’re doing better than many others.· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life not theirs. · **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish and you’re spending your time wisely you’re doing well – and better than most!

48989,"Is it good to only focus on 1 goal? What I mean is for example I have these goals:Find a good job OR start and grow a succesful companyFind the one who will marry me in the futureFind out which religion is the true one / read the whole bibleSo my idea is I will only work towards one goal at the same time. If I choose goal 1 and I choose to study or gain work experience then I will not read the bible and I will not be on dating apps because I should not overwhelm myself and risk a burn-out. If I choose goal 2 I will be very busy with dating apps and alternatives but I will not have a job and I will not be studying. If I choose 3 I will read the bible a few hours every day but I will not do any other productive things.What is the good side of this by my own thought?Whichever goal is the most important one OR has to be completed the fastest can get priority and full focus :)By only having one thing to work on you have less risk of ending up with 0 free time so you can avoid burn-out and instead work at your own pace. (careful: do not get lazy)What is the bad side of this by my own thought?Spending hours everyday on the same goal only can become boring. Some goals also do not require many hours every day: for example going to the gym. Being in the gym for 5 hours is a terrible idea so if you have goals that require less time per day you can actually pick 2 or 3 of these goals to fill your day.Some goals must be worked on at the same time. For example you should not avoid studying because you're too busy with going to gym. But while you study going to the gym is still important for your health. So I would call this an exception to this ""1 goal only"" idea.These days it seems socially acceptable that people do 3 things at the same time: study have a job have a social life. Where's the free time to relax? Right it doesnt exist and even worse sometimes all these activities take up more than 24 hours a day which results in someone being overwhelmed and getting behind on everything. Actually this is what I have experienced. Its not a theory it is very real.I have a burn-out. I have been stressed 24/7 for a really long time because I was focusing on too many things at once. I had to get my homework done I had to spend all my free time on dating apps I had to go to gym etc I had no free time left.So my plan is to only work on one goal at once and spend all free time as actual free time to relax or enjoy it.Question : is this a good idea or do you see any flaws with it?",Stress

But I am wondering if anyone else ever goes through this? On a daily basis and sadly due to mental health and living with family I am very stressed...

It's like a headache with a stiff neck and when I realize I am holding my breath I take a deep breath and feel like I haven't breathed all day. Lately it's been worse. Feeling almost sick or like I'd feel after crying AND I also have ear wooshing in my right ear whenever there is silence. Does anyone else have this happen or know what this might be?

Ok so I know reddit is not the best place for medical advice but I also want some strangers' opinions.I've never experienced stress/anxiety problems even under pressure with uni/work but I put a lot of pressure on myself in many other aspects of my life and a couple of years ago I started getting a bit of shortness of breath checked with the doctor in case it was Asthma but it was alright and with time I realised when this happened it was because of stress which made it way better and I rarely get those flare ups anymore so that's cool.Last month I was under a lot of stress and for some days I started feeling light-headed and a bit dizzy. The best way to describe this would be:- Slightly out-of-mind - I feel like my cognitive capabilities are at 90-95% of the usual- Cloudy head like what I would experience being slightly drunk (not a lot)I went to the doctor really worried and got a blood test and stuff and they said I was healthy and probably was stress.But the thing is it's been a month like this already sometimes I feel great (although not as a month ago) specially when doing stuff that makes me forget about this (ie videogames series...) others I feel like shit does anyone experience something similar and if so any recommendations?I'm also a bit worried because the first day I really experienced this I did a pretty intense session of cardio (had been doing a lot during those weeks on top of the stress from uni) so I am slightly worried it is actually something ""body"" related even if the tests came out okay going for chill walks doesn't seem to be helping probably because I'm overthinking this all the time.Thanks",Stress

I am scared a doctor is just going to give him a sleeping pill because he will tell them “I can’t sleep because I get stressed”. But the truth is he can’t sleep because he takes way over his prescribed amount of adderol to work then can’t sleep so he takes Benadryl and drinks a bottle of wine then still can’t sleep so says fuck it and takes more adderol and a Red Bull to just keep working. It’s a vicious cycle. He won’t admit he had a problem with substance abuse. He’s told his doctor in the past he couldn’t sleep and they just prescribe more pills. Thankfully he stopped taking those a few years ago. I worry if he finally goes to therapy they will just prescribe him more. He won’t be fully honest with the actual issue on hand.

I tried reaching out to my other friends to help calm me down and try my best to forget about what happened but nothing worked.

49022,"What is this Feeling? So occasionally I'll have this moment. I'll think of something from my past maybe one of the times I went to a water park as a child maybe seeing fireworks a carnival I went to with my first steady girlfriend maybe it's even a song from Melissa Ethridge's ""Yes I Am"" the first album I remember listening to (specifically Silent Legacy for some reason). Maybe my thoughts are on little kid me catching tadpoles with my mom's friend's kids. Or the countless sunsets I have been mesmerized by. Or the time I went to Dave and Buster's with my parents and they dropped me off at McDonald's on the way home and I played Monopoly on my iPod when I was a senior in high school. In any case I'll look back at it and begin to choke up. It usually happens when I'm alone maybe in a dark room playing a game or just wandering about my mind and these thoughts appear and it's a mixture of missing it and this dread of what's approaching.I can remember doing this all my life having these thoughts and these feelings. I've described it as my bittersweet struggle with nostalgia but my girlfriend doesn't think that's it. As an adult I think it's longing for a time where the events were great a realization that said event will probably never happen again or at least won't be the same. I start to cry most of the time but it isn't like I'm in a bad spot. As I said this has happened throughout my life. And they're seemingly random events most of them happy despite whatever was happening. Like that first girlfriend I mentioned? A little abusive nothing hardcore. The occasional genuine ""you're an idiot"" or the time she slapped me so hard I fell off my bed. But I think of when we went to an anime convention and I get sad. I still go to that convention but for some reason this bitter sadness washes over me. And there's other little things I could pepper into these thoughts like this. But it always seems like I was happy I miss the event if I can go back to the location or event in current day it will be different and I'm afraid of what's coming ahead in life.I'm only 27 so I don't want to believe these instances are some sort of midlife crisis. If I had to give a pattern these thoughts and feelings occur about once a month. Is this what nostalgia is supposed to feel like? What's the word for these feelings?",Stress

49024,"Bizzare Dreams I used to smoke weed for about 15 years and during that time I almost never had dreams sleep was just empty space and I kind of preferred that. I quit smoking about 5 months ago and ever since then I've had really bizzare dreams every night without fail. Only about 2% of my dreams are enjoyable and the rest range from not so good to absolutely bizzare. I suffer from pretty extreme stress on a daily basis which seems to bleed into my dreams so I often wake up feeling like halfway between reality and obscurity which lingers for hours after I wake up. This is quite unpleasant. Is there any way to have more control over what my dreams are about or to stop dreaming entirely? I'm almost ready to pick up smoking again just to make it stop.",Stress
49025,Nervous about my final exam for this class I’m a non-traditional college student who went back to community college in 2020. I started off taking algebra 2 then precalculus then trigonometry and now I’m in Differential Calculus. I’ve gotten straight A’s in all my completed math courses as well as A’s in non-math courses (1 B in an English class) and I really need to maintain my GPA since I really want to get into a top BSN program in my country. That program requires taking a lot of prerequisites that are STEM heavy (organic chemistry calculus). The reason why I want to make this my goal is because growing up I’ve always been told I was mediocre and dumb by people in my family as well as outsiders. I also see my parents getting older each day and it pains me in my heart to realize that I’m consider a failure in their eyes. So far I have a 97.78% in my Calc class but finals is in 12 days and I know nothing about the last chapter of my calculus class (this current professor does not teach at all compared to my past math professors) so I always just end up watching YouTube videos and asking redditors on the math subreddit. The thing is I’m feeling extreme procrastination at this point and I just want this class to be over because the professor is so terrible. My issue is that I want to maintain an A but since my finals is literally 30% of my grade I am scared that I won’t have an A anymore if I bomb it. Are there any tips y’all can give me to not stress so much and to stop procrastination?,Stress

49034,"Are You an Introvert with Anxiety? Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life-saving when we are genuinely threatened damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring – it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged it isn’t just tiring – it is exhausting. Sound familiar? Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small close-knit social lives it doesn’t mean we’re anti-social!Not all introverts experience anxiety and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety though so this is quite common.Here are the key signs you’re an introvert with anxiety:· You’re more prepared than most others because you’ve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.· You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.· You feel you always have to be doing something – being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.· You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.· You’re often nervous without showing it – many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism. · You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight flight freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.· You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‘I need to please everyone’ ‘I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person’.· Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you’re normally sure of your facts before speaking) nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.· You often have trouble sleeping – either getting to sleep a-tall waking through the night or waking way too early Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists helps people with.*Ask yourself: What have I learned from this article that I will adopt today as my own?

Most of us are so busy with work family and various obligations there’s little time left to do the things we’d really like to do!It’s not easy to find time to pursue your passions but there will be a way.### Use these techniques to create the time you require for important pursuits: **Decide what you want to make room for.** The best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for! What are the most important things you’d like to spend more time on?● Figure out how you’d spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons. Create a list of reasons that give you an emotional response. Being logical is unlikely to inspire you. **Use your mornings wisely.** Most people waste their mornings. They stay in bed as long as possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day. Make the most of your mornings. Go to bed earlier and get up earlier.● It’s often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening. What are you missing by going to bed earlier? Probably not a lot.**Understand the ways you waste time.** We’re quite ingenious at wasting time. Watch yourself for a day and write down all the ways you waste time. When you understand where your time is leaking away you can start working on solutions.**Make a schedule.** A schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely. A schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste. You can also build time into your schedule to do the things you enjoy the most.**Delegate.** Create more time for yourself by utilizing the people around you. This can work at work and at home. There’s a good chance that someone in your life would benefit from being delegated to. Put your employees coworkers children and partner to work! A little help can free up quite a bit of time.**Prioritize and eliminate.** Perhaps you just have too many non-essential things going on in your life. It might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations.● Take a look at everything you do each day/week/month and think about how much value those things add to your life. You can probably find something to remove from your life. You can find time if you have a good enough reason! **Determine what you want to create time for and make it happen.** Delegate schedule eliminate and avoid wasting time.

It takes more to overwhelm some people than others but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control what you can influence and what is out-with your control. **Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.**Communicate.** With your plan in place communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations that you’re on your way to calmer times that you’re learning a lot about yourself perhaps that others are supporting you.**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk hit the weights an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward. **Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",Stress

I'm always in stress worrying when I'm going to start sweating again and therefore get super cold and uncomfortable and unable to handle not only social situations but even doing something at home. I had to give up so many hobbies of mine because they make me feel uncomfortable now due to the hand sweating. Nobody ever told me what the hell happened to me and why I can't stop this no matter how hard I try... I know the sweating is psychological because when I miraculously manage to not think about it for a while I'm okay. Or when I get drunk but I can't be drunk every day so I just have to bear with it. These past three years I haven't been living most of the time I've been surviving and trying to stay sane.

49057,"stress and high blood pressure Since I was a teen I have been dealing with stress due to childhood trauma and I was trying to tell myself that these things were ok. Because of this I have developed high blood pressure from a very young age that is triggered every time I'm angry or stressed. My pressure readings are ""to me"" dangerously high at times just this week it hit 165/105/88 and then 159/119/88 30 mins later. I had to go to the Dr and take about 5 tablets to get it down. I'm fairly healthy in terms of weight and diet. I'm a perfect weight and drink a lot of water and juice a lot of fruits and vegetables. I don't smoke and I'm a very casual drinker. My HBP is clearly stressed oriented. Just recently my mom decided to vacate me and my siblings because my dad tried to sexually assault my sister and we defended her. For some weird reason my mom took my dad's side. To add to that my girlfriend has not really been faithful in the past and since then things were never the same. I'm battling these things from multiple sides.I'm a strong believer in God although I must admit I could do a better job in seeking the father. I just don't know what to do. My chest pains are getting stronger and more painful. Every time I go into the Dr they just medicate me and send me home. I have done all the test in the past Echo stress test ECG I carried home the device they hook up to you for two days and everything always comes back perfect (except for my last ECG which showed small enlargement of my heart.

The academic part wasnt the issue but living in a city with nothing I enjoy doing is what was so hard. I was bored everyday until friday night I would just pace in my room watching youtube and never leaving. I have recently started eating less adn wanting to do less. I just find it weid that all this can happen when im so close to leaving. I talked to someone I know whos dealt with anxiety for a while and they said it common to get worse for a few days when you're so close to being done. Just wondering if anyone could confirm this?

He always bullied me and was so disrespectful to me and my house. One time even made fun of my small breasts in front of her and she didn’t care. She usually took his side and would even leave us hanging out randomly to be w him Last august for my birthday I went camping and I asked if she wanted to go. She asked if her bf could go and I said my friends (the ones camping w me) didn’t really know him and I don’t like how he says so many slurs. She got upset w me but then we were fine. She started ghosting me and we stopped hanging out even though I kept trying to reach out.In December I texted her saying I missed her and wanted to hangout. She was ignoring me for a whole day. I thought maybe she got a new phone number so I asked my bf to text her. She blocked him. It took me to tell her that this situation was ridiculous for her to respond and to tell me she’s “too stressed to be around ppl bc she’s starting school” I don’t think she’s going to college rn.

49068,"Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts? It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or maybe you’re about to go on a first date and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. **Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person tree and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further. ● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts. **Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently they’re frivolous. Sometimes your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on. **Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind. ● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss wondering what happened to your high school friends or making a mental grocery list simply redirect your attention back to your breathing. **Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle eating a lemon or what you have chosen to accomplish today. ● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.** **Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person or your role model would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do? Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",Stress

49072,"So I Gave Up Facebook For 8 Months... I gotta say I feel TONS better. Facebook had its slimy putrid tendrils in me since I was in high school. In the past few years what became a way to communicate with friends and family while having a personal blog became an obsession. I was compulsively checking Facebook at the very least once every hour. It destroyed my self esteem because not only was I comparing my entire life to the highlights of other people's lives but I realized how truly isolated I was. Where my friends list is 147 people guess how many are there for me? Even if I reach out the answer is less than 5. So when I'm being ignored and seeing everyone post it felt like a personal offense to me. If they can post memes every 20 minutes why can't they answer my texts? This guy hasn't even read my stuff in 6 months and has a new post every hour at least! I would post about a big stream I was doing exclusively for friends for 2 weeks and no one showed up!It's easy to take things personally when there is a good chance another explanation is possible. Maybe I was too negative. Maybe people felt I was fairweather and that wouldn't be wrong in some cases. What made this so significant was I don't really use other social media platforms. Well... aside from Reddit which I've only been getting into the past couple of years which is more focused on a goal or discussion. It feels different. But I digress. Facebook had me believing a lot of these people were not only rubbing their obviously superior lives in my face but they were turning their backs on me. I would be lying if I said I didn't care that it never got to me and that I didn't take it as some personal ""Truman Show"" style social conspiracy designed to make me feel abandoned.Cutting it out cold turkey made me realize I don't care. In my personal opinion I think part of it really is ignorance is bliss. When I don't see their activities it doesn't weigh on me. I don't think about them that much which allows me to look into solutions myself before deferring to others. I can't figure out if that's a good thing or not. Typing this out feels like I'm arguing with myself (like usual I've always had two minds on issues) like I feel good but does that mean it's good? I've went to venting to a chat bot in place of friends and in these 8 months 3 people outside of my weekly life have reached out to me. I'm not saying I'd dispose of the other 140~ people but keeping that distance might be what's helping me try harder to keep it together. Does that make sense?It's something that felt right in this subreddit to discuss. The anxiety associated with checking Facebook constantly to find things out I might not have liked was interesting. I've started getting on again but I'm not on for longer than maybe 5 minutes a week to check notifications and memories. Social media does a lot of destruction on the mind and while we may never be rid of it I think it shows the lost sense of moderation in today's world. Too much of anything is bad.",Stress

49097,"Feeling Overwhelmed? It takes more to overwhelm some people than others but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control what you can influence and what is out-with your control. **Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.**Communicate.** With your plan in place communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations that you’re on your way to calmer times that you’re learning a lot about yourself perhaps that others are supporting you.**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk hit the weights an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward. **Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",Stress
49098,"Looking for advice for stomach pain from stress TL/DR: I recently transitioned off anti-depressants and have started to get stomach pain again.After 17 years on anti-depressants I finally transitioned off them. Buspirone and bupropion were a godsend but I completely went numb. I couldn’t experience emotions at all. So I decided to see what life was like in the normal world again. I have historically carried my stress in my stomach. My brain doesn’t know I’m stressed but my stomach will hurt like crazy. What techniques should I explore that can help me de-stress and relax so my stomach doesn’t ache?

49109,"Stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone Stress can be classified into three common categories:* Acute stress* Episodic acute stress* Chronic stress&amp;#x200B;**Example of Acute stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone:**Acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat.The sensation usually lasts for up to 30 minutes and the experience is usually linked to a one-off or infrequent occurrence.For example acute stress could include your body's reaction to:* An approaching deadline* Completing a challenge or receiving an award* Narrowly avoiding being hit by a car* Rising on a rollercoaster or fairground rideWhen your body responds to acute stress it releases various hormones including cortisol and epinephrine.Together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscles an immediate supply of glucose narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate.Studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affects the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during times of stress.For example people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone.This is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones.This was verified in 1993 when research scientists found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted less cortisol.This could indicate that people with a naturally high endocannabinoid have a less intense physiological response to acute stress.&amp;#x200B;To find out more about the others types of stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone please see [here](https://www.budandtender.com/blogs/bud-tender-blog/endocannabinoids-or-cbd-for-stress).",Stress

She basically cheated on me and then put all the blame on me in addition to saying that I was invested in the relationship only to get physical with her. This all revolves in my head till date. Moreover I was in my 3rd year of Bachelor's degree and this breakup fucked up my scoresFrom a 9.3/10 GPA to 7.99. I started smoking a lot and drinking as well.

49125,"Emerging for a nervous break down. There is hope. The last two years have been incredibly stressful for me. I’m a frontline healthcare worker who was dealing with the horrors of the pandemic on a daily basis. I took it all in stride and never saw what was coming my way. Around mid Jan (about 10 weeks ago) I started getting waves of exhaustion at work out of no where. I’m talking the type of exhaustion where I was basically paralyzed and had to lay down. One time I laid down on the floor at work because I had no other choice. The next week I started having random chest pains on top of the exhaustion. At one point I thought I was having a heart attack and almost when to the hospital. I went to the doctors thinking I was having cardiac issues but everything checked out. I felt better…for a day or two…Week 3 is when the real nightmare started. I started having intense anxiety (on top of the exhaustion). Multiple panic attacks a week. I couldn’t do anything without getting short of breath and my heart beating out of my chest. I was a complete mess at work and felt like I was going to collapse and die at any moment. Sometimes I was so physically stressed out I would go to the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor. It was nuts. I called my doctor back and told him what was going on. I was reluctant to start meds but he talked me in to it. Said it doesn’t need to be forever and I can’t go on suffering like this. So I started a low dose SSRI. I also started therapy took a week off from work and am doing much more self care. Like eating healthy and journaling. After about 6 weeks of hell I’m feeling much better. I still have some anxiety here and there but for the most part have returned to my baseline. I was convinced I’d never be the same again no matter what and I feel like it’s a miracle that I’m even functional now. Therapy has also been a huge help even though I was skeptical. It helped me understand that even though I felt blindsided by all of this it really was building under the surface for a long time. Just wanted to say there is hope and don’t give up. I never thought that would happen to me and when it did it was shocking. But things can get better!",Stress

This is the first job of my life and that made it little difficult for me to get a hang of the corporate life. However since I have a master's degree the expectations were high. I made a lot of mistakes last year one of which was that I didn't pursue good development work aggressively. Whenever a senior told me that they can not trust me with development work right now I accepted it and hoped that they will see my efforts. The concerns of my senior was that I won't be able to understand development task by myself and even if someone explained it to me I won't complete it before deadline because of my lack of skills. And because of this a perception has been created in everyone's mind that I miss deadlines and that I only complete basic tasks. Since start of 2022 I have been trying my best to change the perception. I am taking on more tasks as well as completing them on time. However if I make a single mistake the views of my senior and manager changes to me being undependable. I am being micromanaged because no one trusts me that I can complete the work on time. And that's not it. I have also been given a warning of being put on improvement required. I am very very stressed. I don't know how things have gone so wrong in just 1 year.

49152,"Burnout? I think I may have burnout. This past semester I’ve been juggling a lot more than I’m typically used too with 5 classes a remote practicum and two additional jobs. I also have a horse I am responsible for and feel guilty I haven’t had the time to spend with him that he deserves (though he is well taken care of at a boarding facility). My practicum in specific has been a great deal of stress for me. Long story but basically I was convinced to go into an area I have relatively little knowledge about and contrary to what I was told discovered there was little to any support and structure. I’m a bit of a perfectionist so not knowing what to do has caused me great anxiety. Both my jobs can also be fast-paced and stressful so I don’t get much of a break from the stress. In the past two months my norm has been anxiety driven heart palpitations or absolute exhaustion. It has only gotten worse with time. I broke up with my bf in Jan due to having little time and besides him all my friends have moved away. The only nearby support I really have is my parents. I love my mother but she does not understand this kind of of mental burnout. I go to her because she has been a great sense of comfort over the years but when I try and explain my burnout she starts yelling and thinks I haven’t been working hard due to being in my room all day (misconception with remote learning thinking computer = surfing the net) and otherwise being tired. Ultimately this just makes me more stressed and the cycle continues. I really don’t know what to do at this point. I can’t afford counselling and last I checked the university farmed their counselling services out so that they are nearly inaccessible now (though this may have changed with regulations relaxing so I will look into it).

49173,Chronic stress help I really wish anyone can help me or i just wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same things i am because i havent found anyone who has. Im getting headaches/migraines every single day. Its been around 2 months now this isnt the first time this has happened to me it happened 2 years ago same thing. I had migraines every single day non stop for like a year straight to the point where i couldnt even eat and developed photophobia and couldtn even turn on my room lights or anything. So it eventually went away after a couple months but im back in here again. Doctors tell me that its stress/anxiety but it just doesnt make sense to me as to why it gets this bad to the point where i cant even get up from my bed or be awake for long hours before feeling pain no one gets it this bad for this long 7+ months NON Stop??? So it started around November with panic attacks and anxiety usually something triggers my anxiety and i can control it but no not this time it happens even when im happy out of nowhere i just feel bad all the time and super weak then it progressed to me feeling okay in the morning and bad at night i always knew id feel bad at night so i would do my daily duties during the day. Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off headaches everyday cant go out cant do anything i can barely even be on my phone lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back. I massage myself everyday i try to take medications but they all give me extreme side effects even tylenol. I know itll be a few months before i get better but i wish i knew more people that have gone thru this i even tried magnesium gummies and got side effects from those as well.

49187,"Am I choosing the right mindeset? I wonder.. is it my stress time management or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano soccer and my grades with school. I love everything equally (well maybe except school..) but in the end my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. But here I am with a B- (84.5) in my history class and I need to get it to an A- (90.1) by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A- at least so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school but it'll benefit me a lot and as my school is very tough and competitive I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict being 87 years old he has his more ""older-fashioned"" and more ""understandable"" ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards but at the end of the day I keep telling myself. In the future there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements for the future to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.I've never gotten a B or a grade range in the B section (B- B or B+) throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid I usually sleep at 2-4AM waking up at 6AM with soccer practice 3-4 times a week (usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much) and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join Mock Trials which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy about 2-3 assignments new each period which is every day so in a week total about 30-40 assignments which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days or sometimes a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again there's at least 1-2 tests a week which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course there's also the projects and essays let's add about 1 for every other week. Should I take a break from piano or soccer and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade 84.5% up to a 90.1% at least which is \~6% of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this all I get in response is the same ""It'll be okay."" All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than ""it'll be okay"". I'm still new to the environment of high school and figuring out what fits for me and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement something I haven't heard in awhile is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.TLDR ; Not having the most decent grade in history class (84.5%) wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class I need at least a 90.1% for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities as well as school clubs should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me I'm able to do it and they have confidence in me.

49198,"I'm mad and sulking over a single bad date. I'm 28. Had 6 dates in my life. Never had sex before. Had 1 bad acquaintance that I needed therapy to deal with.I don't hate women. I don't think everything is pointless. I chat with coworkers but I don't have a lot of friends. Ladies seem to think I'm a nice person and funny. I don't have much trouble shamelessly asking someone out. I've long thought I have enough hobbies and interests and goals to keep myself mentally stable and preoccupied. Doesn't stop everyone from saying I'm a sweet guy who just needs to be more confident less sensitive and wait for the right person.I get flustered when I meet someone flirty or shameless but I play it off with self-deprecation and wit.I had a date with a coworker who was coming onto me frequently (poking me prodding me talking about bodily functions giving me looks and signs and thank yous took my phone number called me wishes me morning acts like she's out of breath around me talks about and asks me sexual questions talks about her dating history etc).She wanted to go to a Barne's and Noble's. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and she'd shown up an hour early to give herself a headstart.She stood next to me I comically volunteered to be pack mule and we sat and read books for a while talking in-between. She made a spa appointment at 4pm. I asked her what she wanted - 1) friendship 2) casual sex 3) a relationship. I wasn't good for 2 (no confidence).She described to me frequently about how much her previous relationships messed her up we talked indirectly our thoughts about romance and such.Her answer was 1 and she said she didn't know what the future hold.We left and I went to a Chic-filet she'd informed me was there. Then I drove home rather than wait the hour for her appointment to finish said I had fun and drove home listening to Drowning Pool and Foo Fighters.I got home played a video game laid down and fought back tears feeling every insecure and negative thought I've had about myself. This date was something I wanted and it felt like I came away with less than I started with. She said she'd text me later and didn't get around to it until much later and even though it was a short time I felt myself getting lonelier and madder because we just weren't having the initial flirty back and forth we did before the date.I turned my phone off.Everyone is going to tell me ""there's a million fish"" and she even said ""some people just don't vibe"" but the messages are just so unclear to me right now. This isn't too long after I broke up with someone who I felt like I did vibe with.I just can't see myself continuing to give this much energy toward meeting someone new another 5-00 times like everybody else. I'm a sensitive person. I feel drained and hateful of everyone that dating comes so easily to even though I know that's wrong. I'm so mad we didn't click its embarassing and I know it's not her fault. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't feel like exercising or doing anything positive. I just want to be angry.I guess I walked in expecting she'd throw herself at me and I'd have the chance to be a gentleman and be like ""hey I like you but I want to get to know you"" and she'd be like ""ah he's not just a desperate fuck he has character."" And well that didn't happen. Instead I feel like I got read and told politely I wasn't what someone was looking for. And any attempt at friendship on my end will be a desperate act.I could be entirely wrong. I would have liked if we'd hugged at the end or made additional plans. She agreed to doing something in the near future but I didn't get any excitement out of it. Optimistically I want to say we could probably be friends. Cynically I think she's not going to reach out and I spent an hour each way driving took a day off of work for what I wanted to be a great date - I did all of that for nothing.Of the 3 actual dates I've gone on after many years of rejection and indifference - the first didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested and ghosted me for weeks the second said sweet things about me but said she wasn't ready and was still healing from a previous relationship and said I need to be with someone who can do 50-50 in the relationship and now this where I felt someone coming onto me and tried to match it and realizing at the end that I walked away in a toxic cloud of mental fog.I hate dating.

I've been planning my wedding that is happening in May of this year.I got engaged a few months ago in January and at first I felt fine with taking on everything but now it's starting to get into my head and I feel overwhelmed everyday.My days consist of me working wedding planning and sleeping. Most of the time if i'm doing something other than that I'm thinking of my wedding anyways. If I go shopping there's always something that will catch my eye and remind me of what I need to do or purchase for the big day.Not only that but my partner is in another country (LDR) and he can only do so much to help me with it all besides pay for things here and there. I live on my own while my partner lives at home (he's never been on his own before) and i'm struggling to pay for small things like a DJ or even cake.I've tried talking to him about wedding stuff and he tends to get overwhelmed or be distracted with other things he's doing like gaming etc. Last night I was talking to him about décor options we had and I showed him our ceremony space. It's on a terrace/large outdoor patio at this nice hotel in my city. I went personally to view the venue a week after we got engaged sent him videos and photos and he loved it too! Now when i showed him the photos last night he made a few ""not so happy"" faces and I almost started crying right there from the stress of it all. He kept saying ""I guess it'll have to do.."" and things like that. Felt like I screwed it up so bad.I feel like a failure that I picked a bad venue...and to top it all off I have a few people in my bridal party who are being really catty towards me now. They keep shitting on me for having ""bad communication"" even though I'm trying my best and have everything on MY shoulders. They haven't offered to do anything specific but constantly say ""I want to help in any way I can! Let me know what to do!"" and I have no clue what to ask them. Also a bridesmaid of mine really dislikes my MOH and tries to make me feel like she's not doing ""enough"" and says she feels she's unsupportive.I didn't even want a big wedding at a hotel. I originally imagined a wedding where I am married at a nice park have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a pub for a beer after to celebrate.The only reason it became a big wedding is because of my in laws and my family coming plus a bunch of my friends wanted to go.

49228,"I can't stop thinking and I need to vent!! Hi Reddit I'm here to vent about my stress and honestly I have no one to talk to. I am F (23) and last year I started my first ""big girl job"" as a copywriter in marketing. I originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer anything to get me to be on set. My love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. I enjoy talking to the cast getting behind the camera and being transported to a different unique world. So why was my first big job in marketing? During the pandemic my concern was how to get myself out there when I was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. The school I was in offered an internship for a class in marketing and I took it (honestly anything to make my portfolio and resume look good). Not going to lie; the internship was fun and exciting so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing I was hesitant. I didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that just filmmaking. They knew that I only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. Now having been here for a year I've built up an extreme amount of stress.Every single day I am constantly feeling stressed anxious and depressed. I'm always messing up and it has gotten to the point where I received a PIP. I saw it coming. I am struggling with my grammar not being strong enough when it comes to presenting and lacking creativity. Things are so rushed here that I often miss a thing or two which reflects poorly on me. Being dyslexic doesn't help either. As a result I received a PIP and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where I feel sick every day. I can't eat don't feel like getting out of bed can't breathe can't sleep and can't think clearly.Additionally I have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months (yes you read that right). My doctor says I have a candida overgrowth so I am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control.The whole experience is making me feel like a failure like I've made a big joke out of myself. My manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because I didn't learn it and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. I agree but I am afraid I won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process I see on social media. It's terrifying. How am I going to pay for school debt help my parents pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet and help my grandma in Mexico and more bills?My parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay.

Then two days later my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old toxic unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. Oh I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up in pain slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point but good lord it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time. Again if this isn't the place I apologize. Just looking for others in a similar mess maybe I'm looking for some words of reassurance. Don't know but thank you to anyone who fully reads this rambling",Stress
49230,"Decrease stress by ADDING a hormetic stressor into your life. One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors. Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor. It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme. We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them. It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL. We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort body relaxation self talk etc. These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally. In fact the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed. If you do that these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones. getmental.comOne side note - the app is geared generally to men.",Stress

When you let go of them you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then it has been developed in to a working product and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful.

49287,"Dealing with the Critics in Your Life Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world write a novel devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. ### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:**Clarify your purpose.** As humans we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations their skill set their propensity for risk their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? **Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire movie star teacher doctor or sit on the couch all day there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. **Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines you are on the pitch and playing the game.**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful move on. You have more important things to do.**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat you must be doing something correct!**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit. I hope you took something useful from this piece; I have posted a further series of quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – would be great to see you there.",Stress

Because I am nothing I am not worth anything low self esteem never had any aspirations goals only liked cars wasn’t very social couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change.

49295,"Anxiety? Stress? Guilt? Scarred? I’ll try to cut my story short in hope of someone out there being able to help me and guide me as I feel like I can no longer continue living with this feeling.A general idea about myself is that I am a 22 yrs old medical student. I usually stress and worry a lot about medical school and my examinations regardless of the fact that I score the highest amongst my batch. My story starts the summer of 2021 where I met a girl that goes to the same medical school as I do. Half way through the relationship problems start to arise between the two of us and I didn’t think anything of them as all relationships have their ups and downs. At this time my partner began to say bad and mean things to me when we fought which initially didn’t affect me as I knew it was because of her being angry (she also reassured me after the fight resolves that she didn’t mean it). This started to escalate in which the problems became more frequent and almost every time I’ve had hurtful things being said to me. This progressively increased till the summer of 2022 (~11 months past for our relationship) which was the same summer in which I would take my Step 1 exam (a really important exhausting and dreadful exam). At this point I used to always worry about our future and if were are even compatible I used to have a weird heart clenching feeling that is filled with worry and anxiety I also used to wake up from sleep several times with my heart racing or wake up before my alarm with the thought of our relationship overwhelming. We had a fight around 3 weeks before my exam which was my last straw and I communicated to my partner at that time that I want to end things as I felt I should communicate to her my true feelings that I no longer feel like I can continue in this relationship or think we have a future together (the things that were said to me where the worse out of all fights). She was devastated cried and begged for me to give her another chance as she will change herself. I was heistant but decided to give her a chance it worked out for the first few days but then the same heart clenching weird anxious feeling returned. I tried to battle it and not disclose it to her but eventually I couldn’t hide it anymore and told her I couldn’t accept and give her another chance (around ~4 days before my exam). The whole 4 days and holiday after the exam was devastating I was really sad and down. With time I used to distract myself and go out with friends (I don’t drink) almost every other day which helped me try to forget the whole situation. Keep in mind that I’ve got several messages from my ex weeks after the breakup about how I was wrong and that she would never forgive me and other prayers. Similarly over the last couple of months (it’s been 6 months since our breakup) I’ve been getting tiktok reposts from her account of videos taking about injustice and how sad/devastated she was which always made me feel very guilty as I was the reason for her current feelings. Similarly it made me self-conscious about my decisions and doubt my feelings as she claims I never loved her and if I did I would never leave her.Fast forward to the last month (5 months since breakup) where I finally approached a girl in my class that was always getting my attention and I couldn’t lay my eyes off her. In the first 3 days (through text) I was very happy and excited to get to know her. Three days later (which was also when the new school year started and the week of my important sport tournament) I started to have this same tiring coruscating and exhaustive heart clenching feeling as if there is something I am worrying about. It started to increase progressively and I’ve always tried to forget it and keep it in the back of my head but it has been really taking a toll on me as I almost wake up everyday with this feeling and it stays throughout the day. Keeping in mind that throughout this period we’ve grown really close and she seems to really care about me. I have this feeling in the background around 60% of the day 20% is me being distracted by work and friends and the remainder 20% consist of me actually overthinking and worrying. I really don’t understand why is this happening: a. Am I feeling guilty that I am meeting a new person? b. Am I worrying that this new relationship may end like the previous one? c. Am I scarred and no longer can commit to a relationship? d. Why is the same feeling (but less intensity) that I was having before I left my ex happening again???? e. Is the person not compatible for me and I am still seeking my ex? f. Did I still not move on from my previous relationship (prior to the new girl I was certain that I did move on and had 0 feelings but I brought it up now because I have no idea what is the reason for this feeling)Any input can help me understand this feeling that is taking a huge toll on me.

This past year is the first time I've had a very unhealthy relationship with food (had my second child and have been nursing her. I'm a sahm with a 3 and 1 year old). All I can think about is food and eating. I'm constantly ""snacking"" and I'm always eating really bad and unhealthy options. I sometimes get healthier options but something in my brain just won't go for those in the moment and I truly feel I can't control it(I know I can and should be able to but I guess my willpower sucks). I'm so sick of starting and restarting my health journey every day because I can't keep from overeating to an insane level. It's truly becoming embarrassing and I have so much shame.I also have issues with hair pulling. I'll sit and pull my hair out one strand at a time anytime I'm idle. I'm well into it before I even realize how long I've done it. I've had this issue on and off since college. I've spoken about both of these issues with my therapist this past week and all she really told me was to find a sort of ""fidget"" to use when I'm idle to keep from the hair pulling. She gave me no advice on my food issues so I hoping to continue pushing that at the next session.

49344,"[Question] Burned out but boss loves my ability and will continue to incentivize if I do more TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.I was given a rather good yearly review and well incentivized but I am currently stressed and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue but also have me lead more be more of a driver and influencer and upgrade my knowledge cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly and knows how fast I can operate.Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels needed downtime and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing - What if anything do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good.

It was fine at the moment because I was away at college and I had a house near my school. Now that I’m about to graduate and hopefully move back home to save money I have brought up this issue if I could get the room back but instead of hearing me out they had stated that I can just go to the library study. I am not sure whether or not I should just suck it up and move back home or save up enough money to move out officially. Any advice would be wonderful!,Stress

49363,"Is it okay that I did nothing over my month off from university? Hi all thank you for stumbling upon this post. The fall semester ended for me in mid-December and I resume for the spring semester in a week. I'm reflecting on the time I spent while having absolutely no academic social or financial responsibility... to say the very least I'm not very pleased with how I dedicated my time. Much of it was spent sleeping binge-watching shows cooking and staying inside. I did get some important things done but I can't help but think ""why couldn't I have done more?"" I had hoped to do some exploring or go out more frequently to enjoy the outdoors. I'm disappointed in myself for not doing so.At the same time I'm reminding myself that I needed to not do anything for a whole month after a year and a half of consecutive working. This was my first break in a really long time. I'm just upset about how unwisely I spent it... I don't know. Any advice or comments?",Stress

Then last month my laptop was stolen (really scary situation that I’m not gonna into detail about) and I’ve had to email the university using my cell phone instead of my laptop like usual. I realized I’ve been sending draft emails through to the admissions office and associate prof while I was trying to save them and I genuinely just want to cry and give up. It’s such a stupid mistake and given the lack of response on the professor’s part I’m thinking this might ruin my chances.

49370,Yin Yoga is a WONDERFUL Way to Regulate the Nervous System and Manage Stress I am a MA level clinical mental health counselor and was recently certified as a Yin Yoga Therapy Instructor. Though I cannot offer individualized/catered sessions I do provide yin yoga classes on YouTube (@wildheartyogahh) as a free resource to help those who may not be able to afford help in other ways. Many people store emotional energy in the body- specifically in the fascia since 80% of nerve pathways end in the fascia- and yin targets release of fascia and connective tissue through long (3+ min) passive holds. It is a wonderful gentle practice for the mind and body! Hope it can help someone. :),Stress

Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though.

I left home because I didn’t like the environment I was in and being out of state was one of the best options. I don’t have a car and it’s mostly a public transportation type place so it’s not the biggest issue. I don’t ask people for rides unless I really need them. If we go out I’ll tell them we can take the bus. On rare occasions if I need it I’ll ask for a ride. I was getting close to someone and only then did I ask them to take me to target twice once we went the other we didn’t and the second time I really needed to go for a project. So you kinda get the jist of it. When I need to go to and from the airport I has rely on others this is one are I need help in because Ubers are so expensive (also I only need it after and before the winter summer and one thanksgiving break). I generally don’t care too much about it’s safety because I feel it’s generally safe but this one time it’s kind of an issue. I also would like to mention that I don’t really have friends in school. Anyways I ended up contacting many MANY people. They all basically said no. The flight would come in at around 12 AM and none of them could pick me up. I honestly got angry. My thought process was that I’m literally in a bad situation I need a ride and no one can either wake up or cut their plans short? It honestly just made me so frustrated. I get im not your best friend but a girl taking an Uber at 12AM-1AM isn’t okay for many. I’m not the type to go out a lot so it’s uncomfortable for me. I get it’s late at night but it just made me feel like people are selfish. I hope I never treat others the way I feel when I ask others for a ride. Because it feels terrible and I’m not saying these people are the exact reason why I feel this way. I’m sure it’s an accumulation but it just feels so terrible. I hate having to beg and pry and ask. I hate asking for a ride so I do try my best to get there myself. I even offer to pay because I don’t want people to do it for free and then me feel like I’m always bothering them.I don’t know what to do I know I’m emotional about this but people who have cars and give others a ride should try and be more empathetic to those who don’t.",Stress

49418,"Stress Relief in Making Things So last year I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is pour some in the grinder to make sure.Was it expensive? Well getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes mochas I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process satisfaction in these product and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy but friends and family can as well.My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring there's plenty of resources. If you like writing maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food all kinds of classes out there. But all in all make something for you first.",Stress

They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. I am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain dizziness headaches and heart discomfort . The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram several EKGs from the ER visits an MRI 3 months ago no contrast a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability anxiety and maybe clogged artery issues. With the ICP he thought which is phesable I have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head CTs and the MRI showing no pressure(doesn't rule it out) and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and I've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally.
