45395,Hypersexuality I was diagnosed with bipolar unspecified at 13 and I'm a young adult now. I didn't actually find out about my diagnosis until last year because my parents worked really hard to conceal it from me. The most recent discovery has been learning that believe it or not I wasn't just a normal horny teenage boy. I have nearly crippling hypersexuality as a cute little side effect of my bipolar. I don't really want to turn this into a nsfw thread unless it can't be helped but how do you ever cope with this? I'm a severe pornography addict to the point where I can't function if I don't get my daily fix (I have painful shaking fits and the like). It's been like this since I was 11.

45397,"Family question diagnosis - vent Start with the stuff that isn’t as bad.Mom and sister have asked what makes me bipolar. I hide basically everything because nothing good has really came out from opening up. Planning on talking to my sister about it as I trust her more. I beat around the bush (“uhhh... Bipolar symptoms...”). I think they just want to know what’s wrong but I’m anything but comfortable talking about it especially with more than one person.And then there’s my dad!I accidentally told him because I said something about my antidepressants while I was on a high. He asked who told me and I told him a psychiatrist. Didn’t go too much farther. Whatever cool. I asked him a bunch if he was upset because he didn’t look very happy he said he wasn’t.Two days ago he said something like “I’ve never seen you have a mood swing.” Took me off guard really irritated me. You don’t need to see me have a mood swing for me to have them. You don’t need to see me hitting my legs and crying because I feel I’m awful and no one loves me for me to have an actual problem. He’s seen my self harm before do you think that magically goes away? Oh I act fine but that doesn’t mean I am. And he has definitely seen me in my highs. When it’s night and all I do is talk and talk more than normal? Bipolar isn’t necessarily severe mood swings and acting off of them anyways.Then last night he decided to turn it up a notch. I said something that must have riled him up. His response was that I was “making [him] tripolar.”What the fuck???I told him that’s not how it works and it’s not in the DSM and hid in my room.Seriously. What the fuck? Do you not even care how your daughter feels? Do you not even care bipolar is characterized in part with depression that was *obvious* when I was 12-15 and you did *nothing*? Even when I had cuts all over my damn arm? Do you not care that I was in enough pain to go to a psychiatrist? That I have low self esteem that you say upsets you but if I do anything about it suddenly my issues don’t exist?

45400,"Husband has just about blocked me out and refuses to deal with my mental health issues In some ways I can't blame him but I need someone. Right now I have a good friend to talk to but she really just doesn't get it. She never saw the bad years. My husband lived them.I have been married almost 12 years. I know that I've been working hard to act better and my actions have been consistently much more thought out and I've been MUCH less volatile. I can let things go that I would have never been able to before. The other night my really stressed out husband (he went back to college and has just been grumpy the whole time) flew off the handle at me. Over something I said about Mexican Coca-Cola. Anyway I just let him vent as he said things like ""You just make me want to hate you."" And he referred to the last time I was in the hospital as the ""Smlybright show."" - making everything about me. He immediately referred to how selfish I am (which I really haven't been in a long time). This isn't even really him! I least I hope he hasn't turned into this guy!I WAS selfish a long time ago. I was mean a long time ago I was way too hypersexual a long time ago. And he has dealt with all of it. But he can't ever forgive me for anything. He has stopped being there when I really need him because he has just started blocking me out. He doesn't want to deal with me. I cry in private. I contemplate leaving or dying in private. I can't talk to him about these things anymore because ""we've had this conversation 100 times and you never remember what I tell you anyway and I have my own problems to deal with and I know how you feel because I'm depressed and have problems with that and I still am moving forward because somebody has take care of this family (we don't have kids. He means the pets. Which I definitely help with)."" We haven't had sex in about a year. For years prior I felt like he just did it to get his obligatory sex in for the quarter. When we got married we had sex all the time and then I wanted it all the time and he didn't anymore. Then he says he felt like I was using him. Maybe I was. I would actually throw fits about it. Crying screaming fits. Embarrassing but I'm being honest in this post.Medicine has made me gain a lot of weight. He says it's not me. It's that he needs to feel like I am a safe place mentally physically and emotionally. I still wonder if it's just my body. But I take my medicine because it works.He says I get worse every year but when I really look at myself I know I'm doing better in a lot of really important ways. My relationships with other people (not so much my husband right now) have improved tremendously. I am not working anymore (well some part time but not a lot) but I'm slowly becoming more productive and balancing my functionality with my anxiety and the pressure it makes me feel. I bring in the money because I was medically retired from the military.I think sometimes it's how you look at your illness. You can only really judge your own level of the illness affecting your life because you are the only one inside your brain. It's easy to forget the good times when we are feeling low. Last time I had some pretty bad depression I honestly couldn't think of any reason to keep going. I started to end things. But at the critical moment I just had this strong feeling that I was checking out FOREVER. No more good days OR bad days and that I could always off myself if I wanted to so I'd live another day and reevaluate later. And things got better. And then worse and then better. Any advice on any of this would be great. Sometimes I feel like I don't even like him anymore.

We were of the same mind. Good in theory but no real science to support their claims. With MDD and PTST sure but bipolar is a different kind of beast. Anyways I get a call from the doc that runs the cliinic. We talk for about 15 minutes and I get all my questions answered. They claim an 80% success rate. That seem super high for me. Also insurance doesn't cover it so it would all be out of pocket. I am a prime candidate but I'm not going to pay money to be a lab rat especially if there's a 20% failure rate.

45428,"I'm on klonopin but it doesn't seem to be very effective anymore... The background (which can be skipped if you'd like):I've been on benzos for about 16 years. At one point (when I was 20-21) I was put on on Xanax 6mg/day which is obscene. I think this increased my tolerance. At the time I was also very depressed (maybe exasperated by the Xanax) and drinking a liter of vodka a day.Needless to say after a bit of homelessness and finally moving to a different state I was slowly tapered down on Valium. I was relatively stable in that and then was forced to move again to another state where they refused to prescribe any benzos or any adequate medications for my bipolar disorder.I ended up staying in the house for about nine months because I was too anxious to leave. I would go to my psych appointments with no progress on getting them to put me on something that worked for the intense depression I was in. I *was* seeing a psychiatrist at the time who I really connected with and miss him but have never found another one who I don't feel is judging my life.I quit drinking cold turkey 5 years ago and have never had any more problems with that.However I was then forced to move to yet *another* state where I couldn't find any psychiatric treatment whatsoever as was unmediated and in a mixed episode for over a year. I did finally get into psychiatric treatment by going inpatient and was put back on klonopin 3mg/day which I'm told is a high dose.Then my psychiatrist suddenly died and his clinic closed. Two months later I got an appointment with my wonderful new psychiatrist and was back on track. Unfortunately the klonopin doesn't seem to have much effect on me. I've taken 10mg at once with absolutely no effect (I'm aware this is dangerous as fuck but apparently not for me).To the current situation:I am looking for a change. My anxiety level is very high but vaping with nicotine (I have never been an actual cigarette smoker) seems to help quite a bit but not entirely. With the Klonopin not doing its job I feel like a different benzo might be a potential answer. I don't want to be back on Xanax and Valium didn't do much either.

Now that I'm in this emotional state I'm questioning my capability to be a mother in the first place. I babysat my 2 year old nephew yesterday and it took every last drop of my energy. I came home so drained I could barely move. I'm assuming it was also compounded with my current mental fluctuations. But it'll only be more of that if I do have kids. Is it possible to find a balance with kids? Will there be time for myself and time for them? Yes I will be getting back on my meds as soon as possible after the baby comes (if the baby comes) but will it be enough? I'm not even pregnant yet and I feel it might already be too much.

45442,"Wondering If I’m Bipolar... So for as long as I can remember I’ve had issues with mental health. It didn’t get bad until around 12 when I started self-harming and eventually I was hospitalized at 14 after a suicide attempt. There I was put on Zoloft for depression and also diagnosed with anxiety. For a few months I felt happy so I figured it was working. I stopped cutting I felt good. Eventually I just stopped taking it without a doctor’s consent but I took myself off of it slowly. I started cutting again after that. That’s my only experience with doctors/psychologists since and I’m 19 turning 20 in 5 months. I had my first hallucination when I was 16 but the timeline is so bad and foggy because my brain literally can’t remember anything besides the event itself - I was in the shower and just like flicking a switch I thought somebody was in the bathroom with me trying to “get” me. Immediately I opened the curtains to find nothing but still wasn’t convinced. I went to my room thinking something was following me from behind the entire time and closed my door psychotically looking around for whatever was there trying to get me. For about 3 hours I sat in the corner of my room looking back and forth between things that would just escape my direct line of sight - it was like I could only see the “things” trying to get me in the corner of my eye. I wouldn’t move off my bed in fear that it was under my bed and would snatch me that way. It felt so real at the time. I forgot it even happened the next day and didn’t remember it until months later when it randomly popped into my mind but I couldn’t place it along a coherent timeline - only that it had happened sometime that same year. A few months after I remembered the event I was in class and out of nowhere (just like last time) I thought somebody (who in my head looked similar to the girl from the ring/exorcist) was inside the room with me. I started darting my eyes everywhere making sure that she wasn’t - it felt real but apart of me knew it wasn’t but that didn’t help it go away. All throughout the day I continued feeling like she was right behind a closed door or peaking out at me from somewhere. On the bus ride home I was convinced she was somehow following me in vans in cars buildings - this thing that was following me didn’t adhere to the normal rules of transportation she could transport between buildings just to keep an eye on me. It happened about three or four times varying on levels of intensity for about two weeks and that was the last time I’ve had delusions or hallucinations (if that’s even what they are). Now fast forward to 2017 where after smoking weed one night I get put into this semi-catatonic state where I felt unreal like a joke and like where I lived and the people around me were fake too. All kinds of memories of my childhood were playing on fast-forward on my head except I was outside looking at my younger self and it was terrifying I was convinced that I was actually going to die. Now this experience is drug-induced but after this first time I began having experiences like this without being high and the thoughts couldn’t leave my mind - I felt unreal fake all the time and occasionally I wouldn’t be able to view the world around me as real or the people. This happened between July 2017 - December 2017 and it’s just starting to subside after I quit weed a few days ago. But while it was happening it left me in a severe depression. Now since the new year I have been energetic and positive - I feel better about my body (which all throughout my life I have struggled with) and have positive thoughts about it. And not just “I love my body!” its more like “I can 100% fix my body and make it how I want it!” I didn’t sleep for 40 hours straight albeit a 2.5 hour nap before my shift. During work I was talkative (which I NEVER am) and had something to say to about 99% of the customers. It was almost as if when the thought popped in my head no matter what it was I had to say it. Nothing inappropriate mostly just about the products or casual talk or responses but it was so natural. My answers are NEVER natural because I have social anxiety - I’m always rethinking it before I say it. But not this time. I bagged their groceries so fast I couldn’t stop singing songs in my head occasionally singing them out-loud in front of customers and not feeling embarrassed (like casual singing when you have a song stuck in your head except it was a few different songs) When I wasn’t with a customer I couldn’t not be moving my hands my legs etc.Once I got home I became obsessed with watching and rewatching and tweeting about my favorite show. I had so many thoughts about the show and my favorite characters that I just had to put them out there. I think I tweeted about 500-600 times within 6 hours. On top of that I was also writing some characters for a TV show I’m writing and usually I’m a little stunted w/ writing because I’m usually depressed but it was like I could write for ages. I wrote like 10 characters within an hour. This has been going on since the New Year and I’ve gotten a total of... less than 20 hours of sleep within 5 days. And now I just got the idea that I want to finally get my license so I can get a car and runaway. I know logically the plan seems bad but it’s like I have no intention of doing anything else? Like all of my effort is going into that plan. And lastly on top of all this I haven’t eaten one meal since the new year and I don’t feel hungry at all. No desire to eat really albeit a few snacks here and there. I’ve had past experiences with being energetic so I always speculated whether I was bipolar but never like this. 90% of the time I have been depressedSo sorry this was long but please how do I know if this is really bipolar?

45447,"Can you be manic with low self-esteem? (tw suicide) Hey everyoneI just spent a night in a psychiatric assessment unit. Before admitting myself I hadn’t slept in 90 hours not because I couldn’t but because I didn’t feel like I should. I wanted to keep “being productive” which is interesting because I was also too anxious to do things that I actually need to do (reply to emails and texts do work self-care and hygiene). This resulted in three terrible nights of organizing parts of my room drinking cutting exercising writing and beating my Tetris high score. I created more art and wrote more than I ever have in such short period of time. I kept making plans with friends setting goals etc while fully conscious that I would be too emotionally drained to do any of them the next day which just lead to disappointment. The whole time I was awake I was surging with adrenaline and didn’t feel tired. I wasn’t getting hallucinations or feeling sluggish like most people report after not sleeping for 3 days. This was especially strange because I usually feel tired after a normal 8 hours of sleep due to low iron plus I was only eating ~500 cal a day. Instead I felt alert and was able to do math homework write go to work etc. One weird thing was that my train of thought was totally off..one second I would think “I’m getting out of the bath in two minutes” and immediately follow that with “what am I doing in two minutes?” or I’d be surfing reddit see a recommended website open a new tab then forget what I was doing. The second night I was awake I had this really strong urge to kill myself for about two hours (very different from my normal passive “I want to die” thoughts; this was like a primal irrational urge) and I then spent the rest of the day totally out of it like my brain was in a different place. I immediately forgot the details of those two hours after they happened so I can’t even really describe it in detail. This whole not-sleeping episode came right after a few months of feeling extremely depressed unable to perform basic activities or care for myself too anxious to go out or go to classes.Anyways all that to say that I met with a psychiatrist while I was in the unit and she was considering the possibility of bipolar disorder (I am already diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression). Bipolar disorder is not something I have ever considered before. She was worried about putting me back on antidepressants in case it triggered more mania. What held her back was that generally you should feel an inflated self-esteem during manic episodes but I didn’t feel that at all. I hated myself and felt more suicidal than ever before. So my question is: is anyone here bipolar and feels low self-esteem during manic episodes? Is this possible?

It is a hugely complicated process to prepare our body to fight off hostile forces.If inflammation is too low then an infection can get out of hand. If it is too high it causes damage.&gt;&gt;And for some reason about one-third of depressed patients have consistently high levels of inflammation. Hayley is one of them: ""I do have raised inflammation markers I think normal is under 0.7 and mine is 40 it's coming up regularly in blood tests.""&gt;&gt;There is now a patchwork quilt of evidence suggesting inflammation is more than something you simply find in some depressed patients but is actually the cause of their disease.

I enjoyed the time and the depression that followed was usually low-grade as wellgeneral irritability and annoyance of friends feeling like I no longer loved my boyfriend (which in stability I found out I don't)Over that last few months I have finally become stable. Until recently. My medicine has been spotty and once I felt the mania coming I stopped taking it at all.Back on meds but still manic. I love the feeling. It isn't the crazy ""god is speaking to"" staying up all night redesigning a fish tank (why?) or hyper reorganizing that left my house a total disaster as I couldn't have the focus to follow through.It's back to setting goals making lists focusing on healthy and happiness. Low-grade mania actually makes me SAVE moneyI become obsessed with spending as little as I can (whereas the mania from antidepressants had me blow 20k over 4 months)I feel like I'm enjoying living again. Stability is so... so boring. And the problem with stability is that I never learned self-discipline in the face of not having manic inspirations. It isn't depression but my room becomes a complete mess I don't take my dogs on walks I don't try at work. Again that's simply because I am so USED to feeling inspiration and energy from mania that stability requires discipline and vigilance that I have never had to learn.So why should I go back on meds? To me this is worth the depression. I become ultra-functional. Functional enough that I can ride out the depressions as people become used to and aware of my energy and motivation. I understand the mania from before the mania that had me re diagnosed as Bipolar Ithat was purely induced from meds is unsustainable. I didn't even enjoy it. But this is something altogether different. It is ME. I don't know 'stability' that is not me. I don't even dislike it as I'm going through it but now that I'm experiencing the energy again I don't think I can go back. How am I supposed to write poetry paint play the piano clean focus on my healthyhow am I supposed to do that stable when I have no knowledge of self-discipline that makes you drudge through you chores while you're tired and uninspired.I almost feel bad for 'stable' peopleto never experience the inspiration that we have.

Psych doc kept trying to put me back on seroquel even though I told him it makes me freak out he wanted me to try it anyways I did it did nothing but make me panic cry and my heart felt like it would burst (my BPM was 168 thought I was dying). I want to go hide for the rest of my life I want this misery to end. But I'm kinda stuck right now and it's making me panic more out of indecision. My mother is very ill can't walk well and I help her my brother is also mentally sick and I keep him together when he gets nuts. My mom is struggling right now goes to court regarding disability soon so she's nuts and we were talking and I'm saying it's getting very hard for me daily to even live. She said she knows and is very sorry and shed suggest more but she's crazy right now and can't deal with the added stress and I told her OK. But I don't know if I can. I'm so tired of fixing everything else besides myself I feel guilty about needing help feeling suicidal feel like a failure. I want help but I'm scared they won't do anything or flat out ignore me again. I'm very scared and unstable but I feel so fucking guilty if I leave to get help because my family needs me to take care of things they are like little children if I am not around (I am in my mid 20s now) they can't do shit it seems. Sorry I'm frustrated and rambling but at my wits end and could really use some advice. Thanks.",Bipolar
45466,"Don’t know if I have Borderline Personality Disorder or Bipolar? Sorry if my this doesn’t come out properly I feel sometimes as if I have so many Things to say but I don’t know exactly what it is to say. This is mostly a venting. When I was a kid I was diagnosed with Depression. I’ve mostly felt depressed my entire life due to emotional physical and sexual abuse growing up. I was always tired fatigued I could barely get up in the morning and do things as simple as brushing my hair taking a shower eating etc. After I got married whenever my husband and I would get into arguments I would feel so overwhelmed with emotions that I would scream and start to hit him it literally felt like my mind was going to burst and sometimes I would place my hands on my head to keep my thoughts from blowing up. But then when I would blow up I would start screaming and hitting things without any discernible purpose. We just thought I was just an overly emotional person because we never assumed anything was wrong other than my depression. So we went through several years of that until a few years ago I had an emotional affair with someone that literally seemed it came out of NOWHERE. At that time We started going to a doctor for depression where he also diagnosed me with bipolar depression(?) and anxiety. and then prescribed me vibryyd then lamictol trileptol Zoloft Gabpentin (sorry for the spelling) and then finally Wellbutrin. (Not all at the same time just in a period of a year) I also went to a therapist who told me to pretty much divorce my husband and at that time I felt like that was the greatest thing to do so I went through with it up until the paperwork and then suddenly decided I didn’t want to go through with it. Around that time I also stopped my affair extremely abruptly; it felt like I literally woke up one day and didn’t want anything to do with that person and situation. Throughout all this time I’ve had about 15 jobs either quitting or being fired. I would be really happy for months I would be excellent at my job then suddenly I felt like doing nothing I would lose complete interest and that showed in my quality of work. There was also a point where I drank heavily when I had the affair to the point where I would be drunk everyday. That feeling to get drunk did go away just as quickly as the feeling to have the affair did as well. Thankfully my husband and I got through it all he forgave me and I’ve been extremely consistent with my medicine and trying to make things as easy as possible for my mental health. My doctor at that time prescribed me Xanax for my anxiety with did not help AT ALL. It made me feel like hell. If I took it and didn’t fall asleep immediately after my body and bones would feel like they were shaking and my mind felt like everything was sped up even more. This caused me to jump in front of oncoming traffic to kill myself because the pain was just so bad. I wasn’t harmed thankfully but I did get baker acted until I weaned my self off the Xanax which was an incredibly low dose if I remember correctly. I also put on 20 pound during this time which worsened my depression. After all this my doctor took me off Xanax and lamictol and just kept me on a new medicine Wellbutrin CL (300mg) I felt GREAT. I suddenly had all the energy in the world and was able to get up and do things! I did have some depressive days but they went away fairly quickly. I was really happy I thought I found the medicine for me! But it stopped working I got more depressed and at the same time I found myself getting More and more irritable my emotions blew up again I couldn’t have arguments without screaming in a rage and hitting myself or my husband and my anxiety was getting worse to the point of being angry and irritated all the time. Instead of going back to the doctor we found a new one and he pretty much told me that my old doctor was just treating my depression while my bipolar disorder was not in check. So he decreased my Wellbutrin to 150mg and gave me back my lamictol and added 25mg of seroquel as a sleep aid. I’m happy that this doctor is really trying to fix what the last doctor messed up but my concern now is that what if I just have Borderline personality disorder instead? Someone told me that those people have REALLY intense emotions which is what I feel now but I don’t want to diagnose myself when the doctor already told me I have bipolar disorder. I just have a lot of distrust if that makes sense. Also this seroquel makes me so drowsy I sleep 12+ hours and all day I feel this grogginess like a zombie almost and I’ve only been at 50 mg- 25mg. I feel calm and relaxed but it feels like my body is so slow. So I’m just worried that this medicine isn’t really for me and just another med that will make me lose my mind. I just don’t know what to feel or if I’m bipolar or just depressed and all this makes my head spin and Feel even more hopeless. ",Bipolar

It's been tough) I do not have health insurance at the moment although I should have it within a few months. The timing could not be worse and I'm trying.. so.. hard to remain positive. Despite having the worst depression of my life I've managed to stay interested in the things I enjoy. Recently I've grown more and more uninterested and numb. Today I don't feel like doing anything. I stayed in bed all day I barely ate and haven't had any water. I barely want to move. I'm thinking about suicide every chance I get and breathing feels like a chore. I don't know what I'm trying to get out of posting I just needed to tell someone. I need to go to a hospital or something but I can not. This is the worst feeling ever. Knowing you need help but can't receive any and being completely alone on top of that. Honestly my cats are keeping me going at this point.

I showered nice and hot (I'm a girl so the fires of hell would be comfortable lol) then laid down and listens to my playlist.

Hey all posting under alt throwaway for reasons.I recently had a pdoc retire which meant dealing with the lovely process of finding a new one. It took months and was all around bad. So I finally started seeing this new doc and things are looking better...Except last week I started getting some side effects from a meds tweak we had agreed on. I wanted to register my experiences with the doctor before they got lost to my utterly fractured memory.Let me note that over the past decade-plus I have worked with six other pdocs and every single one of them offered two direct contact channels *at least* - a private voicemail box and a private email. They have all been clear that answers were not guaranteed let alone timely and emergencies always go to 911. Most had a list of on-call staff you could talk to within minutes.Biggest thing for me is the privacy. Legal implications aside **I don't want ANYONE reading/listening to the stuff I disclose to my pdoc.**So here's the kicker. New doc gave me his contact card at initial appointment; so far so good. Dumbass me loses the card. Call receptionist to ask doctor to get in touch either via email or phone.I was told that the receptionist is the ""best"" person to email and straight up didn't get an answer to the phone question. Not even a ""we can have the doctor call you when they get a chance.""On top of this a ton of people are telling me this is MY broken expectations and doctors never give out contact info.I am so confused frustrated angry and generally miserable about this...

45481,"finally got up the courage to go to the Psychiatrist. I'd been hesitant.. scared.. wary.. about going before. Thoughts racing through my head of what a diagnosis would mean for me. My pdoc didn't feel comfortable giving me a diagnosis for anything other than general anxiety/depression and recommended I go to a specialist so I could get more accurate treatment. Took me well over a year to finally go. I'd made appointments and blew them off never actually going. I'm so glad I did now.I had to get over the fact that I would get diagnosed with 'something' and it would be on my medical records. I guess I had some preconceived notion that it would never go away and there would be some sort of stigma attached to me everywhere I go. Irrational as that may sound it is what prevented me from seeking professional help.I finally went this past Monday spent an hour with a P.A. talking about my history what meds I am currently on (Lexapro/Wellbutrin from my pdoc) etc. She took that information and talked to one of their head Psychiatrists about it then came back about 15 minutes later with him. He was very nice understanding and seemed genuinely interested and concerned about my care. My personal research proved to be right. I have Bipolar II. I felt an inner sense of calmness and clarity now that I had a professional someone that has spent their life studying conditions such as this verifying that yes indeed there was something amiss in my brain. And that better help was coming.Lexapro had been working WONDERS for my anxiety and slightly for depression as well. Wellbutrin didn't seem to do much but made life ""liveable"". I was not thriving or excited about anything. Just going through the motions.He took me off Wellbutrin and replaced it with a mood stabilizer Trileptal. I stopped the Wellbutrin cold turkey and started Trileptal that same night. I had a really good Tuesday and today is looking great as well. I feel much better now that I was finally able to get over myself and get proper help and hopefully better meds to balance my moods. I have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. By then I hope to see even more positive changes with the Trileptal.I also chose to stop drinking cold turkey as well. I knew I had been drinking too much for too long. Each time I drank it was 6+ beers and sometimes 4-5 nights a week. It became routine. A way to quell my mind at the end of the night. To slow the racing thoughts. It took the words from the Psychiatrist to really cement it in my brain that alcohol counteracts anti depressants and that in order to feel better I would need to make a lifestyle change. He said the Trileptal would assist in those nighttime racing thoughts.I even stopped smoking cannabis. This happened after I started the Wellbutrin. I think that can be attributed to the fact that Wellbutrin is somewhat of a cessation tool used for people quitting cigarettes. The urge or desire to smoke (which used to be daily) just stopped. I don't care anymore. It doesn't really do anything for me. Even with my MMJ card and specific strains all it really did was numb me and slow my brain down (again like with Alcohol to slow the racing thoughts). So without the alcohol and cannabis I feel strongly that I can finally let my mind be a blank slate for the psych meds to work properly and not be counteracted or made less effective by other psychoactive chemicals.I am committed to feeling better and if drinking La Croix instead of beer helps in any way I'm all for it. I want to be able to let the meds do their job in the most effective manner.Thanks for being here community.

I thought I could put it as far away from my bed as possible and not have it affect me but it was still too bright. Throwing up meds + ? days of unrestful sleep due to too much light from the charger = waking up at 4am and completing 5 of my Chinese lessons restlessly pacing the house for an hour straight and then doing 200 crunches nonstop. Mind you I am someone who barely exercises so this was pretty out of character for me!

I don't see suicide as an option however I'm getting desperate.I'm seeing a psychiatrist for the first time soon but I'm afraid it won't be enough. My family situation also isn't the healthiest but I feel really helpless on my own. Also have adhd and anxiety to the extent that nearly everything overwhelms me. I'm very childish and couldn't imagine handling the responsibilities of living alone. Is anyone else as pathetic as me? I have no friends no dreams no desires no motivation no stability inside my mind (or outside of it). I need to bond with someone desperately but who would ever want such an empty person? Yet I'll probably run off and do something impulsive in my desperation to not feel.... this.",Bipolar

I spent nearly 10 minutes to no avail trying to throw them up bc I have shit to do today and nothing came up. I guess bc there’s nothing really in my stomach?? My tongue and lips- basically whole mouth is kind of numb. Mannn I had shit to do today. I took my AM meds (that include adderall) after puking failed and now that I’m typing this..

45497,"The fog has lifted but I can't tell if it's stability or hypomania After my meds stopped working about a month ago I returned to another awful mixed episode. It was my first period of stability since I first had symptoms two years ago and I've been so afraid of how long before it would come back. How long I would be useless and unable to function in mixed state hell. I had some med changes last week but I thought I would never be stable again. But this afternoon something changed. It's like my eyes opened wider my senses were heightened my energy levels quadrupled and I now desire to do things. I finally took that shower I couldn't take all week. I was joking around with my family all day and having deep laughs that actually hurt. It felt oh so genuine too. It's not all better my paranoia's still there and I was a bit delusional today. Feel a little antsy. My flashbacks of my mania have continued at about the same intensity as well. The thing is the first time I was stable it felt a lot more subtle and not as sudden. It was great since it was the first time I had felt like a person in so long but this is something else. I feel so disconnected to how I felt just yesterday it's like it never happened. Like I've been feeling this good forever and I just woke up from a bad dream. The recent med change was increasing my lithium from 900mg@0.6 level to 1200mg@0.9 level. When I was first put on Lithium at only 300mg I had the same high I'm experiencing now is that typical? Also added on 50mg seroquel but can a dose that low really do anything yet? It might seem overwhelmingly obvious that I'm hypomanic right now but idk. For one I haven't been hypomanic in so long recently it's either been manic or mixed manic. Also I feel more in control compared to when I was last hypomanic. More self-aware and hopefully less annoying. Then again maybe that's because I have more experience with this hell now.

45498,"I can't decide about school... The second semester just started and idk what to do... I haven't been to school since before Christmas and right now my goals are to take a shower every week and get through the day. I was gone for some time last semester as well and will probably not get a grade in a few classes. This week I met with my school counselor main teacher and my ""psychologist"" about school. I'm currently being evaluated for bipolar but it seems pretty clear that I'm going to be put on some medication at least which is kind of terrifying. Though it will be some time until then. So my options are to either take the rest of the school year off and start this autumn redoing my school year or take 3 classes now and the rest next year. Everyone excepts me to have an answer but I don't. I can't even answer simple questions like ""What do you want to eat?"". I wish somebody would just tell me even though I know I have to decide myself. I just can't seem to care. I could barely speak and focus throughout the meeting and my mom ended up speaking mostly. The psychologist brought up shortly how I was last time we talked and I felt shameful for how I had acted. I talked with my brother about how things have been lately and he could kind of relate to my ""ups"" only it's from his experiences with drugs. I didn't think it was that bad and it seems he thought he was experiencing a milder version of what I was experiencing. That hit me. Right now it's like I'm taking a look into myself looking at things that seem new to me and all of this is overwhelming and having to evaluate myself is freaky. Idk if school thrown into the mix will help and now my whole class knows I struggle mentally (in Norway we have a main class that take certain subjects together). I've also been oversharing with some people and I feel like everyone is looking at me differently. I feel like a disease and a pushover. I'm making everything worse and being distant to everyone but I can't help it. Mom deserves better than me. Though it would maybe be better to take 3 classes now instead of everything next year. The thing is that I haven't been able to concentrate at all. Up or down. When I was up there was just too much noise in my head and I had too many other plans. I couldn't even concentrate on what I wanted to do and kept jumping between a lot of things. Still I was 100% sure I could catch up to everything in a couple days which didn't happen. I ended up not sleeping making a workout schedule that was ridiculous especially for someone who doesn't excercise drinking a lot of Bailey's to calm down (didn't work) even though I rarely drink then jogging and working out. Then turning really suicidal and lashing out for 2-3 days before becoming numb. I hate that I want to live yet die so badly at the same time. But. This wasn't what I was going to talk about.

45499,"Insights from over two years of custom mood tracking (SO MUCH DATA) **Some background statistics are needed to understand these interpretations and I'll do the most basic explanation I can to make it most accessible (while risking misrepresenting it; if you want to get pedantic and explain it better in the comments go ahead). The explanations are in the footnotes below.*** my mood over the past two years has improved slightly but overall stayed about the same. an average mood of 64.76 for 2016 and 64.91 for 2017 that's something.* 576 days out of 741 (~77%) of days felt more good than bad.* I spent 92 days in the last two years with a mood lower than 40% (~12% of the 741 days)* I spent 15 days severely depressed (~2%)* I spent 8 days with strong suicidal feelings and 3 days actively pursuing suicide* I spent 159 days with a mood above 80%. 57 were in 2017 99 were in 2016 and the remainder were in either 2015 or 2018 for which few days have been recorded.* I spent 24 days euphoric (mood 90+%)* I spent 8 days on top of the world euphoric (mood&gt;92%)* my mood had a standard deviation of 18.86 percentage points for 2016 and 15.60 percentage points for 2017 I've gotten more stable. A full time job does that I guess. So does no longer having the tribulations of terminal cancer in your life.* my happiest days of the last two years were all in 2016 (lower standard deviation suggested as much) (an emphatic thank you to the redditor behind 8/14/16 being one of them)* my custom manic rating scale suggests I spent 34 days in 2017 some kind of manic (~9.3%) and 51 days in 2016 some kind of manic (~14%)* Getting off lowers my stress levels and increases my mood: each orgasm reduces my perceived stress by 3 percentage points. with a p value of under .001. With mean stress levels of 35.7% that's about an 8.4% difference per orgasm. Each orgasm also raises my mood by about 3 percentage points for a typical increase of ~4.7% per orgasm.* each 1 (out of 10) point increase in my stress levels increases my anxiety on average by 4 percentage points. With mean anxiety levels of 28% that's a 14% difference per point.* the effects of alcohol on my mood are unclear. My mood tracker strongly suggests (P&lt;.001) I drink more when I feel good but the direction of causality here is likely such that I drink because I feel good rather than because it makes me feel good. The data isn't of a nature that can tell me how it affects me during the duration of alcohol. It's clear there isn't sufficient evidence to strongly support the hypothesis that alcohol makes me in particular depressed.* sleep plays a highly significant role in minimizing stress and anxiety with p values of .01 and .03 respectively and meaningful correlation coefficients.* weed improves my mood by .624 percentage points per level of r/trees high-ness scale. with a p value of .019 and a mean mood of 64.84 that's about a 1% improvement per point of highness. At a total high that's a 10% increase in mood (and a very high likelihood of experiencing some psychosis). At a moderate high that might be a 5% increase in mood. In other words weed definitely improves my mood overall but at level other factors are still very important. ***It's worth noting that the percentage increase in mood is different based on the baseline mood if I'm at a suicidal depression (typical such mood around 15% (1 is most suicidal ever on my scale)) a 10 point increase in mood is actually an increase in mood of ~67%)***. I actually used weed the last time I was suicidal to get out of those feelings and it helped me. Weed is risky and makes some of us psychotic and can make us depressed. Use it with caution if at all.* weed increases my sleep. with an average night's sleep lasting 7.96 hours and an increase of .045 hours per point of the r/trees high-ness scale for a very strong high increasing my hours slept by a half hour (this is probably weaker than it should be because of an alarm)* weed impairs my cognition. p value &lt;.002* weed causes me psychosis with a p value of less than .001. Typically the psychosis hasn't been severe so it's something I've continued. It's not helping me but that's why they call it a vice.* I drank a bit more in 2017 than 2016 thanks to a bender around July where I learned to cope with boredom better (1.24 drinks per day vs 1.1 drinks per day) but I've had two drinks in 2018 for an average of .18 drinks per day. I intend to drink again but I'm giving my liver a break for the time being.P value is most basically explained as the likelihood of occurring due to chance with 1 meaning 100% and 0 meaning couldn't randomly occur at all (I know this isn't quite right but this is a simplification). R squared is how well an algorithm explains the data. a high r squared means a regression has high explanatory power. 1 is a perfect fit 0 is no fit. Beta is the strength of a correlation. If my mood is measured on a 100 point scale and one unit of sleep changes my mood by +6 points then sleep would have a beta of 6. Standard deviation is a descriptor for the amount of variation in a data set. If everything is close to average it's got a low standard deviation. If everything is very disparate it will have a high SD.-Edit: thought I had percent and percentage point confused somewhere but was wrong so I fixed it twice oops.Edit 2: I wanted to share it but was feeling too worn out to set up a new one for you guys but u/glitter-beast reminded me [I posted about it before and had a dropbox saved file for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/6mmchn/making_a_mood_tracker_how_i_did_it_why_you_might/). I updated the one I linked in the description there to make it more likely to output possible mania (as it seemed to fail at this) corrected an error that was getting in the way of accurate alcohol-related depression results and changed the dates to be for 2018Edit 3: the biggest thing I might change for yourself if I was you would be the role of your sex drive in your manic rating.

45501,"New to Risperdal; do side effects subside? I'm 27 years old and was just diagnosed with bipolar type II after Prozac treating what they thought was depression sent me into a psychotic episode. I was diagnosed with major depression &amp; generalized anxiety disorder at 12 years old and just coasted on Wellbutrin XL &amp; Celexa until college then cut back to just Wellbutrin XL in college until about a month ago. I haven't been depressed in at least a year but my anxiety has been out of control for many years. The psychiatrist at the hospital was convinced the anxiety is a manifestation of hypomania and put me in Risperdal 0.5mg twice a day. I started it 4 days ago and take it in additional to Wellbutrin.Anyway enough about that. My dose of Risperdal is very low at 1mg a day and I still feel like a [metaphorical] zombie. My brain is in a fog and I can barely stay awake. I'm terrified of driving or working like this. No general anxiety though! Thankfully I don't notice an increase in appetite either.If you took Risperdal did early symptoms go away after a while? I'm just a little disturbed because it's such a low dose and I'm already feeling like this. The psychiatrist eventually wants to maybe bump me up to 2mg a day but if that's gonna make me feel even more like this I don't know if I'd be able to function.

I'm not a person who likes or enjoys social media (I'm an old fart) so please understand I'm only borrowing her account for this. Thank you. I hope someone can help me out with something I need to know. When my ex (daughters mom) is dealing with a common cold or flu she tends to go into almost a bipolar mania with borderline psychotic actions. She lashes out verbally and sadly physically. Last time a week ago she physically went after our 10 year old daughter. I had to drive to her house after my daughter called me terrified locked in the bathroom as her mother was kicking at the door. I have my daughter now getting her therapy and have a 3 year no contact order for my daughter and I against her mother. So when my ex gets sick with normal winter illnesses why does she spiral downward like this.? Then she blames anyone and everyone that it was there fault. My daughter was asked if she could go and get her mother a glass of water and my daughter said ok but could you please wait a few minutes so I can finish up my last bit of homework. Normally anyone would be ok thank you but not my ex. She started breaking things and basically telling our daughter that she doesn't care about mom and doesn't care about mom being sick and then into saying what did I ever do to you to make you hate me just a glass of water and you couldn't even be responsible and respectful enough to go get it. Now my daughter is not a child that yells back or gets defiant (yet lol she's at least 2 years away from the hormones) and my daughter is very soft spoken and would help anyone who asked. Complete opposite of my ex thank the heavens. Plus my ex goes off and on meds for the last 14 years. She says she doesn't have a problem and if she did meds cure it and ya da all gone. Please help me understand the correlation between bipolar and colds/flus with a person who cycles back and forth and refuses meds then goes back on for roughly a month no more than that every few years. Thank you Update edit: For the record I don't plan on keeping the PFA order no contact for 3 years. That's what the judge ruled. I just wanted it for 3 months but with supervised visits for a few weeks leading into an actual custody order for my ex to have our daughter 50/50. But because ex was arrested (swinging at a cop and it was neighbors who called unbeknownst to me until the next day) the judge ruled this way. Yes I wanted to just get her out of my daughters life because I was extremely angry for a few years. It was for me. Not my daughter. It was so I could feel better. Thanks to my wife she's changed my view on how it shouldn't be a selfish want or desire. I had to think about my daughter AND my ex and how it wouldn't be a good thing for either of them if I stopped their relationship. So I apologize to everyone on here for being a jerk.

45509,"Well I’m bipolar. Hey folks. After a very shitty year where I lost our house to foreclosure our savings and nearly did in my loving family (wife and two daughters 13 and 10) I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar. The psychiatrist has me on a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant for now which seem to be helping. They’re still making a full assessment so we’ve got a ways to go as yet. My wife has been amazing — despite the shock of the foreclosure and all the monetary problems she’s stayed with me and helped me find well recommended doctors and therapists for help. We’ve been going through couples counseling as well to help us get on the same page — the couples counselor suggested I might be bipolar which started us working through the diagnosis process and into treatment. My kids haven’t been told of the diagnosis yet and we’re not sure if or when we will tell them or how. Personally I’m a little freaked out. I’ve already been diagnosed as ADD which seems to also be correct but that seems a lesser issue since I am able to hyper focus and accomplish a lot. Or maybe that was a combination of hyper focus and manic episodes. I’m having trouble coming to terms with who’s right now. It’s been a hard blow and has fractured my self image. I’ve always considered myself in control of my mind and actions and now I really don’t know what I’m in control of any more. It’s been surreal and I’ve been feeling a little lost.

45512,"Just Some Thoughts I was on risperdal up until last year right before exams ended my senior year. I ended it in April due to lactating. I was on 4mg and it helped in every aspect. I did hate being tired the constant headaches heart flutters high blood pressure and gaining weight. It helped with my paranoia so much. It helped with my anxiety a lot.I switched to Abilify but I couldn't afford it on insurance so I switched to lithium. I haven't seen my doctor since I quit my restaurant job and have become a stripper. I'm on lithium but my paranoia wasn't going away so I took a 2mg risperdal last night. I can't sleep when I miss a dose of lithium. I had missed 2 doses and I can't swallow the pills because they are too big for me. I usually break them and put them in yogurt which makes it bearable. Has a metallic taste but it's okay. Better than swallowing a whole pill. The scary thing is I can't tell if I'm going manic anymore because since I was in the hospital at 16 I don't get that high manic I was. I don't even talk fast like I used to. It's more of being highly emotionally unstable. It's more where my thoughts feel like dough in a mixer moving really fast and I can't control the settings. I did a mindful meditation video and that helped a lot. I'm fine right now calm but damn I hate paranoid thoughts. I hate thinking ""He's only talking to me so he can get dirt on me. He doesn't like me as a person he's faking it so he can make me lose my job."" There's so much stress I have and I don't have ativan nor do I want any because I'm trying to rely less on anxiety medications. I haven't had ativan in a few weeks I found one and took it back then but it's been over a month since I ran out of my script. Money has also been tight and I haven't been able to afford food up until last weekend I was living off of noodles potatoes and oatmeal so I didn't want to take my lithium. My job is tricky because when I stay up late I HAVE HAVE to take the next day off because if I keep messing up my sleep cycle I'm super unstable. I will get aggravated at small things. I will get emotional and overthink. That's basically it when I'm off my meds. I don't really get all that delusional but maybe I do? For example when I'm smoking a cigarette I have to pick up a specific one because if I don't pick that specific one then things will be bad. Or if I don't hold something a certain way things will go bad or so i think. I keep overthinking things. I'm paranoid that everyone around me that tries to talk to me doesn't really care for me unless I already know them. For example at work if someone tries to talk to me I don't trust them which is standard in my line of work don't trust anyone. I don't like people talking to me and it's weird because I'll be having a bipolar episode or so it feels when I miss meds but I'm sleepy I'm so so sleepy but if I stay up past 12 all hell breaks loose. I can't sleep my whole schedule is messed up. I have to sleep before 12 to keep myself normal which is hard with my line of work.I know I should find a new job but then again paranoia and fear of rejection. More fear of rejection than anything. Living in fear from high school and the bullying. How people were mean and I just relive high school when I see them but that's a battle of confidence i need to work on myself.",Bipolar
45513,"Do you have phases? I do. I've noticed a structure and pattern of my phases as it relates to my level of brain activity from depression to hypomania. I hope sharing this will clarify these cycles for others. I have a lot of phases of interest. Sometimes they reoccur sometimes they're one-offs. It's frustrating to be passionate about something and then stop. But I know it's because my moods change.I've come to some observations about my phases and even have a little theory about them although it may just be limited to my case. Here's the theory:My phases fall into four categories. At the lowest level there is basic pleasures. Some basic pleasures I've had are baseball harry potter and Disney movies. Next there is high pleasure: e.g. classical music jazz music and Shakespeare. Then I have phases of personal development: losing weight learning musical skills learning Spanish. Finally I have the highest order of phases where I have a sense of duty: I've become vegan and buddhist out of this level.I feel like these phases accord to a particular level of brain activity from low to high. I think everyone falls somewhere on this dimension at a given moment. I also think healthy people have a smaller average range of categories of particular interest: some people skew basic to high some high to personal development some just are adept at acting on a sense of duty.At least in my case I run the full gamut. At a depressed level I have basic interests (at a certain level of depression one my have NO interest but I don't get that low). At a hypomanic level I have a grandiose sense of duty. However I feel like I have a natural balance. I feel like I have an ideal scope like anyone else but I have no balance of brain activity. I feel at my ""most me"" when I am at a mix of high pleasure and personal development.I've also noticed a pattern of logical progression from disordered to ordered interest in my life. Say I start at my healthy level: high–deveopment. When I approach a sense of runaway personal development I become grandiose about that development. Then I may achieve a personal sense of duty to apply that development. Of course my deveopment only goes so far and my sense of duty goes farther so I burn out. Then in a depressed mode I land in basic pleasure. With higher mood after building basic pleasures I ""grade them up"" to high pleasures from which point I have more confidence in my ability to develop related skills. The cycle restarts.This is very interesting to me but all I've really done is describe a pattern of disordered mood change in terms of its effects on human interest and concern and apply conceptions of general human interests and concern in doing so.But I actually think I have a lifestyle tip for myself based on this theory. I'm at the high level of the personal development stage right now and could approach an abnormal sense of duty. First of all by recognizing this generalized progression I can catch any slip ups early and so can my support circle. But what really interests me is how I can adjust my personal development habits toward a more healthy progression.Right now my personal development topic is math. Math is an extremely broad topic in terms of range of difficulty and scope. I could get frustrated with basic algebra or I could obsess over an unsolved problem way out of my league. But I think about another personal development habit I had: weight loss.When I lost weight it was a development of daily regiment one where I ate a little less every day and gradually lost weight. Normally I have a seasonal peak of hypomania where I have that grandiose duty. After the regimented challenge of losing weight became difficult I went to a modestly fairly euthymic basic pleasure. The nature of the challenge didn't involve runaway progress because of how structured it was.Applying that lesson to my math development I could continue to over stress myself with difficult problems or I could make it a daily grind. I could even get a tutor to make sure I stay on a good track. Perhaps I wouldn't have to go to a toxic level of stimulation and go hypomanic and just cool off adding a daily practice to my life.Thinking this way has opened up some different options about how to deal with my moods as well as who I really am. I see my doctor tomorrow and I look forward to discussing these ideas with him.-Note about ""high"" and ""low"" pleasures: I didn't mean to call anyone's hobby ""high"" or ""low"". I think it's completely relative. I think something high for me could be low for someone else. I strongly believe whether a pleasure is high or low at least in a mental health context depends on the kind of enjoyment one gets out of it. It's something one can really know if one really asks themselves and is honest.",Bipolar

And right now I’m feeling depressed after an episode of non stop energy and I know it’s going to take a while for me to come out of this spell. Anyone have any tips. I was seeing a therapist but stopped going when after I was leveled for a while. I’m on medication as well. Although I’m on medication I went through a manic phase of high energy through the month of December. I didn’t really notice. I’m bad at spotting my moods.

45518,"[Rant] I KNEW IT! My medication is poisoning me! I originally posted this over in the /r/CasualConversation Weekly Chat Thread but upon reflection realized it would be much better suited to this sub as it's pretty specific towards my disorder and I feel I'd get better advice here from people who are knowledgable of what I've been dealing with. From my original post:&gt;It'll be 8 years this summer since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and got put on a treatment consisting of Depakote/Epilum (sodium valporate) for rapid cycling moods and mania. Over the years I've constantly inquired about what sort of side effects I would experience on this drug and every single time my doctors have been frustratingly vague and flippant never sitting down and going through the effects in a thorough and detailed manner.&gt;As a result I've had to do my own research and recently I uncovered several side effects that NO ONE told me about:&gt;According to what I've read in numerous articles and medical journals prolonged/long term usage of sodium valporate can apparently CAUSE depressive episodes and according to the many medical journals I've perused it is not as effective against treating depressive bipolar episodes in the long run. Considering that I've been dealing with crippling bouts of depression over the last 7 years this makes sense but no-one told me. NO ONE TOLD ME.&gt;It can cause pancreatic damage and liver problems on it's own. My pyschiatric doctor (the one who typically prescribes me this shit on a 3 monthly basis) has been constantly drilling it into me that all the times I've gotten elevated liver enzyme readings from my 6-8 weekly blood tests has been because I drank alcohol whilst taking this fucking medication. Not once has she ever stopped to inform me that this stuff causes liver problems all by itself regardless of whether you drink or not let alone any mention of trouble involving the pancreas which is typically characterized by intense cramping/pain in the abdomen due to organ damage and inflammation of the pancreas. This makes SO MUCH SENSE considering that all these years I've had near-daily cramping and aches in my abdomen that I always previously thought was due to IBS or my IUD being a dick.&gt;Apparently it can increase the likelihood of polycystic ovary syndrome and something called hyperandrogenism which I have never heard of before now but is a condition to do with having too many androgens or male hormones/testosterone in the body along with uterine fibroids which also explains the agonizing cramps I often get regardless of what time of the month it is. Also I was at child-bearing age (22) when they first started me on sodium valporate and whilst I have no desire to ever procreate the fact of the matter is that all these conditions lead to infertility so I feel incredibly deceived by the doctors who put me on this shit because again NO-ONE TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.&gt;I am absolutely steaming and yet I just know that if/when I raise these issues with my current psych doctor she will no doubt laugh off my concerns like she always fucking does and dismiss my worries as trivial.&gt;I know it's dangerous to quit cold turkey but I honestly feel so betrayed right now considering all that I've learned. I ended up writing a strongly worded but teeth-grittingly ""polite"" letter outlining all these concerns so I can slap her in the face with it- not literally but y'know- and get my voice heard.&gt;I want to change my doctor and try to get one who will help me find an alternative course of treatment but giving that all this happened on public healthcare (which is often laughably crap at times here) it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being a long drawn out process.&gt;Urgh.

For those that just want a brief summary""**TL;DR the Peace Corps rejected me because I admitted to having bipolar not thinking anything of it because I am high functioning and my doctor can clear me. I decided to fight this to the bitter end since I am not my mental illness and they can't reject me based on their discriminatory and outright archaic assumptions about the condition**I am a 23 year old college student that will graduate this spring with degrees in Biology and French. Three years back I was diagnosed BP II and as most of you know it was a wild ride. By communicating with my psychiatrist and by making the right lifestyle choices I have remained totally asymptomatic for more than a year.Being young and hoping to join Doctor's Without Borders someday I decided I would join the Peace Corps to gain the necessary public health program experience and to expand my French (I'm looking at West Africa). I spent a large amount of time working on my resume and statement and kept in touch with my local Peace Corps recruiter. He gave me advice and assured me that I was a shoe-in for a position in Benin because of my health care experience and language experience (I work as a full-time Rec Therapist while finishing classes full time. Not easy but incorporating the right lifestyle choices has helped my time management).After I turned in my application I was informed that I would have to fill out a Health History form divulging any medical conditions that I had. Naturally I was honest - my doctor said he'd provide a letter clearing me medically and my recruiter already said verbatim that I am ""extremely qualified""What happened next blew me away. An automated email was sent to me after I turned in the Health History form informing me that my ""condition"" could not be supported in the country I chose. *Not one person from the organization would speak to me further about the issue*. I've been told dozens of times about how they're sorry but they simply don't make those decisions. What's really shocked me is that *my resume and essay we're not even looked at because of admitting the condition*.I have been hiding my mental health ever since my diagnosis. It has not affected my professional life or my work. I am high functioning and need no more ""accommodation"" than a ""healthy"" volunteer (whatever that is). Having them reject me for checking the ""wrong"" box made me incredibly angry and hurt. But instead of accepting this I've been fighting it for the past 2 months. I've called senators lawyers mental health advocacy groups and have begun the informal resolution process with their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. When they asked what I hoped to get out of this process I told them that I want to be medically cleared and that I want them to put an end to this discriminatory process. Odds are they will not give me an inch so I am prepared to take this to District Court (there was a case in 1996 where a volunteer was rejected because she admitted to taking antidepressants. The court ruled in her favor and this decision gives me hope).The most exciting development will come the end of this month. Patrick J. Kennedy nephew of John F. Kennedy (who coincidentally founded the Peace Corps) will be coming to my city to advocate for mental health rights. Patrick Kennedy was diagnosed with bipolar himself so I'm doing everything in my power to go to the conference and talk to him get him a letter anything - if there's an offhand chance to get him to lobby the PC on my behalf I need to take it.I'm not giving up this fight until I receive my letter of acceptance or until they tell me ""stop calling us or we will contact the police"". I will let you guys know the newest updates as they come up - if you have any ideas for me on how to fight this archaic government process please throw your ideas here.As always never give up trying new things to get your condition under control.

The idea was that if I did something I loved that mentally/creatively stimulated me then I would be prone to having fewer episodes and just be in a better place overall.This proved to mostly work. I was able to be creative to a point but I was still restricted by someone else's parameters. This new job would offer me the chance to build something from the ground up.

Emotional (Mood) symptom wise last year was not as intense as I've experienced before. But last year was indeed the shittiest fucking year I have lived through in my entire life thus far. I won't list everything that was shitty. You guys know last year was horrible. My Mom almost dying before her liver transplant probably topped my list though. And my bipolar mania has decided to manifest entirely through my secondary symptoms of OCD. Chronic anxiety has taken over my usual depression and has crash landed directly on one main symptom. [Self Excoriation/dermatillomania/compulsive skin picking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excoriation_disorder) No exaggeration I look like the picture in that Wikipedia link just add breasts and some curves. I'm not looking for advice or guidance. I've been receiving the professional version steadily over a year and a half now. I just know that CSP is not common in this sub is often not associated with bipolar and is still considered co morbid along with symptoms of OCD.**The point of my post.:** I saw my psychiatrist today. And he agreed that I have had very significant improvements since I last saw him. My episodes have been less frequent less intense and my depression has also eased up. My mania still keeps me awake throughout the week (I get 3-4 hrs sleep at a time around 4-7am.) and I literally sleep all weekend. But my job hasn't been suffering I've made three trips from the west coast to Texas for some extremely intense circumstances I've lost 30lbs and reduced my ""skin picking"" from my legs and lower arms to just my upper arms back and face although my face has had dramatic improvements as well. **My checkup Achievement:** For the first time since I can remember my doctor isn't changing my medication and has said that I don't need to schedule a follow up appointment at this time. I will continue to have a steady supply of my personal med cocktail without worrying about running out. I'm under no obligation to pay for schedule drive to or stress about coordinating my life around another psych appointment until I feel it's necessary.**TLDR: Some years/some decades are worse than others. If you can't remember the last time you caught a break don't give up. We all deserve peace and stability. Today was my day.**",Bipolar

45563,"I FEEL GREAT - worked out changes in my routine So I stopped seeing a doctor for a while. When I was with her she kept me on Lamotrigine the generic one got me up to 200-something mg. I also was prescribed some Stilnox which was totally awesome if not for my shitty depressive episodes where I would try to sleep all the time and all the mania where I just wanted to hallucinate all the time. Anyway! The Lamotrigine made me feel so fucking awful. I was a zombie for the longest time. Felt no emotions no sex drive I was pretty absent as a girlfriend (which led to the demise of a really great relationship) no motivation to do anything from work to studies et cetera. It wasn't working so she kept up-ing the dose and also asked me to take some Inderal to calm down the increasing anxiety I had.I stopped seeing her as I've mentioned. It wasn't just the medicine but it was also because I just didn't feel comfortable speaking to her anymore. She wasn't super awful or anything. There were just subtle instances where I would feel shitty about some things she'd say. Since the break up I realized I needed to get help because I was so not mentally healthy at all. I stopped seeing her in the middle of my relationship because of reasons listed above but also because I refused to believe that there was something wrong with my brain. I just wanted it to all go away and convince myself I was normal. Currently trying some different doctors looking for The One. Meanwhile - This is probably not advisable but because I can't wait between appointments I started self medicating. Went totally sober. No alcohol no cigarettes no weed (which apparently turns BPD people schizophrenic or something? Which sucks because it was so great for the anxiety) no popping benzos - or any other drug. Started working out more consistently. Controlled my eating. I went back on the Lamotrigine BUT this time I started taking the branded GSK Lamictal. Started with 50mg. I paired it with 10mg of Inderal. I FELT SO GREAT!!!! I was having episodes all the time but this calmed me down in a non-zombie way. I started building a tolerance to it though - I think? My anxiety would come back worse. Weeks into this routine I went up gradually to 250mg of Lamictal and 40mg of Inderal. I'm feeling really great. I know it's not mania. I just feel healthy and normal. I think it's helping me keep to my routine cope with my break up be more productive. I'm on my way to becoming a better person I think.

45564,"Death of Seasons [self-hatred] (/spoiler) I was listening to one of my favorite songs from grade school and I realized that it fits perfectly in describing how I feel towards depression my will to survive depression and the angst remorse and grief of falling into a depression. Here is the song: . . . &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Of late it's harder just to go outside &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To leave this deadspace with hatred so alive &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Writhing with sickness thrown into banality I decay &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Killed by the weakness but forced to return turn it off &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I watch the stars as they fall from the sky &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I held a fallen star and it wept for me dying &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I feel the fallen stars encircle me now as they cry &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Out there so quickly grows malignant tribes &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Posthuman extinction excels unrecognized &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Feeling surrounded so bored with mortality I decay &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All of this hatred is fucking real turn it on... yeah &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It won't be all right despite what they say &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just watch the stars tonight as they as they disappear disintegrate &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And I disintegrate 'cause this hate is fucking real &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And I hope to shade the world as stars go out and I disintegrate"" The first stanza starts the process of slipping into depression. It’s hard to leave the walls that are now built around you the hatred drawn inwards is real and deadly. Leaving is an escape but the mind of depression “forces” you to return inwards retreat back home and continue the stages of decay even violence: “Killed by the weakness…turn it off""The second stanza is how I see this process of suffering being reflected in the natural world through the observation of stars. I am reminded of the title of the song “Death of Seasons” which is organic and relates to nature. There is compassion inherent in seeing the suffering of them: “I held a fallen star and it wept for me” / “The fallen stars encircle me” is an act of compassion by nature itself reminding me that the feelings of depression and disconnection are universal.The third stanza is also about the outside world but a reflection on society and other people which is viewed as working a brutal and threatening agenda (malignant tribes). For me viewing the world at large in this way begins to give birth to thoughts that lead me to believe that the world is cruel and that I no longer wish to participate in it which completes the process of depression and fatefully gives rise to the momentum of wanting to take my own life.The bridge or last stanza is a confirmation of the reality of depression merely the way things are so to speak. The vocalist directs the attention to the sky and sees the completion of the cycle the end of the season when things wither and die. Yet compassion for the whole world is alive “I hope to shade the world as stars go out” which still amazes me that in the throes and thick of a hard depression the parts of me that want to help and be a part of the world live on.",Bipolar

45588,"Medication adjustments I'm frustrated . 22/F Bipolar 2. I need a rant . I'm in college. I struggled with schooling my entire life I guess for the simple fact that things don't hold my attention or interests for long. Pair that with depression and random hypomania anxiety and well... nothing good. I dropped out of hignschool but got my vrade 12 and now I'm trying to better myself . While I'm doing better than before due to medication it's still a struggle. Back in February 2017 I made the hard choice to see my doctor and have a referal put in to see a psychiatrist . Since I live in a shitty area we have one fly in once every so often. So when I seen him he put me on lamotragine and said that was the issue at hand to be dealt with first then we would see what the next point of action would be (ADHD depression anxiety). Since I've been doing well with anxiety he suspected ADHD would be next and seemed to think I would be able to notice after the dose was increased a few times. Fast forward to today. I'm on 150mg of lamotragine clonazepam as needed (when I get aggressive panic attacks etc). I was leveled out for months at 125mgs but had a checkup for refills back in October where my family doctor increased them because the psychiatrist wanted to see about getting me up to 300mgs. Since it was what the psychiatrist wanted family doctor wanted to keep increasing to ""see what the differance is""... I was hesitant because I'm in school I don't want to jeopardize anything and this dosage I was on was tried and true as far as I was concerned. After telling him how I felt he said ""your feeling good now maybe you could be feeling better"" so... benefit of the doubt I did as I was told. Yesterday I had another appointment. I went in figuring it was the usual routine. Told him I couldn't concentrate I was feeling distracted often and easily and my interests were shifting pretty often so I was concerned. I asked to see the psychiatrist again to talk about ADHD since that's what was suggested before and seems to be what I'm dealing with. I was told WE DONT HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.... BUT would very soon and I would have a referral put in to see him/her for when we do and they visit. Awesome right? So now he wants to lower my dosage back to 125mgs to ""see the difference"" which is the same shit I was told when he increased it to 150mgs. I don't want to do that. I'm uncomfortable possibly distressed about the thought of it altogether since I'm so sensitive to these things. I can't afford a hypomanic/depressive spiral right now not while I'm in school... so I'm thinking I'll just keep my dosage until I see another psychiatrist.... FML",Bipolar

45592,"Dad needs help with son's bipolar 2 My 18 year old son was diagnosed a few weeks ago with bipolar 2 with psychotic features. Prior to this he was being treated for anxiety with zoloft. About a year ago he started smoking pot to help with the anxiety and convinced me that it was better for him than zoloft. As of last October he started zoloft AND weed. Since then he's had deep depression and some scary ""rages"".He agreed to go see a psychiatrist and that's when he got the diagnosis. The doctor prescribed Latuda but he complained about extra anxiety then when the dose went up to 40mg he had a severe reaction of akathisia and panic attack. So he stopped taking it and we have an appointment in a few days with the pdoc.He keeps insisting that we find a drug with no side effects or he goes back to smoking. He thinks the doctor is stupid and isn't worried about how THC might make paranoia worse.I don't think he knows just how irritable he is almost all the time. I walk on tiptoes worrying that something I say will trigger a 2 hour lecture. Looking at other med options it seems Seroquel might be better since it helps with anxiety but he looked at the side effect list and balked. How do I convince him to keep trying until he finds something that works for him? This seems like a catch 22 he thinks he's smarter than the pdoc but that belief would go away on the right med.

Anywho as indicated I'm experiencing my second manic episode in a four month period despite meds. I'm not complaining! But what I'm getting at is that I'd appreciate if you just bear with me. TIA.In my last manic episode I expressed my hypersexuality by posting in GoneWild-essque subs. That's what I'm doing this time but also selling content and it's just not enough for me. I want to meet some of these people I encounter and it all just seems so RATIONAL in my head. Like not everyone is a serial killer right?

I've steadily been in relationships for almost 10 years now and only been with two people in my life. So it seems fair to want to explore a bit doesn't it? But I don't think it's fair that I'd have to sacrifice my relationship to do so. Ugh.I really can't afford to be in this kind of a headspace. I'm starting college back up tomorrow and I love my life. I had a talk with my boyfriend though and he said once he is comfortable with what I'm already doing we can explore the idea of me having different experiences and such. So I wasn't shut down so that's good. But I started to spiral because he asked if it's something I would risk our relationship for. And I explained that it feels like this is what it will take for me to be happy and I don't think it's fair to leverage my happiness against our relationship so I couldn't answer...

45594,"Sleep-talking and Restlessness with Bipolar Disorder? I've struggled with Bipolar Disorder for years. I'm almost 20 and I notice a lot that I end up sleep talking. I've had a couple occasions where I wake up in the middle of the night and I start having a conversation with one of my friends just like I would do at any other point in the day. I would feel like my friend is sitting in the chair in the corner of my room just having a conversation with me in the dark and I will wake up and talk for a couple of minutes (what it seems like at least) before I seem to pull out of it and freak out a little when I realize that it wasn't real.It gets WAY worse when my boyfriend sleeps over at my apartment. When I used to stay at my ex's house as well I remember sleep-talking over there.When my boyfriend slept over last week I had at least 4 instances within the night of tossing and turning where I started having nightmares and then talking through them. There were a couple points in the night where I ""woke up"" and shook my boyfriend on the shoulder and started talking to him like he was my old best friend Shelby. I began talking to ""Shelby"" about how our friendship had been on the rocks but we should try and be best friends again. He was mostly sound asleep and wrapped his arms around me and I remember thinking ""Oh that's not Shelby"" right before I fell back into a short but deep sleep.It happened with another nightmare that same night I woke up crying and saying ""I don't know why you would do this why did you have to do that? Why did you cheat on me? You know loyalty is so important to me"" because in my dream I guess my boyfriend had been unfaithful or something and I was in the in-between of asleep and awake and I started lecturing my very-faithful boyfriend on why he dream-cheated on me (lol). But after a minute of talking to him (he's a heavy sleeper so he didn't really fully listen right away to what I was saying) I snap out of it almost every time even just a little bit and realize that I wasn't actually having a convo with anyone.It's a really bizarre scenario and it's happened a few times.Another one I can specifically think of included sleep walking and sleep talking at my ex's house. I started having a full-on conversation at 3 am after having been sound asleep and I started talking about how I wanted to watch the movie School of Rock (idk why haha). It's hard because it's not a full-on sleeptalking I don't think. I have a weird experience where in the moment I am aware that I am having a conversation even though I think my body is about 10% aware that the people I am talking to are just from my dreams.

45597,"Acceptance...for now. I've been on disability for a good while now. Anyone on disability can probably relate to the strong desire to be away from it. The Social Security office generally treats you like a criminal you never know who agrees with the negative stigma and sees you as some sort of lazy leach on society and some days you fight with the notion yourself. Many people tie worth to one's ability to work and contribute and it's easy to fall into that realm of thought where you feel worthless and ashamed. Anyway to my story. Around June last year I was put on a game-changing medication. My anxiety disappeared seemingly overnight and I felt more confident and comfortable than I have for most of my life. Gears started turning in my head. I could go out among the people! Maybe I could find some companionship and stop feeling so lonely. Maybe I could earn my keep and feel some pride for a change.This lead to me starting a second part-time job with the intention of ramping up my hours carefully and slowly the goal being to eventually be making enough to support myself without the SSDI check Medicare etc. I was certain I was on track to being an honest ""normal"" person. I took on more and more responsibilities. Things were looking good for about 6 months.Then the medication turned on me as it seems they all eventually do. Every day things get worse. While it still keeps the majority of my anxiety at bay I now have a persistent depression. I've lost interest in many things including wanting to do a good job at work. I let things slip do the bare minimum and count each second until I am able to go home. Increasing hours at a job that I am having less and less of a tolerance for seems like a good way to speed up an inevitable crash and burn. If something doesn't change soon I will likely have a breakdown and/or wind up in the hospital.And for what?Before I started the new med and took the second part-time job I was doing okay for myself. My first part time job was enough to keep me connected to the outside world even though the pay might have been considered token at best. I kept myself busy with personal projects. At times I felt lonely but I had friends. I had trouble with anxiety and depression but I had time and space to cope. In my current situation I feel like I'm on a speeding train. There are no time-outs when I am feeling terrible. What time I have for my own interests is tainted by dread of the next workday and this consistent low current of depression. The second part-time job has made the first one *the one I found rewarding and enjoyable* feel like an inescapable chore. All I want to do now is go home and hide. All this effort put in to build a ""respectable life"" and dig myself out from under disability and I feel so much more frightened fragile and trapped than before. No medication has been effective for me for such a long duration. I was certain it was the one so I ended up biting off more than I could chew. Now I'm dependent on a drug that makes me miserable and puts me in a precarious emotional state every day. I stress out and hide from my responsibilities. Every day I feel inadequate and not up to snuff. And why? Because I felt guilty for being on disability? Because I was certain that life free off it would be better? That I couldn't have companionship self-worth or be among the living if I wasn't earning my keep in traditional terms?After much thought *I have made a conscious choice to ""regress.""* Clearly working full time is not an attainable goal for me right now. I'm cutting my current average of 15 hours per week at my second job to around 7. Between it and my first job I'm likely looking at around 10 a week which I think will be manageable. Also I'm getting off the ""wonder drug"" that keeps my anxiety at bay at the cost of my sanity and happiness. I will regroup stabilize and *find some damned peace.*Being off disability wasn't in the cards this time and *that's okay.* There's a reason I was put on it in the first place. Maybe I will find an opportunity to be financially independent in the future maybe not. But I will stop with the self-shaming. I can still have a worthwhile life whatever the circumstances. **TL;DR - I found a wonder drug thought it would finally get me off disability. It didn't and that's okay.

45602,"New diagnosis new medications (Abilify) and of course new questions Hi everyone! A little background here before I ask any questions:I've been struggling with mental health issues for approximately eight years now and I am twenty-years-old. I was ""officially"" diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2016 and started an anti-depressant. It worked alright at the start but I continually seemed to be on some sort of a wave. Sometimes it was really really bad but then other times it seemed like everything was fine and I couldn't remember what it was like to be depressed.Over time this lead to me having more questions/concerns and I spent some time doing research and combined with some family history this resulted in a personal hunch that I might have some form of bipolar disorder. I was pretty convinced I might have bipolar type II.In the past few weeks I finally found got enrolled with a Nurse Practitioner and I was able to talk about the crushing depression I was feeling. At first she decided I was experiencing severe depression and sent me for blood tests before she planned to increase my Wellbutrin prescription. However after my blood tests and talking some more she did further screening. Based on the questionnaires I filled out and what we talked about she and the doctor she works under confirmed that I have bipolar disorder. Despite the fact that I had been thinking about it it was still a shock and I'm trying to get myself oriented in this new world.Now about new medications... Originally I was going to be given lamotrigine 25mg twice daily but the nurse practitioner had to consult the doctor to figure out if I would stay on my Wellbutrin at the same time or if I needed to be weaned off Wellbutrin first. In the end they decided to keep me on Wellbutrin add Abilify once daily at night and if I reached the max dose of Abilify without optimal results then they would add lamotrigine or another mood stabilizer.So last week I started Abilify at the 2mg dose. I take it at approximately 11:00pm and then go to bed. However I am having a tough time figuring out if my symptoms over the past few days are related if they're typical if they're likely to last etc.**Disclaimer: I know that you cannot provide medical advice nor do I want medical advice from strangers on the Internet! I will be telling my nurse practitioner everything when I see her next which will be on Wednesday of this week. I am just hoping to find some insight from other people who have taken Abilify and had similar experiences or who can provide additional reliable resources about Abilify because I am struggling to find this information myself.*** The nurse practitioner told me that they wanted me on Abilify to help me get better sleep. However I don't find it makes it easy to sleep at all. The first night I ended up being mostly awake until 7:30am and then slept until 10:30am. The second night I was awake until 1:45am and slept until 10:00am and I had similar patterns the rest of the nights so far. Last night I went to bed around 11:00pm as usual and still was up until around 1:00am and woke up at 5:25am. I know that it takes a while for medications to really start working but is this at all normal? This is almost worse than my sleep lately before I started it.* I keep feeling so so sick. The first day I got a little bit queasy but didn't think much of it until I woke up and couldn't get out of bed at first because I felt so sick. Over the weekend it made me so sick that I missed two shifts at work because I couldn't be bending over and lifting things up and walking around. I actually threw up once but that was it. I did some research online and ended up making the decision to try taking gravol with it but I know it can make me more drowsy and it's definitely causing dry mouth. I'm wondering if anyone else has taken Abilify and had this problem? Does it go away over time and only come back when changing doses?* Last night specifically while I was trying to sleep I experienced something I don't think I ever have before. I think I had some auditory hallucinations I heard a repetitive noise and then it was almost like people were talking despite the fact that I was alone with my boyfriend who was sleeping soundly. I've never had them before and I don't understand where this would come from. Could it be from taking the Abilify? Or is it likely unrelated and coincidental?Thank you in advance to everyone who reads and/or responds! ",Bipolar

My situation is as follows I’m a guy 18 years old have been struggling with bipolar for years where the hospital seems to be my second home.. recently out of an abusive relationship where I impulsively chose to pick up and leave my home my family and my everything all of a sudden to move in with my ex 1000 kilometres away with her parents... that’s the extent of how my mania gets along with episodes of psychosis.Recently I’ve been looking for work and I found what I thought would be a great job at a health food store I aced the interview and trial then came the first day...I went in full of smiles and just my best to be positive as I’ve been in a big low lately then all of a sudden I get there and I’m handed the most ridiculous jobs and well all they would do is put me down and make me feel like I’m absolute f*ckin trash. Now I don’t know if it’s because of my arm which they all saw (covered in scars) or if it was because I chose to not go to college (year 11 and 12) when they’re all university graduates or students.. I don’t know but they were horrible and I was pretty much in tears for my whole lunch break.. I’m a fragile bloke when I’m going threw a low is all I can say.. Anyways I got home having a huge anxiety attack so stressed I could feel my impulsiveness and psychotic symptoms coming out.. so I sat down chain smoked till I couldn’t breathe and sent my boss an email full of excuses trying to make myself sound normal about quitting after 1 day.. I had to quit I really did if I had thrown myself into that job it would of sent me right back to my lowest low.. the thing is while I got the job I was experiencing a manic episode where I talked myself up Beyond imagninable and asked for 40+ hours a week knowing I couldn’t handle it but that’s just the kind of stuff I do...So that’s my little rant of today’s horrible events :/ if you were able to actually read it all then well thank you and send me a message if you wanna chat..

45612,How can I tell if it's just anxiety or hypomania/mania? I already have tons of anxiety about facing things in my everyday life. But I feel this agitation this growing desperation and neediness that I can't shake. It's sort of eating me alive and it feels like anxiety but I don't even know why I'm anxious and it doesn't go away. It just builds in me and I keep trying to distract myself. It's not as if it's triggered by something specific it's just there constantly in the background. I also have zero appetite and don't feel tired unless I take a lot of sedative supplements but that isn't so abnormal because my eating and sleeping can be all over the place at the best of times.

45616,"WarningIs this a Manic Episode? [Please HELP] [x-post /r/bipolar] I've been diagnosed with bipolar by three different psychiatrists. I kept asking for different opinions because I thought I was ""simply"" afflicted with major depression (on and off for about a decade!).I've finally accepted the diagnosis and started the treatment but the pills that the doctor prescribed are exclusively to treat symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disease (Lamictal). For the past 5 days however I've been experiencing something **very** different:* Some of my thoughts seem foreign to me in the sense that I **know** they don't make sense but I am still drawn to/consumed by them.* I do and say things that are completely outrageous. Even though I am perfectly aware that they are outrageous I somehow can't stop myself.* It's very easy to trigger my irritability. I am screaming loudly and aggressively and using profanity at the slightest of provocations.* I am vicariously living some fantasies. When I say vicariously I mean that I am having extreme reactions of nostalgia over things that never happened (fake memories). It's strange in the sense that I **know** they are fake but at the same time I believe them?My head is a big mess. I don't have any answers. When I'm depressed none of this happens. Right now I feel like I have more than one person inside my head. There is the rational side the side that is aware that something is off the side that is writing this. And then there is the unbalanced side the side that is causing all this havoc.The only thing that seems to help is to go clubbing or to a place with a lot of noise. It somehow makes my thoughts more clear and leaves me more relaxed (even without the help of alcohol).Has anyone experienced any of these things? I am scared but I end up driving away everyone that tries to offer their help. ",Bipolar
45617,"Happiness I feel like there's been a lot of posts on here lately about people fearing that happiness or stability will turn into hypomania. This made me think about how much it sucks that people with bipolar have to approach happiness in ways that others don't.For the first time in years a bunch of positive stuff is coming together for me: I'm (for the moment) financially secure my job is challenging but not overwhelming I have the chance to work on a really cool project the weather is nice (where I am) I've been running again and signed up for a race and after careful tapering I'm down to my lowest daily dose of Klonopin in 9 years. For someone without bipolar it would be obvious that this combination of things would make someone happy and you wouldn't question that this is a great thing! But since I have bipolar I'm already like: am I happy or am I *too* happy?It just seems kinda unfair that we can't just be happy when nice stuff happens to us. People with unipolar depression who begin to feel less depressed have nothing to fear (unless their SSRIs make them manic and turn into one of us mwahahaha). People who have anxiety and become less anxiousgreat! People with bipolar who finally reach a balance...nope! Better be on the watch for hypomania!It just seems like we're not allowed to enjoy being happy....",Bipolar

I was recently prescribed Modafinil to take with my current combo of meds (rexultitrileptal vybriid) and I’ve started to get frustrated at the lack of effects from the Modafinil which I assume is because of the rexulti (dopamine antagonist).

I think I’m going to try and convince my psych to let me taper off the rexulti and increase the trileptal. Does anyone know if trileptal is also a dopamine antagonist? I’m so frustrated!!

Just last year while in jail actually after coming down from a manic episode and then spiraling further into the latter I was finally confronted again with my type 1 bipolar diagnosis. I was lit back on my meds (depakote ER trazadone gabapentin and prasosin) and stayed on them until being transferred to a rehab facility (as a result of trauma undiagnosed/misdiagnosed bipolar I developed a really shitty and extreme addiction issues) where they were ""hostilic"" and took me off my meds. One manic episode in and they made a exception for that rule quickly....lol. after that and making a ""timeline"" of my relapses and it being made clear as day that taking my meds for me is a matter of life and death because of my addiction I stayed on them and stable for a few months. I had a slip where I stopped taking my meds went manic after a week relapsed but was able to catch myself before everything went to shit...but again a few months later the same thing happened I wasn't so lucky and have been stuck in another relapse for a few months and self medicating.I now find myself very aware I need my meds. J talked to my therapist today who essentially told me that I need to accept my diagnosis and that I need to take my meds if I want to succeed based on all the past times I've tried anything otherwise. I've had intentions of calling my psych doctor I plan to but I'll pick up the phone and put it down. Or procrastinate it.

45634,"I Found What I Was Looking For I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in April 2012. I've struggled with the illness since I was twelve-years-old and initially I was diagnosed with unipolar depression. I've been hospitalized more than ten times. I've been suicidal countless times. Without my medication I experience so many manic breakdowns-breakdowns that are terrifying. I came to terms with my illness in October 2016 after losing someone that I love with all my heart. When this person severed our relationship I realized that I needed my medication to make the paranoia the delusions and the recklessness go away. It was through this loss that I saw the light. But it was as of recently that I realized the way I treated people and myself and my perspective in life was also unacceptable. I have a strong support network but I disclosed everything under the sun to anyone who would listen which is not good for anyone's self-esteem. I was the proverbial empty barrel that made noise-all the contents of my barrel would spill out into the ocean that is life. I was unable to love myself so I sought that love in others. I revealed everything about myself in the hope that someone else could soothe my pain only to scare away people that just wanted a healthy relationship with me. I am sharing my story because medication saved me from the mania but it was mindfulness that saved me from myself. I realized all the love I need is within myself and that I don't need to turn to others to soothe my emotions when meditation coupled with medication can lead one to find the peace and bliss we are all looking for.

45652,"Hypomanic phases+hypersexuality=social suicide *disclaimer: I understand that this post is insanely long but I feel condensing it will dilute its message. Some of this is unrelated to my bipolar II but it still plays a central role in my issue so I felt this would be the best place to post this (plus I don't know where else to post). Little new here. I've been suffering from the symptoms of bipolar II along with social anxiety since my early teens so throughout middle/high school it crippled me socially. My rapid awkward all-over-the-place speech in my hypomanic phases and my mumbly confused speech in depressive phases (if I even spoke at all) along with anxiety kept me from really connecting with anyone and i was never able (and still am not very able) to display my true self something that crushes/depresses me to this day. It also SERIOUSLY held me back academically/athletically. I was a straight-A student with a promising competitive swimming career up until around 9th grade when my disorder had grown to an unmanageable level due to it going untreated and it continued to for the rest of high school with my relatively strict parents calling it bullshit at every turn and never getting me in any counseling or put on any meds until i dropped out of college at 18. Only then did they listen and see an issue. Knowing that I never realized my potential in any area of my life sends me flying into bouts of extreme depressive episodes in which I cry over what could have been and it can last days. I only thought I had depression at this point so I was misdiagnosed for another year. Now at 20 I am finally diagnosed properly and on a mood stablizier although it hasn't been particulary effective and smoking weed and dropping acid probably doesn't help matters. But I must admit that my first couple trips allowed me to take inventory and understand that I've been bouncing between manic/depressive phases since childhood and that my issue quite possibly extends into sex addiction/hypersexuality. And it brought certain behaviors and memories to the surface that I wasn't willing to face and it's a big reason why I'm even here posting this (I DO NOT condone the use of LSD especially for the people on this subreddit). Now we get to the main point that the title addresses (not sure if I had to give ya'll my life story first).Throughout my adolescent life a common theme has been my complete and utter lack of control of my sexual impulses resulting in shameful behavior that I keep buried away from many: public masturbation. At the beach with a towel over me in the nearest public bathroom and even IN CLASS. I knew it was disgusting as I was doing it but simply HAD to get off constantly like some nympho. I could only dart to the bathroom throughout the day so many times (our monthly hall passes gave us a limited number of times to leave class). After reflecting I feel that this urge was aggravated by a combination of my hypomanic phases (which involves being too horny) and my hypersexuality bringing my sex drive to an INSANE level. If this is the case then it would explain that behavior. It doesn't justify it but it gives insight into how this happened. And teachers did NOTHING to address it. Unless the kid's autistic I would have confronted me about it if I were in their shoes and it may have gotten me the help I needed sooner. Because they turned a blind eye it continued to fester and get worse. I understand that it's not their job to counsel me but such extreme behavior warrants attention I was very sick and nobody helped me. There is one exception in which we were watching a movie in class a year after I discontinued my in-class meat-beating. A risque scene comes on and my teacher promply says ""Ok settle down John."" to which the class erupts into the most intense laughter I've ever heard that rings in my ears to this day. So if anything they made it worse. I quickly became known as that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class bc well.... I WAS that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class. I never stared at some chick's ass to set it off mind you if anything I blocked out the world to focus on my animalistic impulses. So if anyone wants to call me a gross creep save it bc I'm already aware :( But this realization that it may not have been my fault that I'm not a complete pervert really makes me feel better and could bring me at peace but I feel I cannot confirm it without getting some outside opinions and I don't want to go to anyone else (friends family etc.) other than my psychiatrist bc I'm so shameful of it and I fear they would look at me different for the rest of my life. I've just been hurting for such a long time and I'm desperate to get answers about this bc I'm too hung up on it and I likely will continue to be until I come to peace with it.Thanks",Bipolar

45658,"Lamictal / Pristiq / Wellbutrin - Bad Combination? Hey all -First I am a male in my early 20s.I have been struggling to find the right mix of medication for me. I am not formally diagnosed with BP - my doctor classified it as depression at the beginning.My experiences with medications began about five years ago. I originally started with small doses of Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) and Wellbutrin (Bupropion HCL XL). 50mg of Pristiq and 150mg of Bupropion. Still didn't feel 'right' so the doses got upped over the course of a year or two. I eventually was taking 450mg of Bupropion and 200mg of Pristiq.A year or so later my doctor added Lamictal (Lamotrigene). Began at 50mg went to 100mg and eventually 200mg. At this same time my doctor decreased my dosage of Pristiq. I was taking: 100mg Pristiq / 450 mg Bupropion / 200mg Lamictal. Lamictal seemingly helped the most out of all the drugs. I was not feeling extremely low ever (i.e. hurt myself).Looking back it seems like a whole lot of medications...did I really need all that? I began to feel suppressed. While I didn't experience extreme lows their was not any highs either. It was just flatlined. My sex drive was also non-existent. I am in my early 20sAfter speaking with my Dr. we decided to lower some of my doses. He briefly told me what lowering the doses of each of my medications would do and he gave me the liberty of experimenting a bit. I slowly trickled down to what I am currently on: 25mg of Pristiq / 150mg Bupropion / 200mg Lamictal. I do not feel as emotionally suppressed as I once was nor do I feel extreme lows. Everything seems to be okay aside from a few things. I know that life isn't perfect and being 'happy' all the time isn't normal but I do feel like I am missing some happiness in my life. Another major issue is my sex drive. It is still completely ruined and it is beginning to affect my life and overall well-being.I guess my questions are: Anxiety.csv Bipolar.csv Depression.csv Normal.csv README.md Stress.csv Suicidal.csv bep-bile cleaned-output cleaning.sh disorders mental-health-dataset.csv mental-health.csv sorting.sh statements status.csv Was taking all three of those medicines at high doses a bad thing? (In other words is my doctor not giving good advice?) Should I seek out a 'second opinion'?* Are there any ways to combat the sexual side effects that you have successfully utilized?* Should I consider talking with a doctor (my current Dr. or a new one) about changing things up if so do you have any personal experience that would lead you to suggest a specific change here?Thank you for all of the help!

45673,"Some tips to save $$ on Latuda I keep seeing a ton of posts about how expensive Latuda is for people and of course many posts about how helpful it has been. I must say for myself it has been helpful with the depression but its certainly not a fix all for me. So with that I wanted to share some tips of what I have encountered along the way with trying to afford and stay on this medication. There are some options or relief available. Not sure I'd call them solutions but instead kind of band-aids. Ultimately it wont get better until generics come out but from what I have read it doesn't look like the patent will run out till like 2026 or thereabouts.When you get the script from the doc make sure to ask about samples if they are not provided first off. I got lucky and I have to say I was on this med for probably a good 3 months just on samples alone. Perhaps my practice is a bit more forgiving on that front. I told them I had problems with getting the cost (which I did) so they gave me more samples to hold me over till payday. There were also times I ran out before the pharmacy could get an order in and in which case they gave me samples to hold me over till I could get filled. Get the discount card!!! It says pay as little as $15 which for me brought my cost down to $150. Not great but far less than what it was. [Latuda copay Assistant](https://secure.latuda.com/secure/latuda-savings.cfm). Check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. Unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. Some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. For me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about $1300/US. Check if you have a prescription deductible. I did and at the beginning of every year it renews. So I was surprised to find that my drug I was getting for $150 was now ringing up at $400. Sadly the only way past this is to pay it. But once paid my cost was back down. McKesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost. That is right **FREE**. Just today I got my second free 14day supply of latuda. Call them up at 1-855-5-LATUDA and you can speak to a rep to get this. They will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card. Lastly I was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. I'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as I have not yet attempted to go this route. This will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. In order to do this you would call the same number above 1-855-5-LATUDA and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance cost/pay. I only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so I called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did before transferring me to another. Anwyays hope this helps some of you. The preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. Its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. Edit: Looks like the patent does expire on July 2 2018. So perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.",Bipolar

Previously I was missed diagnosed with depression and general anxiety. I’ve been on and off the same medication since I was 16. It’s currently not working so I’ve had to take a break again to try something new. I’m currently coming out of this depression part of my cycle. Usually the hypomania comes next because I’m so stressed out about how hard I fucked up whatever happened in the 3/4 weeks of depression. I struggle a lot with trying to cope self harm. I use to cut for almost two years when I was in high school which was be main reason I got on medication to begin with. Throughout the years (16-21) I’ve gone on a few binders. When I was younger it was MDMA &amp; alcohol when I became older it was alcohol. But was all stopped by the fact that I was pregnant. My kids have been the only reason why I haven’t slipped back into drugs or alcohol. I’m currently in outpatient treatment I guess you would call it that. I go see two doctors to talk and sort out my feelings and try and find a program fitting for me. This has been the hardest fight of my life. I thought this was over but after I had my son it creeped right back for revenge. I had him in 2016 and I’ve basically missed half of his life because I don’t remember from being so depressed or my anxiety. I’m in this place in my life now where I don’t even know where I am at everyday waking up. I feel like I don’t have a path anymore. I’ve lost focus in my career right now I’m trying to pull myself back into this but I can’t. I’m mentally so exhausted I just feel useless. I fight so hard everyday to keep myself alive and calm and then my two kids all alone. I choose to put myself here and I constantly wish I didn’t.

45686,"Happiness or Anxiety or Hypomania? Hey fellow bipolar people! I have a question...how can you tell if you’re just in a really good mood or if you are going into hypomania? The two times I was manic I was having lots and lots of irritability and insomnia and a ton of anxiety. My doctor suggested those were manic episodes based on what I could remember. Now whenever I’m feeling particularly good I’m constantly worried that I’m not actually happy but instead hypomanic. For example I had a good day at work. I got a project done and I got to socialize with my favorite people. Usually work can be a somewhat dramatic place but those people were out today. I’m home now and I’m feeling good as in not tired or socially exhausted which is funny because I’m typically an introvert but mostly around people I don’t know. I also have a tremor....which is usually a sign of anxiety or that I’m really hungry. Big anxiety attacks have resulting in my legs shaking uncontrollably. Can happiness cause anxiety? I don’t feel anxious that often around other people. Maybe I just have low blood sugar? I’m on Lamotrigine and Effexor and I take Hydroxyzine at night to sleep if that makes a difference at all. I’ve been sleeping throughout the night this week which I think is a good sign.Any thoughts? I’m going to ask my therapist too next week. ",Bipolar

45692,"Experiences with Lamictal and hypomania? Experiences getting off Lamictal? Hi! This is my first time posting here. If I may do any of you have experiences with what I put in my title?Here's some (not super necessary for answering my questions) background:I have a diagnosis of Bipolar type 2. While for many reasons I still believe this to be accurate I've been questioning the role that Lamictal has played in my illness and diagnosis.While I had had many sort of hypo-hypomanic periods before and had actually been diagnosed before at age 13 my first full blown classically symptomatic hypomanic episode coincided with starting and then increasing my dose of Lamictal. This particular episode was used as a part of my diagnosis. (I started Lamictal due to a severe upswing in my depression and history of not responding to antidepressants.) The hypomania eventually faded back into my more typical depressions and general emotional static. This was then further complicated by the addition of other meds that I did not do well with at all. It's a bit of a tangle so attempting to determine if there's any sort of clear chain of cause and effect is difficult.I've never had any other side effects but I've also never really felt any steadier on Lamictal. Lithium is what eventually became a total godsend for me.All of this is to say that I don't know if Lamictal has actually done anything positive for me. Yet I've been kept on it ever since and I'm questioning if this is only because I haven't had any side effects to complain about. If this is true is there really any point to continuing to take it long term? If I don't have to spend the money every month and continue to risk the known short term and unknown long term side effects I'd rather not.So has anyone else experienced hypomania that coincided with starting or increasing Lamictal? Has anyone gone through getting off of it? What is the process of doing that like?I am of course not going to change anything without talking to my pdoc. I'd just like to hear from some other people with personal insight.Thank you!",Bipolar
45693,"My [21f] Doctors Keep Suggesting Lithium Hello everyone. This is my first time posting on here but I just wanted to say I really love the support community in this subreddit.Before I go into my questions here's a bit about my symptoms/meds: I'm diagnosed as Bipolar 1 with rapid cycling. My current doctor has me on a very high dose of Lamictal Wellbutrin and Seroquel. Nothing seems to be helping right now the episodes are staying just as intense (and quick) and I feel like I can't get any relief.I wanted to ask all of you about your opinions on Lithium. I was seeing one psychiatrist for years that had asked about my opinion on Lithium and I said I didn't want to go on it. She dropped it after that and decided to raise my Lamictal. It helped temporarily. I ended up relocating kind of far away from her so I decided to see a new doctor. She also asked me about going on Lithium but I'm still really apprehensive. My concerns are centered around the fact that my grandmother actually suffered a Lithium overdose and she's never been the same since then. I'm so paranoid that that will happen. Has anyone with rapid cycling had success on Lithium? Does it really do the ""zombifying"" thing people talk about? The event with my grandma happened a few years ago are doctors more cautious with the blood testing and everything now? TL;DR my doctors keep prescribing Lithium but I'm very apprehensive has it been successful for other people with rapid cycling?",Bipolar

45698,"Bipolar and shrooms Hi just last year I was diagnosed bipolar type II. I'm not really clear on my diagnose since I've never been on a manic state my psychiatrist says I have hypomania. But the truth is that most of the time I'm really depressed. I get triggered by an ongoing relationship with a friend that used to be my boyfriend but now just see each other from time to time and have sex. We love each other but kind of in a friendly way. This new relationship dinamic that has been going on since December last year has been a real struggle for me since I really don't want to loose his support and love and sex. It means a lot to me maybe the only thing that keeps me going on. Most of the times we don't talk during the week and I wait for him to talk to me this makes me very sad and it triggers my depression. Not long ago I decided that I wanted to do shrooms. 6 years ago I did them but I was naive and a fool I did a very low dosage and I was a very different person from now I didn't get very much insight. Now I would like to consult with magic shrooms 1 gram to start off. Last year has been a rollercoaster for the meds. Right now I'm taking 250 mg of lamictal topamax 25 mg 3 times a day risperidal 0.5 mg and 200 mg of quietapine. I'm really open to all suggestions I'm hoping this can be an eye opening experience that will help me in the future maybe help me being so dependant on relationships.I'm thinking about doing this with a friend we would like to do it on a place with lots of nature. The first time I did it was on the woods and I was really happy and connected to the greenery of the forest. Please let me know your opinionsEdit: please so that you may understand a little bit more about my relationship. I do not feel like I'm in a bad relationship. In fact we have a great dinamic and connection and we understand and love each other. We decided to stop labeling as girlfriend/boyfriend because right now it can bring so much stress in this period of our life's. It my case it was making me enter into a very dependant attitude and he was sucking up all of that energy and getting depressed too. So we decided to break up stop seeing each other with the same frequency start acting more like friends and when we see each other indulge in sex as a natural and healthy activity and enjoy or spend some time together watching movie hiking on the nature. So if you see we have been doing this maybe 2 months or so. We see each other every 2 weeks or 1 week. He tells me that this year's that he is focused on creating and expanding his work not really looking for a girlfriend and I do believe him so when he tells me this. I'm really on the same boat with this I just got a good paying job I'm painting eating healthy taking my meds exercising a bit sleeping on time.He will be travelling on June maybe to Europe 3 months and it will be tough for me but I think that that time will be a deciding period for me to think things over. I will miss him very much but it will make me a tougher woman I'm 28 but sometimes I still feel like a little afraid girl.

45705,"I took a shower and it was glorious Since the beginning of December I've been struggling with a couple of manic episodes. As the month went on I noticed a spike in my anxiety but it was around the holidays and I was able to get a handle on it for the most part with my Xanax prescription. After a negative experience with my father during the holidays my anxiety only increased until by January I couldn't get a handle on it. It developed in to full blown paranoia. I was (and still somewhat am) convinced I was being watched especially from the strip of woods behind my house. Every time my German Shepherd would let out a guard dog bark at the back door I would lose my shit. If I needed to go to the grocery store I would go either very early in the morning or very late at night when there would be virtually no one there. If I turned to go down and aisle and saw another person there I was overcome with a sense of uncomfortable dread and would wait in hiding until I saw them leave the aisle and go elsewhere. This lasted me all of January and I shamefully only showered maybe two or three times from the beginning of December to the end of January. I kept my hair tied up and didn't brush it unless I was going to shower. My first shower since maybe all of January or at least the middle of it and when I went to take my hair tie out it just kept getting more tangled. I had to have my fiancé cut it out of my hair and when I tried to unwrap the bun it wasn't unwinding. I asked him to look at it and he was shocked and told me my hair was completely knotted together. Luckily he was able to untangle it without having to take scissors to it. And let me tell you even with a detangler brush the layer of knots on top and underneath my hair were RUTHLESS. My hand cramped up during it and my eyes may have teared up a couple times but I got through it. Unfortunately for the past week and a half I did not shower and did not brush my hair. Same results as far as my fiancé having to cut out another hair tie and unknot my hair but that shower was HEAVENLY! I got the shampoo super lathery and just scrubbed every inch of my scalp. Then I let a deep conditioner sit while I washed my body and was able to do a second wash after I rinsed the conditioner and used my medicated body wash for my body acne (chest back and even upper arms!) I put all my products in my hair- about 8 totally I believe- and exfoliated my face and neck and put on a super moisturizing mask before doing my normal skincare routine. I'm going through a manic episode now and was up all night but I was able to take a shower and get ready early enough to actually be on time for once since my best friend/Maid of Honor was coming over so we could go to my mom's and get my Save the Dates addressed and ready to finally send out seeing as they were supposed to be done end of December/early January. I also did 4 hours worth of much needed cleaning and decluttering. I feel very accomplished and refreshed but at the same time a little invalidated because most of this most likely wouldn't have gotten done if I wasn't manic. Still my hair is soft my skin is glowing and my Save the Dates are finally done!

It's made school difficult at times but I've done my best to keep my shit together and I'm in a graduate program that I absolutely love and working with people who are amazing. I know how to meet deadlines even in my worst episodes and I've learned how to harness the (very rare) hypomania for productivity. I accidentally confided in my supervisor and told him that I was dealing with a particularly bad bout of depression (not my worst though). This spiralled into him being excessively worried about me and reaching out to other people and him phoning/texting me to check up on me. I've had moderate suicidal thoughts in past but I can usually handle them (or I know to go to a doctor immediately if not). I was emotionally exhausted but doing okay before he started worrying about me. I'm afraid that his concern is pushing me deeper into this depressive episode though because he's made it feel more serious than usual. He was worried I was suicidal and that made me think about suicide more than usual and freak myself out about it. (I ended up on the phone with him at 2AM crying because of it...)The thing is I know it passes. I deal with it all the time. I know my worst-case measures and I'm prepared to use them.

At first we met he was in relathionship and I didn't knew that. We were just acquaintances but we liked each other. He had that conversation with me that he likes me and that he is in relathionship with that girl for one year and I told him that he shouldn't reconsider breaking up a serious relathinship just because he likes someone (in that case me) and after that it passed one month. We didn't had contact. Suddenly he showed up and it looked like he broke up. He told me that he is free and that he felt nothing for that girl so we started dating. He looked really really in love with me and I sstarted to love him. We had a great relathionship and everything went just perfect. but for one year. Than he had that ""cold waves"" we called that state like that. As he told me he had for a very long time a big problem with retrospective jelosy. Sometimes it affected on us. And sometimes he had a periods when he as he said- felt nothing to me but that he cared for me. I gave him space and tried to understand and wanted him to be free to make decision if he wants to be with me. And our relathionship lasted one year like that. He never had a relathionship longer than one year. In our case we lasted for two years. But the second one was filled with all those ""cold waves"" he felt. And the last wave when we broke up I gave him a freedom again but it seems like now that he really choose to move on and it looks like he really don't love me.

45715,Possible Misdiagnoses? During the winter of 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar I generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder PTSD and a few years earlier ADHD. At first I felt that my diagnoses made sense and I was willing to take my meds. While there were times where I accidentally or deliberately didn't take them I was mostly consistent. I did in fact feel better in time though there were many ups and downs. The summer of 2017 I felt that my medications were working amazingly. I was productive holding a job writing a book and overall happy. Beginning my first year of college even started off well. Towards the winter I became very overwhelmed but everyone was due to finals. I expected when our winter break came I would calm down. Throughout the break I had very low energy and a few major mood swings. I convinced my boyfriend to go on a road trip to California with me in the span of a few hours. I felt very excited and couldn't stop talking and laughing. Once we got there I was back to feeling depressed and unhappy even more so because I thought going on a trip would help me feel better. I thought maybe the cold weather was what had me down but the change to warm weather made no difference. When we got back in early January I took it upon myself to go off my meds cold turkey (which I know is not the best thing to do and I don't want to suggest that to anyone else). I expected my symptoms to worsen from withdrawals but nothing really happened. I was slightly more emotional and less zombie like but nothing major. Since then I've only been taking Mydayis for ADHD and I've felt a lot better than I have in the past five months. I've had relatively normal moods getting sad when something saddening happens or vice versa. This leaves me extremely confused. Is it possible that I don't have the things I was diagnosed with? Or could my symptoms just be taking a break? I had extreme mood swings at the time of my diagnoses and even in the summer briefly. I really just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or has any thoughts.,Bipolar
45716,"Health effects of long-term (&gt;6 years) use of lamotrigine? (Particularly related to chronic inflammation and low-grade flu-like symptoms) Hi allI've been on 250mg lamotrigine for about 6 years now. It works fantastically. However during the same period I've slowly developed a kind of background inflammation that's basically the same as very minor flu. It's there almost all the time - some days better than others - and is sometimes accompanied by muscle aches/sprains and a slightly sore throat. I also feel like I'm extra warm to the touch.No doubt the timing is purely coincidental and I have some other problem but I figured it was worth researching. Unfortunately however I can't find much about long-term usage and the only articles that refer to those symptoms are acute allergic responses.Do any of you have views/experiences here?

45719,"I just really need to rant about the aspects of bipolar disorder I’ve been struggling with the most lately: side effects mania moods.. It’s been almost a year since I was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder &amp; my first and only manic episode. I cringe so much when I think about the time I was manic. I know I need to be nice to myself because I literally had no control over it but I just hate the person I was for like a week. I thought I felt empathy for the first time in my life and also thought I could read minds and was super obsessed with eye contact and the subconscious mind. Classic bipolar shit. It hurts to watch shows that depict people having manic episodes. I wish I could just erase that part of my life which I guess I am doing to the best of my ability. Just blocking it out. Didn’t happen.But now I’m on lithium and lamictal which have thankfully allowed me to at least seem sane to other people but honestly I’m lying when I say they’re making me feel all better. They’re not. Lithium fucking sucks. I have no appetite. I’m nauseous 97% of the time and eating makes it worse. I used to have such a beautiful figure but I’m getting so fucking skinny my curves are going away. I tried to eat a lot two nights ago because I really want to gain a few pounds but I ended up feeling so nauseous I just can’t do that often enough to gain weight back. And the fucking flaking. I feel so disgusting. My skin has never flaked before but my left ear now flakes so much daily. I hate it.And probably the worst of all it feels like my head is no longer mine. I can’t trust my thoughts or my feelings. As soon as I start to get passionate about something I start speaking quickly my mind races my hands start shaking and boom I’m hypomanic thinking about all the weird shit I thought about during mania making sense of things that don’t exist. I can’t even fucking explain that to anyone because none of my friends have bipolar disorder and none of them get it. So I’m just trying to act normal while my head is just being literally insane. This almost entirely defeats my ability to feel joy about anything literally. If I’m not hypomanic I’m just stuck in depression. I feel really alone. I miss who I used to be before all this happened.I wish I could just turn it off you know?

This is all coming off the back of a month long depressive episode with a lot of suicidal contemplation which was finally ended by an increase in seroquel to 300mg an increase in lamictal to 100mg twice a day and a decrease in lithium over the last few months from 900mg a day to 300.

I'm going through some shit right now which is kinda relate to this but for a while now I've been trying to understand if my 'normal' is really normal or if there's something I need to get checked out by a professional.For as long as I can remember I've struggled to control my emotions in the context of what's around me and most of the time I've been acting accordingly. If I'm at a party and I'm supposed to be having a good time I might still be super upset about the fact that my favorite TV show has ended and what's going to fill that void. I attended my brothers funeral carried the coffin even and I wasn't that upset but people are watching so I tried my hardest to cry and look authentic. Later on of course I was distraught but my emotions were always out of sync with reality. My mood guides everything I do. I'm of pretty normal intelligence I think I went to school am told that I'm pretty logical in my thinking but I just can't seem to do the most basic things. I'll sometime go a couple of weeks without a shower (not proud to admit that) because when the opportunity presents itself to shower I'll be engrossed in something so deeply that the thought just gets shrugged of until next time upon which is just repeated again. Sometimes that things I'm doing is just sitting down staring into space thinking but it feels like important work. Other times I can't stand my own skin and shower three times a day. There's no normal middle ground!My mood can often change at the drop of a hat too. I immerse myself in work and over extend what I can handle because it keeps my brain from being Moody or reacting to stuff around me but someone will make a benign comment like they're going on holiday and if I get an envious thought in my head it just multiplies into this intense deep deep depression where I sneak out of work and drive somewhere (I'm trusted to manage my own time) to be alone and sink further and further. The scary thing is I sometimes embrace this mood it's like I need it and it feels comfortable to be sitting in a car crying by myself. I'll carry this mood with me all day usually acting normally in front of the family when I get home and making an excuse to go to bed early because I know that also is the best chance I get to reset.

If I'm down I'll think about every word and choose them so carefully I'll filter out crucial information because I don't want the Dr to think badly of me.I want to be told that someone else is liked me I want to hear that medication is there to help me I want to stop being up and down all the time so I can focus on sitting out the other problems in my life like normal people do.

Struggled throughout my early 20s and finally got my life under control by my late 20s. Met an amazing woman and got married. Managed to find a meaningful career and had a few years of amazing success. Two wonderful kids. About 4 years ago my career started going south. There are several reasons one of which was a move to different state then most of my freelance work. My wife also got very sick when pregnant with our second child and I ended up getting into a bad pattern of care taking without taking care of myself. Especially when it came to sleep. As the money stopped coming in I started selling some stocks that I owned prior to our relationship. I ended up selling almost all of it and cashing out the majority of our small but important IRA over the course of 2-3 years. I never shared any of this with my wife and never reported any of the money as income. Fast forward to 2017. Almost all of the stock is gone (and I still haven’t told anyone). We are practically broke and borrowing money from family members repeatedly. A few weeks ago my wife demanded access to my brokerage account. She decided the best way to fix our finances was for her to take complete control. The jig was up. My huge violation of trust was revealed. I truly believe that deep down I am a good person. I have a good heart and I am a very caring and loving father and husband. But with my terrible actions and hiding and lying about it it is clear that I am sick and need help. I don’t know what caused this manic episode but I am sure the fact that I sleep 5-6 hours a night so she can get a full 8-10 hours of sleep every day didn’t help. She says she loves me but hates my guts right now. She says she loves me but is terrified and feels like unsafe. She says she doesn’t know if she can stand to have me in the house or will ever be able to see me as a romantic partner again. I haven’t been in therapy since my psych died in 2011. I’ve been seeing a nurse practitioner once every three months to keep my prescriptions up. But clearly need to find a new doctor pronto and get intensive therapy. Not just medication management. If I didn’t have children I can’t imagine what I’d do to myself. But I love them and I love her so much.

I'd just randomly push people away(mostly guys I'd have a crush on)... It's like I was upset with myself for thinking about them so much and I figured the only way to make it stop was to push them away but I'd almost regret it afterwards. When it came to female friends I'd just disappear on them for months at a time. Also I'd have impulse control issues during these phases but it would only come on randomly like spending money overeating sex drugs drinking etc. It's weird because in daily life most people would never guess I have these issues since I'm really nice and I try to keep these problems to myself and my mom and my therapist.

This person was diagnosed with Bipolar with serious manic episodes and treated for about 13 years. The meds were hard to take and she was a bit up and down with them. There were some serious manic episodes that led to dangerous situations. There was little I could do but I did help keep her on track and try to keep her honest with the meds.I realise that it must be so awful to have to take dulling medication and I'm really sympathetic to how these manic events and dropping off Lithium built up. I don't want to sound judgemental.Fast forward to now. As of three years ago I no longer have any influence or connection but have stepped in to help in a really bad episode. It's become clear that she has not really taken her medication seriously for three years. She's been totally freewheeling. The illness I saw in her recently was very different to what I knew from before. I had seen her as driven and worked up but her moods were cycling from extremes within minutes. It was frightening.I have read up as much as I can on bipolar and rapid cycling. I get the picture that some people advance towards this after every major episode and that it tends to be progressive and not go back to being a single flavour at a time so to speak.Can anyone who has experienced bipolar progressing like this (in yourself or in a loved one) give me a perspective? I'm concerned that she's progressed past some kind of horizon and things are going to be harder for her even on Lithium now. Just a gut feeling.I would appreciate hearing relevant experiences.

I was coming home every day with no energy to cook dinner or clean and mostly just spending my evenings watching tv and or crying. I didn't know what to do. There's an extra element of stress to a stressful job when you're bipolar as I don't know if the job is really the problem or if I'm going into an episode. My 1-up manager was away on a Friday so I spoke to my 2-up manager and said I wasn't coping with the stress and would like to hand in my resignation. I didn't ask for any special treatment just offered my resignation. He asked me to just think about it for the weekend and we'd discuss it again on the Monday. On the Monday he brought my 1-up into the discussion. They offered me some leniencies and said they'd figured the job might actually be a 2 person job back when they hired me and they'd reassess the business plan and asked if I'd be happy to stay if the job was cut in half. I said I couldn't offer a commitment but I'd be willing to try. At the end of that week I heard from one of my colleagues that my 1 up had told him that I ""spat the dummy"" and ""didn't want to do the hard work anymore"". I was furious. I was humiliated. Not only was my supposedly confidential conversation with management not confidential but it was totally changed to make me look like a whiner. I spoke to my partner and he agreed this was not on and that I need to get out of that place. So I took a week of stress leave (sick leave officially). During my week off sick I received 47 (not a typo!) calls from work from people expecting me to do things and make decisions. While I was sick! I realised the only time I was badly stressed during that week was when I woke up and had that instant dread of thinking I had to go to work and when I received a call. Otherwise I felt ok. I called up on the last day and resigned. Today is my 5th day of unemployment and I am so so happy. I feel almost back to normal again. I still get stressed if I think about having to apply for jobs but that's ok because I've decided to give myself at least 6 weeks off to decompress from that stressful job before I start looking again. *The point of this message*: no job is worth more than your mental health. Save money! Be prepared to be unemployed for a while if you need to because shitty jobs will come along and you need to be able to get out.

I assumed my worsening depression/anxiety were withdrawals but by week 3 I ended with akathisia that has really fucked me up.Pdoc took me off it immediately and prescribed me 0.25mg Xanax to take as needed (which I had been taking one or two of intermittently to cope with the transition) It's been 12 days since my last Latuda dose but I'm still having major depression/panic/crying fits and I'm concerned that the longer I take the Xanax the more reliant I'm going to become on it. I'm already taking between 1.25-2mg/day and while I'm having more frequent periods of stability it's sometimes taking more Xanax to get there and boy do I come crashing down hard once that 5 hour mark passes.Has anyone had similar experiences coming off Latuda?

There were times when I felt my pdoc was dismissive and I had to stand up for myself to make myself heard. It can be so hard because in the end they’re usually just trying to help and I feel bad for being almost confrontational. I’ve learned what situations you should badger an office and when you shouldn’t. This is the shit you learn when you deal with this bullshit disease. And I need to badger my school’s DR right now. For some reason they haven’t granted me excused absences (which I had no issue getting at previous institutions) and those are so much more important than getting extended testing time...And I know how it looks. I KNOW. It looks like I want a legitimate way to slack off but that isn’t what happens. I did my best to not abuse those previous accommodations because they were my saving grace at the end of the semester. I’m not completely incompetent. I can follow the syllabus text classmates and do my best to keep up with the class materials. But sometimes I just cannot leave my bed.So much has gone wrong this past month. Life has just taken a huge shit on me at the beginning of this semester and I need help. I have an established relationship with a psychiatrist in this new town but I need a therapist. She gave me a list and I’ve been playing phone tag with her top recommendation and I just *can’t* anymore. I don’t have the energy. I’m here by myself away from family freaked out by my creepy neighbors and just struggling in general. The only two things I can focus on are my schoolwork and taking care of my dog. And everyday I feel like I’m failing at even that. My house is a mess. I’m a mess. My eating habits are horrible. I feel the temptation of hard alcohol everyday... so I binge eat then starve then binge. Luckily my alcohol consumption hasn’t gotten out of control tho I am planning on cutting it out completely again. I thought discussion questions were due at midnight on Sunday’s but they’re due at 8 pm. I had confused between two different class’s deadlines. My prof has been so understanding but god I need to show I’m not trying take advantage of any slack she has given me. She’s been so great at balancing having compassion but not coddling me. I really like her. And I’m just asking for this one thing from my school. Their department is a fucking mess. My psychiatrist had dealt with them before and said she needs to be contacted by them first before writing any sort of letters detailing why I need this accommodation. I told this to the DR but they insisted that wasn’t the case. So I call my psychiatrist and she insisted that that’s how it’s always been and won’t write anything until she’s contacted by them. Then my assigned counselor sent me a passive aggressive email that the recommendation I had sent in did not explain why I needed an ESA. Shit lady I was not asking for a fucking emotional support animal! Get your fucking shit together. Family connections can be great tho my mother works at the university and knows the chair or director or what fucking ever of the DR and insists that I call him and go over the counselor’s head. But god I just do not have the energy. I don’t have the energy for any of this. Sometimes I wish I was still a minor so my mom could just make my appts for me. For the first time in years I just want my mom to take care of me like she used to. I don’t want to be responsible for dealing with this shit.

45772,Does this sound bi polar??? This all started last year when I started to feel really sad and depressed but here was no reason for it and then after six months I wouldn't feel it at all. I would feel like I'm on top of everything and I was doing really well in school. And now it kind of feels like it's happening again. But slowly creeping in on me. Like my grades are going down I sleep more. I have become way more self-destructive and impulsive when it comes to my friendships and I can be just sitting at my computer looking at stuff and feeling content and instantly just go to sadness and pointlessness and the only way I feel like I can get rid of this is to go to sleep. Because when I wake up it's like my mood resets and I try to keep myself busy from my thoughts because they get really deep and depressive really fast. Does this sound like bi-polar or am I just over analyzing this?,Bipolar

My BF made a doctors appointment for me (because i was to nervous that the receptionist might ask me what the problem was and i know i would have freaked out if she had asked me and i don't know why) Now im really anxious about this appointment just incase i tell the doctor everything and hes gonna tell me im being too dramatic or maybe not even believe me. im having my BF come with me for support but i know im gonna get so nervous im not gonna be able to speak because i know im gonna forget all of this.Any insight or advice i would be so grateful for.

A is also currently treating for PTSD and has a bad case of seasonal affective disorder. One month ago everything was fine. We were engaged no issues planning to leave the state and this bad climate/latitude in the spring. Then overnight there was a sudden withdrawal of communication. This usually resolves in a few days.

But I've always had extremely huge trouble actually getting creative work done even though I'm never not extremely passionate about my projects even when I'm really depressed.I'm now on Lamictal and have been for a few months and holy f'ing shit it makes such a huge different and I think it's going to save my entire future. One thing I wasn't expecting was that it's given me tons of insight into what feelings and levels of excitement and joy aren't actually normal because I now barely ever get them totally randomly out of the blue (except when I was off the meds for a few days and it was... yeah). But obviously they're not 100% gone.So the point of the post is...I'm realizing so much about why putting in the time to create things was always so difficult: because pretty much every single time I would then hypomanic-ish feelings would come up and it would make functioning so difficult. I would usually get so overstimulated I had to stop or I'd keep going but then have a massive crash into depression a few days later if I started working on something at night then instead of sleeping after I'd have to spend hours obsessing over how amazing the thing I'm making is. And I guess I knew this already that this happens but now it's like ""WOW SO THESE FEELINGS **AREN'T** NORMAL? NO WONDER THEY INCAPACITATED ME"". And because I'm more consciously aware of them I've been trying to practice working on stuff WITHOUT getting sucked down the rabbit hole of having these intense feelings. And even on drugs that help it's fucking difficult. I can do only an hour of being productive and then my mood and energy is just totally different afterwards and it's so exhausting but stopping and trying to relax immediately helps me not spin into something for hours or days that leaves me completely drained. And also it's no fucking wonder that my anxiety around starting a work session never got better after years because it could result in such intense draining awful things.So I'm wondering who here can relate?When I read about bipolar I don't see anything about how the uppy-feelings can be triggered so incredibly easily and consistently by one thing which is why I didn't see things from this perspective before. But now that I don't really get those feelings randomly without reason since being on Lamictal I see how abnormal they are and now recognize that's why other creative people are able to get so much done because working on something creative for over an hour doesn't make life into the most exciting thing ever in the world. But even on pills I still get the feelings pretty much every time when working on anything I'm passionate about.

This did nothing to help my depression but helped me avoid instances of hypomanic.After a very failed experiment with Zoloft in late 2016 we settled on Wellbutrin SR 150mg which while it has helped my depression supposedly had the tendency to increase my anxiety. I would not have initially known however because I was also taking 1mg of Klonopin per day.Fast forward to October of 2017 at which time my doctor told me that he wanted to wean me off the Klonopin because extended use can cause cognitive impairment...which I was initially unaware of.After weaning myself down over many months to a quarter pill in the morning and a quarter pill at night I have found this dosage to be completely ineffective as to my anxiety. I have a very stressful job which does not help matters at all. To make matters worse my psychiatrist has effectively retired and I have to begin seeing a new but from what I hear very competent psychiatrist in mid-March.I don’t know if this is relevant but I have also been sober for six years.I know that every person is different but what non-benzodiazepine based medication have you taken to assist with your anxiety?

I'm anxious and irritable and bitter and hopeless and yet I know logically that I have no reason to feel this way.I was on medication for six months before I stopped taking everything cold turkey. The lamotragine and wellbutrin had helped a lot at first when I was in a similar state last spring but I wasn't convinced that I needed them anymore (or that my bipolar diagnosis was even accurate) and I was a couple of weeks away from losing my insurance indefinitely.It's been a whirlwind of a winter. I went through it all:Euphoric hypomania around the holidays. Huge spending not sleeping or eating hanging out with everybody falling in love lots of drinking and partying and being merry. I could so easily sink karaoke in front of hundreds of my coworkers at the holiday party or confess my love for my best friend or *be curiously spontaneous*. Followed by a crash. Depression. Self medicating. Waking up with a feeling of dread. Not wanting to leave the house go to work get out of bed. I quit my food industry job stopped hanging out with friends stopped replying to texts and calls.Started feeling better for a week or two before *bam* here we are. Mixed episode.I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want to be on medication or accept that I have bipolar but I'm willing to try if it gets me out of this horribly distressing mess. I don't know where to start except to post here and not be in the dark about what I've been going through these past few months (as well as the past decade). And I'm fortunate to have a wonderful psychiatrist. It helps with going back.Words of encouragement needed.",Bipolar

45804,"Experiences with Lithium? My doctor prescribed me lithium 300mg ER twice a day. I have been extremely reluctant to start the medicine because of the dumbest reason ever the notorious weight gain. I take care of myself pretty well with the exception of a few beers every other weekend or so (definitely nowhere near drunk). I go to the gym 4-5 days a week and eat relatively healthy. I just recently lost a few pounds and am still trying to lose more (personal preference I'm a healthy weight). I drink probably around 10 glasses of water a day. Does anyone have experience with weight gain on the med? I read online that part of it can be attributed to an increase in sugary drinks to accommodate the extreme thirst but I only drink water with a cup or two of coffee/tea in the mix.

45807,"My new psychiatrist doesn't agree with my current diagnosis Starting in 2009 (age 17) I had increasingly awful depression reaching a peak in late 2014 (age 22) when I checked myself into hospital for 5 days outpatient then 7 days inpatient. After this my meds were switched from Paxil and Abilify to Effexor XR. In early 2017 (age 24) after gradually increasing the Effexor I was bumped to 225mg a day. This sent me into a hypo manic episode for a week until I dropped it back to 150mg. My body couldn't keep up with my mind I had no filter and I did things without thinking.This lead to my psych to change my diagnosis from Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder Type 2 rapid cycling as we believed that this wouldn't have happened if I didn't have bipolar paired with how I had described my depressive episodes as wave-like/ebbing and growing for years. I added on lithium 300mg 2xday at this time.Now I'm in a new state and have a new psych (age 25). I went to her last week for Rx refills and because I had the worst short-term depression in years. I couldn't work or even get out of bed for 5 days.She says the the Effexor Lithium combo seems to have helped with some issues (anxiety bulimia self-harm) but isn't doing enough for the depression. She upped my Lithium to 300mg 3xday and is seeing me March 13th. Her main issue is that I don't have any issues with sleep during my ""up"" periods. I sleep normally. When I'm depressed I sleep a lot more and have trouble getting up in the morning.What my issue is: If I don't have bipolar what are the other possible disorders I could have? What runs similarly to bipolar but isn't? Is there such thing as cyclical depression? If I don't have bipolar what the hell was that episode in early 2017?

45811,Bipolar II; I just went through my third extreme manic phase ever Some background: I was in and out of the ER in January four times within two weeks because of some undiagnosed pain I had mistaken for a ruptured appendix. I don’t know if it was all the pain meds or weird sleep schedule or what but right after the last visit I was thrust into a manic phase (I guess just a really major extended hypomania technically) for the third time in my life. When I was young my bipolar II was misdiagnosed as depression because the hypomanic phases were not so pronounced and I was on Vyvanse for ADHD the same time as my antidepressants. It was about 3 weeks of minimal sleep maximum spending obnoxious/incoherent rants on social media questionable fashion choices etc. This morning I woke up and immediately could tell I’m crashing. This is the hardest my depression has hit me in a really long time thanks to the contrast of the hypomania. I guess I just wanted to vent. I don’t have a therapist anymore and my mom doesn’t understand the depth of what manic phases are. She thinks it’s just not being tired and talking faster than usual.,Bipolar

45818,"Where and What next? Hi. I've had ongoing mental health problems for the past 20 years. For the bulk of it it was assumed to be depression. I went from Effexor to something else and then to Citalopram. Recently...well over the past 8 years really my behavior and moods have deteriorated. It destroyed two jobs and one long term relationship. I had a full psychotic breakdown complete with hallucinations over the weekend. That was my personal breaking point where I was able to finally admit it could be more than depression. I went to the doctor that day rather than wait til monday like I planned. I am now on anti-psychotics and am waiting to hear back from a specialist but based on everything he's heard I most definitely have bipolar.My lover is no longer my lover. We had been together for many years. She says she still wants to be friends with me but I do not believe she will be able to do so as I worry she won't ever be able to see past my behaviors while being improperly treated. I did not cheat on her but I was verbally abusive absurdly egotistical and prone to addiction and believing positively bonkers things. Now we're trying to move to separate places. I still love her but I have to let go as I do not think she will ever feel positively towards me due to my actions or the fear that I might relapse while taking this new medication.My questions are as follows:* Work and Affording an apartment. How the heck do I do it? I'm working as a moving helper in Canada. That isn't exactly steady work here but I hadn't been able to concentrate well enough for better previously. Can I apply for disability or some form of assistance while I adjust to the meds and new diagnosis at least until I'm stable enough to work regularly to earn my rent/bill money?* Relationships. My family that I had previously abandoned have actually been quite supportive after coming to terms with what I am personally. My wife (common law) is no longer my wife. I do not think she will ever forgive me for the hurt I caused and I do not believe I may expect her to. How do I move on? Right now I'm trying hard to find answers and to stay busy as I can.

When this happened last summer I talked with my doctor and decided to increase my dosage of prozac. It did not work and I felt weird and had suicidal ideations.

45844,Waiting to get into a doctor I moved to Florida about a year ago and I had a lapse in insurance coverage. I used to be on a lot of medication that helped several things and finally had me functioning as an adult. I ran out of these meds about 8 months ago but I’ve been managing pretty well lately until this past week. I’ve been working a full time job and I deal with stressful people day in and day out. It usually doesn’t get to me but I haven’t been able to get in to see a doctor and I feel so frustrated. I’ve had some really bad lows and some mild highs but I feel myself dipping down really low again and I’m worried I’m going to fuck everything up. On top of having bipolar I also have ptsd and anxiety. Depending on how my bipolar is being treated these things kind of make one or the other worse at times. I’m just really frustrated and I’ve worked really hard to get to where I am and I don’t know how to keep control of everything when I can’t even get a doctors office to call me back and schedule me. I don’t have a support system anymore and I just feel helplessly lost. I don’t usually post personal stuff like this on reddit and I’m on my phone and pretty mixed up so sorry for poor writing. ,Bipolar
45845,Meltdowns at work and ruining relationships advice? I’ve been struggling with bipolar and I’ve tried so many different meds none has worked for me. In the past 2 years I had 2 ectopic pregnancies which triggered a meltdown that required me to transfer to a different location. Then I had a meltdown in November because I’m so exhausted with my current job. It’s customer service and sometimes I have to handle picky clients. Started taking just klonipin to help my nerves. Ended up causing a huge fight because I took too many and felt like I could stick up for myself for once. Broke up with my boyfriend. Ended up getting back together. Things haven’t been the same since. Long story short I recently found out that during that time we “broke up” he added was talking or trying to talk to girls on social media. I’m normally not the person to go through peoples phones but I had a really weird feeling by the way he was acting. I’m overly jealous. It’s a flaw. Which caused another meltdown. Well i really can’t control my moods at this point. I’ve been crying at work 24/7 recently. How embarrassing. I started partying too much again. (Black out drinking klonopin weed) I can’t sleep at night. It’s the only temporary fix that makes me happy for a moment. I did stupid shit I’m too embarrassed to even say the past couple weekends at parties. I feel super guilty too. I tried killing my self either last weekend or the weekend before. I cant even remember because I’m too mentally drained. I can’t get these thoughts out of my head. I feel guilty and I hate myself. I don’t feel bad for myself at all. I think I’m a disgusting human being and really don’t care about life anymore. I would call off but if you get so many points you get fired plus I really like the people I work with for the most part and don’t want to leave them hanging. So ANYWAYS (after that nice short summary) I don’t feel mentally stable to go to work for the rest of the week and I have a mandatory 8 hour meeting tomorrow. Honestly I don’t even think it’s worth going good to because I want to quit. I don’t have a back up plan set in stone and i don’t even care anymore. I’m that done. I want to move far away and start over from scratch or I’m probably going to kill myself sometime soon. Rant over! Sorry for how long it was. I’m desperate at this point.

45847,"Bipolar Boyfriend Hi everyone I'm new here so please go easy on me if I make a mistake.My boyfriend (whom I've been dating for over one year) has bipolar disorder. When we started dating he was in a hypomanic phase luckily he got out of it in a month or so instead of it escalating into full blown mania or another psychosis. He's had psychosis several times in his life and it's been difficult for him sometimes. He needs to take medication daily.I have some questions about certain behaviour and would like to know if this is common with people who have bipolar disorder.-Being indecisive. He'll say one thing one moment and when he's with other people they'll be able to change his mind in a minute. He'll tell me/promise me one thing one moment but then completely abandon those promises and stop caring.-It's very easy to talk him into doing something that he usually wouldn't have done on his own. I'm talking: drinking way too much and suddenly just smoking when he quit smoking for months. He also has a hard time when I ask him about this type of behaviour or when I get upset.-He used to be very sure about our future but ever since a couple of months ago he's been doubting things and he hasn't been sharing his feelings with me or telling me how he feels even when I ask him. He's tried to break up with me two months ago to which I said ""are you sure? Do you want to give it all up?"" (Calmly and respectfully not mad) and he ended up not breaking up with me. He's been threatening to break up with me again.-He often gets really tired and sleeps till late afternoon he's been doing that for months. He lost motivation to look for a job as well. He had a job interview but he cancelled last minute last week. He was too anxious to go. I often feel as if he's just very insecure.-He'll say that the reason he never responds when I'm talking to him (irl) is because he just can't think clearly and his mind is just blank. (However I think this could be because he doesn't like to be confronted when he's lied to me)I've never experienced him in a depressive manic state before and he doesn't feel anxious when he's outside he doesn't feel as if they're spying on him and stuff. Which he definitely did when he was experiencing hypomania. He believes the craziest conspiracies when he's actually manic so I don't know what this all means.It would help me if y'all could really enlighten me on this subject. I was hoping to talk to his therapist about this tomorrow but he has been ignoring me and suddenly is hanging out with friends (he's out with one friend who's done hard drugs right now). He says he's never done harddrugs but this friend does get him to smoke and drink too much when they're out together.We had fights several times last week and yesterday but he is just refusing to make up ignoring me and instead just seeing his friends or he'll sleep over at his parents' place. (Even though I don't live with him so he could just stay at his own place but he always feels the need to go to his parents which is why I think he's insecure.) Any advice? What do I do and what do I say to him? It's been difficult for me to understand everything which is why I'm here. It's also been difficult because him changing his mind constantly is so confusing to me I never know what he actually wants because he'll constantly tell me something else.",Bipolar

My earliest memory is sobbing alone on the swing set at 3yrs old bc the Puff the Magic Dragon song just made me so sad. I never made the connection when my grandmother said my uncle's were manic depressive. My mother clearly is too and my mom would argue that my grandmother is a hypocondriact. Beyond that my mother is a person who should have never had kids. I was up for adoption but she changed her mind last min. (Bad idea) My childhood was badly bizarre to say the least.The above matters because I *never* wanted to be like my mother. Selfish. Reckless. Embarrassing.

So here I am. Having a bad week at work. Wondering if my anger at other people's actions is warranted or if they notice my moods. Not trusting anything I think. Wondering when the Lamictal will start working and wondering at what point will it become too much?Any guidance you can suggest if you've felt like this is most appreciated.

Football helped the most just a pure outlet for all my rage. But now that im a married adult with kids I can barley function in the world anymore. My wife hates me and looks and treats me like im some sort of broken child. We havent had sex in months im 24 and buff as shit!!!

I cant fucking do this shit anymore Im suspicious of everyone arround me I day dream of just beating peoples skulls in for fun or anything to make my life have some kind of excitement. Pretty much just smoke pot all day for a chance to feel something like anything. But I live in the most conservative state in the country and pot is keeping me from holding a job. Im fucking bored of living not suicidal just bored to the point of depression taking Lamotrigine 100 mg does nothing but make me go to sleep and antipsychotics make me feel like im dazed and loopy but their great at night when my thoughts are racing so fast that i wont sleep at all.

Bipolar patients need mood stabilizers. Lithium or lamictal. That is what treats your mood disorder and for the most part what you will always need. Other symptoms either bipolar in nature or created by the mood stabilizer get treated by other secondary meds. Insomnia? Probably seroquel. Psychotic features? Probably abilify. Tremors? Gabapentin. Anxiety? Stay the fuck away from benzos even if they try to give them to you. Is this generally the consensus? I feel like in the mental health community people just think drugs are drugs and maybe something will work eventually. That feels sad from my perspective. I do 1800mg Li along with 10g seroquel to sleep as needed 25mg bupropion as needed during seasonal depression and 40mg propranolol for performance anxiety when I need to perform.

Which I'm a biochem student and I have finals in less than two months so this isn't ideal.

And stopping that helped a lot and then he raised my lamictal and it's still better than it was but not where it needs to be.I'd really rather not take amphetamines but if anyone has had similar problems with these or could suggest something that's helped them so I could do some research and bring it up with my doc in a few weeks thatd be wonderful.-also side note I think the lamictal was making me anemic so I doubled up on my iron and B vitamins so im not sure it might still be due to some level of anemia",Bipolar

I’m teetering on the edge of a massive down at the moment while my pills even out (just upped dosage) and alongside the other crap I always get really bad problems with my hands and coordination. I feel like I can’t close my hands properly as if all the heaviness goes into them and when I try to concentrate on them they just go shaky. My shrink says it’s a normal symptom of depression (lack of coordination) which is fine; my problem is that I’m a piano teacher and every time this happens it makes it almost impossible to demonstrate exercises for my students or convince them that good technique pays off. Not to mention I keep dropping/breaking things. Has anyone found a way to work around this? It doesn’t help me to have “proof” that I’m useless/bad at my job/clumsy when I’m in a down and like I said I’m definitely heading there this weekend.

I check the job boards and nothing is even interesting. I’m 40 years old never been married and don’t have kids. What I do is who I am I have nobody to share my life with nobody to make working worthwhile. I want to open my own business but I need to raid my 401k to do that. I don’t see the point in having a 401k when it’s likely I will die in my sixties. But everyone thinks it’s a bad idea to use my life savings to do something that interests me. If I show people the statistics of reduced life span for bipolar and they disregard it. If I only have 25-ish years left why shouldn’t I make it the best 25 years doing something I love? Why should I get a job that is just a job with no purpose other than to buy another day. The funny thing about starting my own store is the people who would never shop there think it’s a horrible idea but the people who would shop there and owners of similar shops think it’s a great idea challenging but great. My father literally told me to get a job as a janitor at the hospital. I want to do my own thing but I’m being blocked and told to do something safe. Is anything worth doing ever safe or easy? Hell no! I can’t escape the working class playing it safe. If you’re wondering this is the store I want to open; it would be called The Basement if you think about the kids from Stranger Things and the basement they hang out in then roll that forward 5-6 years what do you have? A place with music and books and games all specifically tailored to what they enjoy. The store would be selling specific genre records (growing at double digits %) dystopian/speculative/sci-fi/high fantasy books; and games like D&amp;D and Magic and Catan and similar things. Stores that carry everything and try to cater to everyone struggle but boutique style stores serving specific markets do okay and can develop a solid customer base. But apparently having done tons of market research and knowing the product and knowing the area and what sells and having worked in retail management for years are all indicators that I should do something “safe” maybe I should be a get a job as a bus driver instead.

They're always there but I'm always too exhausted to do anything and love the people in my life way too much. EXCEPT for when I'm manic. Manic lows or highs give me so much energy and that tends to worry myself and my boyfriend. The only time I really consider hurting myself is when I am manic. Often needing my boyfriend to stop me.I'm going to Europe in June and want to work with my boyfriend to create a safety plan for when I'm feeling like this. One of those ""when I'm feeling like this I'll do this. If that doesn't work I'll do this."" This isn't just for suicidal ideations but also other side effects to the mania.A big part of the reason I want to do this with my boyfriend is that he is far more concerned than I am that I'll do something I would regret doing or hurt myself. Biggest two concerns are me cheating on him or me hurting myself. Mostly this is to put his mind at ease when I'm away. He worries about me so much when I am here never mind my two months away from him.What are some good steps to have on the plan? And circumstances to account for?

Like unpleasantly stimulated unfocused bloated and I was up all night with insomnia and strange sensations going on in my body. I then read the ingredients on the cookies and it contained xanthan gum and tapioca starch and I decided to be cautious about those ingredients and didn't have any more cookies. I didn't however read the ingredients on the chocolate soy milk which turned out to also have xanthan gum. I kept drinking this for three days and my insomnia became steadily more severe and I started having to rely on sedatives again to sleep. My mood was also elevating and it became harder to focus on anything. I was feeling insanely promiscuous :S Then by day four my anxiety and panic skyrocketed. I ended up getting SO desperate feeling hyper social and feeling so needy and vulnerable and afraid that it made me reckless making dangerous plans needing to meet up with any man or else I was convinced I'd die. I NEEDED someone to hold me OR ELSE.... Almost got myself in some trouble and was NOT thinking at all. Thankfully I managed to stay in the house and not act mostly because my family came back early and I could no longer have any strange men from the internet over........Anyway since I stopped drinking that chocolate milk I still have anxiety but am finally feeling a bit... more settled......

TW: Suicide The more I talk to my boyfriend about his past it seems like he was demonized for having any emotions as a child and his parents were emotionally abusive and neglectful. He acted out in elementary school and attempted suicide and was sent to a psych ward where he was diagnosed. They’re not going to see that his parents were trash and used religion to mentally abuse him and shammed him for having normal human emotions/responses to their behavior. In the year that I’ve known him he’s been severely depressed with racing thoughts. He’s like your typical person with severe major depression. He has thoughts of suicide almost constantly. He claims he felt normal when he moved out of his house and he’s gotten worse since being back home. Can you go an entire year or two without mania with bipolar and only have depression? His description of mania is so hard to understand that I’m unsure if that’s just his “normal” mood of being pulled out of the depression or if it’s truly mania that he’s describing. He said a happy event will trigger it and it might last 1-2 days. He also has anger issues with the depression. I know depression can make you agitated and so can mania. Can you have bipolar and not have manic episodes hardly ever? Like be depressed for a whole year with no indication of mania or hypomania?

I was put on Lithium and built up to 900(?) mg over the course of 9 days i believe (300 for 2 days 600 for another 2 then 900 for 5 days followed by blood work after the 5th day). However after the second day of 900 I started feeling what I believe is hypomania(?) only to feel completely cluttered and confused after a few hours resulting in me feeling rather scared. A few days later I gradually became more and more agitated hostile and on edge for the most part.

The urge to cry also hits hard when I'm listening to music which I've been doing A LOT btw. Also with music I feel that its the only thing that calms me down somewhat. Yet it also hypes me up and makes me feel great. But that's somewhat besides the point I guess. I reached out to my doctor about this a few days ago and she wanted me to get off of the Lithium.

I meditate every day and during some months getting my self to sit still is a near impossibility.

When I got diagnosed a lot of things about my adolescence suddenly made sense. I suspected as early as age 15 that I was bipolar but was unable to get help for a few years. I have felt depressed since I was probably 9 and I started struggling with sleep/having manic episodes since I was maybe 12 or 13. When I was 21 I got to university and they had a counseling program. This was when medication began.The counselor and doctor just assumed I was depressed and had anxiety so we medicated that which caused further problems. I eventually stopped taking the medicine (couldn’t afford it and especially not if it was making it worse) and things went back to normal. So I guess that’s what I’m getting at. My normal is fairly stable. If 1 is a major depressive episode 5 is perfectly stable and 10 is a manic episode I’m probably at a 3 most of the time. The depression is such a huge part of me that even when I’m manic af it’s only ever a mixed episode.When I was diagnosed bipolar we started medicating for that and sometimes things feel okay for a little bit but I’ve gone through several meds and combos and almost everything makes me feel worse. I either end up somewhere on the mania/mixed episode spectrum or I feel no different at all. As it is a good cup of coffee makes me feel better than most combos I’ve tried so I stopped taking anything and I feel mostly fine. Just the usual 3-4 that I always am. But what I want to know is if it’s possible to actually end up happy. Is there a combination of drugs that will make me feel better and I just need to keep trying? Is there something that may be more effective than just drugs? ECT or some kind of therapy? Or will I always live a life of being a little bit depressed. TL;DR: fairly recently diagnosed BD1 always at least a little depressed. Is happiness in the right combo of meds something else or am I doomed to always be depressed?",Bipolar
45910,Latuda 60mgs Lamictal (just started-working way up to 100mgs) Lexapro 15mgs 2x a day Buspirone 15mgs 2x a day and weight gain Let it be said that I work out with a personal trainer 3x a week. My job is sedentary (office job) but I have a standing desk which I've just recently started standing at after lunch break. I'm doing the whole Keto diet (for a year) and granted I haven't been a saint on it I've had cheat meals on weekends and little treats here and there (also used to drink but have cut that out and used to smoke but quit that as well) but for the most part have been keeping my carbs under 50g per day and ideally I want it to be at 25g or under. My caloric restriction is at 1425 I'm female 5'4 and last month I weighed myself at 147lbs. I started off last year being at 137lbs (before working out 3x per day and before being switched around between many different anti-psychotics-Bipolar 2) which is MUCH more ideal and my goal weight is 125-130lbs. I understand it's going to take time...but I'm becoming impatient. I religiously write down everything that goes into my mouth and count my macros. My weight has done nothing but go up and I understand muscle weighs more than fat but I have a pudgy stomach full face and I can't seem to go down in weight. I will be more than happy to provide a weekly macro sheet if that would help any of you but I'm desperate for any advice suggestions or just telling me to calm the fuck down and just be patient :).

45913,"New job new problems So I recently got hired as a waitress! I love it and I rack in the tips all day so nothing to complain about there. HOWEVER I was blessed with the laziest coworkers ever. I have only been there 4 weeks and I’ll be juggling 10-12 tables all by myself because people just don’t want to do their work. I do this while maintaining all the little tasks such as replenishing ice making drinks running food cleaning tables. I have no problem doing it and do it with a smile but it puts me under a lot of stress and it can get frustrating. Managers say it’s a work in progress but I’ve yet to see any kind of improvement. I’m fairly new to my diagnoses as well I’m still learning how I function and what sets me off and how to work through the highs and lows. I recently discovered a new issue though. If someone comes at me I get into a fight or flight kind of mode. I used to be a snazzy biatch and tell people to pound sand but now my brain completely shuts down and I cry and try to runaway. I AM NOT USUALLY A CRIER OR A RUNNER. EVER. The incident that set me off last night was charging my friends card for $200 instead of $50 (he was cool and we fixed it) and then I had a coworker coming at me for not bussing HER table right away. She threw a glass at me and yelled at me in front of 20+ people. To add to the embarrassment I had customers coming up to me asking me if I was okay. I wasn’t and I went from a high to a low so I told my managers I needed to dip. Whatever that little scene she caused was messed me up. I drove 100+ all the way home not caring what happened and I’ve been in bed since then. I have to return to work today and I really have no idea how to handle the situation. My managers were understanding but how do I face everyone after they’ve seen me at my worst? I’ve also never had an episode happen in public or experienced a high and a low within the same 15 minutes. So I guess my questions are how do I handle it? How do I go back to work? And what do I say? And how do I get these feelings under control before they turn into a big problem? These are things I need to be able to control to be in a successful work environment and it’s something that I’m really struggling with. ",Bipolar

45916,"Lamictal and Memory Loss Hey everyone! I'm 17 here going on 18. I first started taking lamictal in early 2016 to treat my depression but only started taking it consistently a few months ago. I used to just take whenever I'd wake up which could range from anywhere from the early morning to late in the day but the only noticeable effect that it produced was that if I missed a dose my body would physically crave it. A few months ago I began taking it at a regimented time everyday as to give it the opportunity to properly regulate in my system. About a month into doing that I started to feel different. I've always been one of the sharper kids praised for my vocabulary and my writing ability (which may not come off in this post but I'm really just looking for help here). It's all that I really had to pride myself on at a young age and it carried over into just being a part of my identity; but over the past two months I've just felt like I've been losing myself. I struggle to keep up in conversation my word find seems to come and go and I just feel slow. I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level but I feel like a piece of me is missing. I've also been having terrible mood swings going from happy to sad to complacent to ragingly angry within about twenty minutes. I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level but I feel like a piece of me is missing.My biggest concern though is that I'm experiencing brain damage as I've banged my head up a little bit. This started getting really bad around the same time I started better regulating my dosage and I'm not discounting that as a possibility making it hard for me to figure out if it's my medication or if I just destroyed myself for the rest of my life. At the same daily dosage for nearly two years I've never experienced anything like this so my question would be this: Was my irregular dosing the reason that I wasn't experiencing these things earlier and will these effects go away after I wean myself off? EDIT: I've had a significantly worse sense of humor over the past month. I know that this sort of thing is common but can lamictal actually make you more serious?

When I start working as an RN I'll probably have the option to work days (7am-7pm) or nights (7pm to 7am). I still don't know which to choose. I know that working nights is generally a bad idea when you have a mental illness because it messes up your circadian rhythm. But days are faster paced and higher stress and I know that high stress is also bad I you have a mental illness. Either way I'm screwed but I really want this job.

Also my current gf has a flat 'no drinking' policy.Anyway after 6 months being on the waiting list at the ONLY place my GP would refer me too I was given a 1 hour assessment and a script for abilify. I have a long LONG history of eating disorders along with the alcohol abuse.

I'm terrified of the weight gain. When I was 16 I was put on seroquel and I blew up like a baloon which STARTED my crippling ED bullshit. I told all this to my psych and he assured me that Abilify was 'completely side effect free' and 'weight neutral' but my pharmacist was flabbergasted and told me I could expect a similar trail to Seroquel?So toss the meds and get a second opinion?

I stuck with it until a year and a half ago and decided being on a fluctuating list of meds(that may or may not work/have ugly side effects) sucked.

They were incredibly restrictive and would only let her out to see me once a month. We got tired of that and started sneaking around to see eachother. During that time we had sex and for LDS culture that is wrong before marriage. Her parents are very strict Mormons and are the type to judge the hell out of you and spread rumors throughout the church.Come 5 months after dating they filed police reports that I was a sexual offender/rapist and needed to be imprisonment for the protection of their daughter. This paper they wrote up was so detailed i wouldn’t be surprised it was in fucking MLA format. It was all based on things she had wrote in her journals which they photocopied as well and attached to the police report. They then destroyed her phone threatened not to let her go to church because I was there This went all through the regional church and suddenly my family and myself were completely ostracized. Incredible restriction went by for the next year and a half. During that time they started using the money in her banking account without her knowledge at all. They didn’t stop until threatened to sue (which under the circumstances I was able to) which they then suddenly had all the money appear again. She was saving for when she turned 18 so we could get her the hell out of there. Which we did.Once she turned 18 she moved in with me we severed contact for months with her parents. They stated her sisters weren’t allowed to come to our apartment because they feared I’d rape them. Blocked anyone that supported us from Facebook and any calling/texting and they went on like nothing happened.Now she has gone a long time without any support besides myself and my parents. We are still active in our church but one very far from where this all happened. She doesn’t feel like she has any support from anyone so she started turning to her parents again. Her mom is incredibly manipulative and has proven herself to be.For the last few months she has been trying to essentially convince me that if I just let it go talk to them and suddenly be happy about it all again everything will be better.I was diagnosed with BPII only two months ago and before that I had to drop out of my double honors meteorology chemistry major program because my depression ruined my GPA lost my scholarships lost my job. Since then I’ve been seeing a therapist twice a month changed all my Meds around and got my grades withdrawn and been recovering.My therapist was appalled to hear this story and thinks I’m completely justified in not wanting to have anything to do with them.

45944,"Looking for insight. My dad has struggled with bipolar since his teens. He's 60 now and I'm 36. I have some trauma from my childhood because of his manic episodes in which he became violent. I can remember at least 3 episodes where he had psychosis. My parents divorced but lived together on and off for years. Apparently my dad's doctor released him and said he was ""cured"" and didn't need any more treatment 10 years ago or so my mom tells me.Well fast forward to this past Thursday my dad had an episode of psychosis following days of mania and there was a lot of alcohol involved. He apparently hallucinated that my mom was screaming at him and being horrible to him and he's hospitalized right now. The police found him wandering the streets at 5am. I saw him Friday morning in the emergency room and he was still babbling on and on rocking back and forth and seemed to be scared of something I think demons possibly from what he was babbling about. Well he was given a shot and moved to the crisis center in the local hospital. I visited him today and finally got him to sign a release stating his doctors can talk to me. But he still believes that my mother was screaming at him and doing horrible things to him which are not true.I let him tell me all of this and my mom was there visiting too. I didn't say much because I needed him to trust me. He thinks there is nothing wrong with him and claims the doctors told him that he is fine and not bipolar at all and they've given him pills to calm him down. My mom said he can't come home and she wants nothing to do with him ever again and all of his care is in my hands now.Mostly I'm just venting here. I want to tell him he was hallucinating but he still isn't well so I'm guessing that's not a great idea. I feel he will come around and realize he was hallucinating but I don't know how bipolar works. I don't know what's going to happen to him now. ",Bipolar

45947,"Drug advice I am 26 and have been diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder after a manic episode that lasted a month and a half. I’ve dealt with it my whole life but never saw a doctor for it. In the beginning I was given an anti depressant and Adderall for ADD. The Wellbutrin (anti depressant) made me horrendously depressed and mixed with Adderall incited violent irrational and unpredictable behavior. I then was prescribed Lamictal for my mood. All three of those sort of mellowed me out. Then I decided to stop Wellbutrin because it made me incredibly forgetful even to the point f frequent black outs and loss of time/days. So now I am currently on Lamictal and a very low dose of Concerta. The concerta is doing nothing. I have horrendous ADD and my memory is pretty much wiped clean every week. I am also extremely EXTREMELY tired mentally and physically every day which is not ok because I am a runner and an avid biker but I haven’t been able to work out in weeks because of this exhaustion.

I told this individual that I take lithium and I suffered from depression and Ocd as a teenager. He asked me if I was worried about taking 'something they use in batteries' and I explained that there are many chemicals that are broadly used and that taking lithium helps me to be the best version of myself. Everyone was kind of awkward and I told them that it wasn't something to worry about and that mental health issues need to be discussed openly.

I went to medical school as a healthy bright 18 year old but within the first year I had my first major depressive episode and suicide attempt. At 19 I had my first manic phase - a month long binge with multiple sexual partners drug use and irrepressible urges to study all night. Spontaneous and irresponsible acts were my forte; I decided that Morocco was my spirit country and whisked myself off the next day. I gained a reputation amongst my friends as mercurial and fun but inside I was imploding; my second suicide attempt followed the month after.In my mind the problem was Medicine. This stressful hypercompetitive environment was obviously causing my mood swings; no way was this an organic health problem. So I left med school at the beginning of 4th year and began teaching Maths - and I was great at it! This career change had solved all of my problems and I was tippety top flying high fantastic! Life couldn't get better right?Wrong. The depression came back harder than ever sending me spiralling down into a deep dark chasm.

I thought I could just ride the wave surfing with the sun on my face when times were good and paddling against the tide when times got bad. I never imagined I'd be dragged under again.But I was.

The long hours the constant need to be 'on' and engaging the marking the data tracking the free time spent planning the expectations the meetings - they slowly pulled me down until I was drowning exhausted from fighting the tide and ready to accept defeat.But three months ago I stopped fighting. I left teaching and I felt the wave pull me up lifting me toward the surface. Each day that I got up was a victory that brought me closer to sunlight. I chose to leave behind the stress that was threatening my survival and anchoring me to the ocean floor and I put myself first.

I'm a 22 y/o Maori male and have been seeing this choice as lady for a coupley months she's 30 and deals with type 1. We just started living together and she has 2 awesome young girls who also seem to posses the ability of growing horns on command. I don't know how to explain that I enjoy playing with fire aware of getting burned. The unpredictable is such a turn on from good vibes present to more energy than a lightning storm. I haven't known her personally for long but majority of her previous relationships with family and partners has been a path of hardship through physical mental and spiritual violence... Due to their lack of understanding/empathy. I'm fortunate to have personal stability and have so much stength to support this beautiful lady plenty of time for her daughters as want to provide them with the guidance and opportunities that I took for granted in whatever they wish to pursue. It's still early days and she's a really independent lady a survivor not a victim so there aren't labels yet as such as she struggles with romantic feelings as much as guys. She doesn't take meds but from previous experience they bring about a numbness. I strongly identify with spirit/natrual alternatives (as a Maori not just crazy) if anyone has any suggestions? At times she goes really queit and you can feel the static in the room I just haven't grasped how to bring her out of this headspace as she is so independent and hasn't had a partner that can support and just listen without anger or wanting to fix everything she keeps quiet. Her thought manifests in the environment and is like static electricity. she seems to resolve issues like a male through self reflection rather than a verbal release. Laughter seems to help so I try change her pattern of thought with humour but the downside being i dont know what's appropriate at times. Last thing I want is to come across as her mother especially since early days but I'm all about the family values and just here for support. To listen rather than reply these ears aren't painted on.

There were no signs specifying which window to go to or even saying ""please ring bell for service"". I must have stood there fidgeting for 3 or 4 minutes before finally knocking on the window lightly (no way was I gonna ring a bell in a quiet office). Then while I was filling out my paperwork they decided to turn on music and it was the Braveheart soundtrack. So I'm sitting there listening to the sountrack to a film where someone gets disembowled and it occurs to me that they can't be THAT stupid and they must have hidden cameras or something to see what their patients do in such an uncomfortable situation. Now two weeks later I'm like ""um you totally thought someone was watching you on a hidden camera"". So since I've never dealt with psychiatry before was that being delusional or is that honestly something plausible?",Bipolar

45984,"ADD Inattentive and BiPolar II ... anyone else? Hi there I am 30 yo female who was diagnosed as ADD Inattentive in Highschool prescribed all those study candies and made it through college (where I began binge drinking and smoking pot)... also had a bout of serious depression and started Lexapro which lasted only about two years . I am very petite and was taking high doses of Vyvanse (70mg) and also Adderall (30mg tab) for studying. I had what I would call my first “episode” in college after smoking a bowl... fast forward to five years out of college and still taking Adderall and vyvanse and ambien gained about 40lbs. I wanted off of that shit so I quit taking it and quit seeing my doc. When I didn’t have any left since I stopped seeing the doc I became addicted to Benadryl (3 at night) just to sleep. Anyway I went on a trip and got some pot candy and I got sick and then I was prescribed a 10 mg prednisone. That’s when the mania started it was full blown mania for about 10 days before I went to the hospital. I don’t remember everything but I was signing everything! I couldn’t stop it was weird. Anyway sorry for the long post my new doc has me on Seraquel 200mg and vistiril along with a bunch of supplements (I am trying to get away from big pharma). My problem is now I am still very distracted due to the inattentive ADD during work I don’t work and I’ll pick at split ends or google stuff that’s irrelevant. My new doc said NO to stimulants and even said I should not drink coffee. He also said I can do pot or alcohol but it is dis-inhibiting so basically watch out. Now I am in a depressed state and I should be happy. My question to others is how do you deal with bipolar and inattentive add? It’s a tough combo but I am trying to take things one day at a time.

45987,"Medication Frustration (Triiger warning- mentions suicide and ED) long I am new here (36 f) and have commented some but this is my first post. I started a little over four years ago to try and find some relief from all the bad things going on in my mind. The only other time I had been to a Dr to help with my ongoing mental issues was when I was 22 and in college. A GP prescribed me Zoloft and up the dosage a couple times and then basically didn't schedule any follow up appointments. I basically went full out party mode and made terrible decisions lacked impulse control and was hyper sexual and engaged in a lot of risky behavior that I am still embarrassed about even today. I eventually stopped taking the zoloft after about a year because my ex found out I was taking it and he said I had no right to be depressed because my life wasn't that bad(he was very emotionally abusive). My father was bipolar and we lost him to suicide and my sister is also bipolar. I had no idea that antidepressants alone could trigger a hypomanic/manic episode in some one with bipolar.I knew that there was always something not right with me I would have terrible bouts of depression. I attempted suicide at 14 luckily it didn't work I just screwed up my stomach and I never told my parents. My family never talked about emotions. I didn't even know my dad was bipolar until after his death. My mom said he never believed it and refused to take medication for bipolar. Fast forward to about four years ago I break down and tell my husband that I can't take it anymore and need help. I never admitted it to him but I had a plan for suicide and it scared the shit out of me. On the outside my life seemed great married to my husband who is amazing and the love of my life we have two healthy kids(I also have an older children from my previous relationship) and I am a stay at home mom (which is something I really wanted). I had extreme anxiety and depression though. I started seeing a therapist who eventually said I needed to see a psychiatrist because I most likely needed meds because my issues were not going to be resolved with therapy alone. I started meds and did an inpatient program for Eating Disorders because I had an existing ED and felt myself falling back into old bad habits in order to deal with my anxiety. The ED treatment was great but my depression and anxiety were still out of control. I told my psychiatrist back my past with zoloft(I was finally realizing my behavior while taking it was probably caused by being on it alone). We tried a few antidepressants and they all made me feel irritable or angry. My Dr then starts adding mood stabilizers and antipsychotics to the mix. I look up more on bipolar disorder and start to think that maybe what's wrong with me especially with my family history. I ask my Dr if she thinks I am bipolar and she says no because I don't have any type of hypomanic/manic episode and says she changed my diagnosis to mood disorder. We try a bunch of different combos either they don't work or the side effects are so bad I can't handle them. All things she is prescribing me is medication for bipolar disorder. After three years she then starts prescribing me things I already tried and didn't work the first time. I got a new Dr. The new Dr asks right away if my old Dr thought I was bipolar after I give her the list of meds I have already tried. I see her a couple times and she says she thinks I am bipolar and my extreme attacks of anxiety that come along with not sleeping and being paranoid and suicidal are episodes of dsyphoric hypomania. I am now on my third med change with this Dr. All together I have been on 30 different meds in a little over 4 years. I am so frustrated. I am always med compliant I really want something to work. I was just on Fetzima and lamotrigine. I am so irritable and can't sleep. So my Dr took me off the Fetzima because she thought it was what was causing me problems I think it might be the lamotrigine. She said it was unlikely but I had the same trouble with Vraylar and Rexulti. I am now on the lamotrigine oxcarbazepine and mitrazapine. It's been a week off Fetzima and I am still extremely irritable and not sleeping well. Sorry about the life story. I am just so frustrated and want something to work but I feel like I am starting to run out of options.",Bipolar

Here is the [link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/87a00b/have_been_taking_lexapro_10mg_for_past_4_days/) on r/depression. **TL;DR** Not sure what type of depressive disorder(PDD Smiling Depression SAD Cyclothymia or Bipolar 2) I have. My psychiatrist started me Lexapro 10mg and based on how it goes he said we could try switching to mood support meds. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. I'm worried I might be in a hypomanic or a manic phase(got told by my psychiatrist that Lexapro elevates the mania and asked me not to take it if I'm in a hypomanic or manic phase).I met my psychiatrist last Thursday and we talked about my depression. I've always had ups and downs in my life for a few years. But I always thought it was because of my actions that caused then and not the other way around. I'm still not sure what type of depressive disorder I have. Since I had like 2 weeks time before my appointment I did a bit of research reading about the depression types and how each of them is different in their own way. So I told my psychiatrist that I wasn't sure if had the persistent depressive disorder seasonal affective depression smiling depression or Cyclothymia(aka bipolar lite).When I was doing my research and if there was something relatable to me or if something similar has happened to me before I noted them down as a list. We talked about how I identified that I was depressed and all the points on the list. Then he told me that even he wasn't sure if I had Dysthymia smiling depression bipolar 2 or cyclothymia. So as a general procedure he said that he is going to prescribe me meds to help with depression and if it doesn't work he is going to prescribe me mood support meds for cyclothymia or bipolar 2. He prescribed Lexapro 10mg to take every morning and asked me to get back to him in 2 weeks about how the meds were working. He also warned me not to take Lexapro if I feel like I have a hypomanic or a manic phase as it might elevate the mania. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like I'm not depressed since yesterday. I was not sure if it's my hypomanic phase and I didn't take my meds today.So these were the differences that I noticed in me yesterday compared to the day before:* I feel fresh more energetic and I feel like I got back my motivation to do things.

45992,"Throwaway can I vent for a moment? I'm currently undiagnosed (getting there.. why does it take so long to see a pysch?) but I had one of those ""oh shit I was so crazy I convinced myself I wasn't crazy"" moments a few months ago after I checked myself into a psychiatric hospital in the middle of the night while going through a month of full blown mania without really realizing what it actually was. I didn't want to get hospitalized so I kinda lied my way out Idk why. I probably shoulda gone but I just wanted to talk to someone and in the moment the idea of a hospital bed was the last thing I wanted. Feels fuckin bad man. I didn't ask for this shit. I really should have seen the signs earlier though. I was such a bright kid and then when I was like 16 I just dropped off the face of the earth. Or when I was 19 and I drank myself into a near coma and flipped my car 3 times and walked away without a scratch or that time I dropped out of college suddenly to become a plumber after sleeping 16 hours a day for months or when I was drinking myself into blackout daily just to cope with the pain. I am so very fortunate to have a wonderful girlfriend that cheers me up when I am down but sometimes she gets upset when im ""away"". Sometime's I'm ice cold. I just check out from the world. Nothing gets in and nothing gets out. It's like an emotional hostage situation. It might be for a day it might be for a week but I'm just gone. I just get so wrapped up in all of my racing thoughts. They kill me. I suffered from some serious childhood abuse so I often flashback into those memories (definitely have a ptsd diagnosis coming as well) and then before I know it it's an hour later and my already shitty mood is just shot to oblivion. I am so. fucking. depressed. I've moved to a new city a year and a half ago and I don't have a single friend in my area besides roommates/girlfriend. Honestly it scares me to talk to anyone I haven't known for years at this point. My desire to engage in friendships is shot. I would honestly rather fuck off in my room and work on my projects all day and night. Sometimes I feel like code is the only thing in this world that makes sense. It just is or it isn't. There's no grey. And that brings me to the next thing...Ever since I realized that there is actually something wrong with my head I have been lower than low. I pride myself in my mind and my work. I refuse to be limited. I just can't accept that for some months of the year (when I'm low) my critical thinking is shot. It makes me feel so fucking useless. And somehow despite all of this I am doing relatively well for myself. So there's that I guess. I do seriously wonder how long I'll be able to keep this up. I just can't really help but feel that there is just no fucking point to anything anymore besides my work. I don't feel as if I could ever possibly achieve happiness so I spend my time working towards some stupid never ending monetary goal. In mania I have a hard time discerning what is real. The one thing that I can understand is that money is the only god and with enough money you can do anything. So I pursue this because it is a constant providing stability above all else. If I could fuck off to some island with my girlfriend and enough books/a working computer I don't think I'd ever come back. I feel different. I'm losing my ability to blend in. I just act.. very eccentric to put it in a good way. And I feel like its becoming noticeable. I guess that's the end of my ramble. I feel embarrassed when I open up like this.

I’m impulsively spending and it’s causing issues in my relationship. I’m not sleeping much. I cut all my hair off yesterday after pulling an all nighter and I’ve been very anxious. I feel pretty shitty about myself and now I’m scared that I’m starting to lose control again. I made a therapy appointment and I talk to my psychiatrist again in a week.. am I manic or am I just over thinking this?",Bipolar

46008,"My job has become too much. What do I do next? I work at a coffee house/bar. I've been in there for almost five years. I've even been told I'm a crucial part of the team and promoted to assistant manager. I like certain parts of my job: restocking getting everything in order before the end of my shift making drinks (coffee &amp; booze) flexible hours (I work 3-4 days a week).For the longest time I also loved the company culture. They seemed to really care. And I love most of my coworkers and they've become close friends. But lately it seems like the company doesn't care at all and besides making me feel undervalued my day to day experience is also incredibly stressful. Management has made this job pretty toxic and I've been super depressed for months (maybe I would've been otherwise but the focus of most of my depressive thoughts has been my shitty work environment).I'm feeling really ready to leave this job but I'm also terrified about what to do next.I don't really like dealing with people all day. I've gotten by this long at my job without losing my shit mostly by being the utility player and spending more effort keeping things running smoothly while other coworkers do more of the small talk that I find so emotionally taxing. But if I can avoid it I'd rather not go into another customer service job.I've considered so many different careers and I've gotten pretty enthralled with each idea for a time &amp; then talked myself out of every one. I've seriously considered nursing social work teaching and making toys/theatrical puppets/art directing sort of deal. I just don't know what I can do that'll give me the time off I need to function while being fulfilling and not emotionally draining. Do you have any advice on selecting jobs/careers? I'm just feeling so overwhelmed by the prospect of making these decisions but I don't feel like I have the luxury to put off these decisions any longer because this job has really gotten to the point of pushing me over the edge.",Bipolar

I feel like I have a twin old life me who had the life I wanted to have. Then it all fell to shit. Then there's current me the remaining other twin who's life is well crap. I mean I'm a loser not being down I just am. The thing that really freaks me out though is when I look back - so much time has passed yet I feel stuck in cement going nowhere. I had suicidal ideation for years bad and that's gone away lately. Which is cool.

For now he gave me some pills for my insomnia he said that it could just be caused by the lack of sleep. A part of me wishes it does but deep down I know it’s more than that.

Trying to keep what I still have in one peice simultaneously.It's not really going well.My thoughts are too scattered to follow. My feelings are overwhelming and fleeting.I'm sick of being sick.

Almost two months ago I finally got my diagnosis after years of instability. Learning to live a different- routined life has been a challenge. I wake up to a handful of medications and see a therapist now weekly. Most of it isn't a big deal. I've known about my mental health for as long as I can I can remember.

I've been cycling between manic episodes which start off fun and then end up making me irritable paranoid and delusional; and then crippling depression where I lie in bed all day feeling like I'm burning in the fiery pits of hell; and each year it seems to get more intense. I can't hold down a job or maintain a relationship for more than a couple weeks. I can't afford to feed myself a lot of the time. After waiting for months I got to see a psychiatrist who discharged me after I told her I had been smoking weed saying I had a substance abuse problem but not addressing the underlying issue which I believe to be bipolar. Luckily I live in New Zealand where we have sweet welfare benefits which are just enough to put a roof over my head. I basically feel like when I kill myself it won't be because I had mental health problems it will be because no one would help me.

46018,"Doubting my BPII Diagnosis Apprehensive About Meds Feeling Like a Fake **TL;DR: I’m afraid that I was never hypomanic in the first place and it was all in my head (“Labelling Theory”) my current medication while effective is dulling my moods/cognition/memory and could be dangerous to keep taking in the long-term if I’m not really bipolar and I don’t know what to do.**I’ll preface this by saying that I’m not seeking medical advice or re-diagnosis just venting and looking for general advice or shared experiences from people who know they have bipolar. I don’t feel comfortable opening up to my therapist about this because she doesn’t believe me and I have a strained/weird relationship with my psych. Apologies in advance for the wall of text.So history. I was initially diagnosed with MDD in late high school (but had recurring episodes since age 13) put on Zoloft and once I titrated up on a higher dose I started to feel restless and hyper to the point where I wondered if those were side effects. So I googled and found out what hypomania was. Even though a lot of the symptoms were similar what I was experiencing wasn’t as harmful or destructive. I also did not experience the two suspected episodes for very long maybe 4-5 days TOPS. In fact I was very productive and somehow ended up doing paid work for this relatively well-known animator/illustrator on the internet that I would’ve otherwise never dared to message out of the blue. So I wasn’t too concerned. It was psychomotor agitation and racing thoughts that made me uncomfortable but those aren’t exclusive to hypomania. Other stuff happened but I don’t want to write a laundry list of symptoms/actions.But then I saw things like “Even if you have the slightest concern it can turn into full-blown mania!! Especially if you have a bipolar relative!!” and my anxiety kicked in. I stopped seeing my psych (for unrelated reasons) and cut off my meds. Then something traumatic happened which triggered a year+ long depression. So I got a new psych that diagnosed me as BP2.However in retrospect I’m wondering if I exaggerated my “hypomanic” symptoms and made myself believe I experienced it after researching it. What if that “euphoria” was really just the happiness from getting out of a depression and accomplishing new things in life? I got second opinions from other professionals who disagree with my psych and suggested ADHD dysthymia or even a vague “personality disorder” (big NO for the latter). So I’m confused.It’s been a year since I’ve been on medication (Lamictal and Klonopin) and I’ve been tracking my moods on Daylio. Aside from good days bad days and occasional day-long “blips” of intense moods it’s so… purple. Neutral. But I’m functioning well! I’m so glad that I have not been suicidal for so long but it feels as though my emotions have been dulled or flattened. Happiness is just mild contentment. Seeing other people cry at a funeral without being able to feel their pain feels so uncomfortable. If I were truly bipolar I would have definitely had at least one hypomanic episode by now but it hasn’t happened. With these meds I also get “brain fog” every once in a while and I feel that my memory is much poorer.I was actually thinking of switching to another psych (I live far from my current one and my mother hates her) so that I can explain my situation and try something different. But if my current medications are working to an extent is it worth it? If I’m not actually bipolar staying on this medication for the long-term might do more harm to my body than good. No matter how you look at it all of this is risky.Does anyone have any personal experience that is similar to this? Thoughts or advice?",Bipolar

I'm diagnosed Bipolar 1 and two years ago I had a pretty severe psychotic episode. I've been on a various cocktail of antipsychotics and other drugs since. I'm not planning on stopping my meds anytime soon if I can help it but I was wondering if the drugs are the only thing keeping me normal. If I for whatever reason couldn't take or get my meds would I revert back to a psychotic state again as soon as the drugs were out of my system or just be more at risk of going psychotic again if something triggered it? ,Bipolar

No one deserves to look at such a disgusting thing. I don't deserve to be alive.Those thoughts are always in the back of my head. Sometimes I'll look at myself and feel confused because I don't understand how I could feel like that. I look normal. Even pretty sometimes. And other times I'll look at myself and cry and scream and vomit because of how hideous I am. I don't understand why I have to hate myself so much. How can my feelings change so much? How can I be okay with who I am one moment and want to die because of how I look the next? I can't even trust my eyes to know how I look. I don't know if I'm pretty and I don't know if I'm hideous. And I can't ask anyone because I know every answer other than ""you're disgusting"" will make me think they're lying to make me feel better.When I see someone look at me I know they're thinking of me.

46026,Lurker realizing I need some help coping/understanding depressive episode relapse. I guess for some preface I was diagnosed last year but have had it all my life. I'm type 1 but was pretty functional as I typically used what I now realize is my mania in school and etc. and pretty much was excelling despite going through manic and depressive episodes (thinking it was normal/teenage angst etc.) until about my 4th year in college when things went down south fast. Fast forward two years a couple of hospital visits and finally getting a full wrap around team I'm a lot more stable now that I'm on what I feel are the right set of meds for me atm (been on a set of lithium lorazepram and buproprion for the past 3 months and it's worked amazingly). It's allowed me to work write and just generally focus like I used to without the mood swings and recognize when I'm becoming manic or depressed at high caliber level that I'm used to. I know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens but recently have had a string of events (good bad and otherwise) have caused my depression to come back in full swing. I recognize it for what it is and why I feel like this which is a huge step compared to before but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where I know just to tune it down. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system but I guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication I think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful.

46031,"Trying to get diagnosed... Also looking for health insurance HiI recently have started on the journey to get some help. And new to this sub. I've been reading but to scared to put myself out there.I don't know if I'm bipolar. I've done a bunch of research and I believe I can trace manic highs and depressed lows as far back as very in early in life... I'm 28 now. The last 4 full ""swings"" as I call them took about 4 and a half to 5 years to run their course. They gotten more pronounced as I started adulthood. This last one landed me a 3 month mania build up with full blown mania for about a month (I wish I could explain this part better... All I can say is that I was not myself and I was pretty delusional about what I could and couldn't accomplish... Sleeping three or four hours every day or two and trying to do everything) and then one of the hardest depressions I've ever experienced for roughly four or five months (suicidal thoughts complete isolation from everyone and everything including work weight gain of about 70 pounds increased self loathing).I'm also a complete fuck up in life. So maybe that's a consideration. This last time the catalyst for my swing was believing I could do a new job and then eventually hiding from it because I couldn't carry some of the tasks out due to anxiety.I guess I wanted to give out some info since I see a lot of you guys share yourselves openly... And maybe vent too.So two days ago was tough. And I've been thinking and thinking about trying to get help but the farthest I've gotten is two therapy sessions with someone I really didn't hit it off with. So after having a shitty wave of self hatred that day I decided to call around again. I found a practice with a therapist and psychiatrist. I went through the process of setting up an appointment to first see the therapist and then the psychiatrist.I don't have health insurance. It's a steep bill but I can pay it. As a side note before I tried the new job I landed myself a decent paying job that is also self employed so I can take days or even weeks off without too many reprocussions. I've done that going on 6 years. It's very difficult to explain but I developed a skill at this job and I could do it the rest of my life if I wanted. But because it is set up the way it is it doesn't give me health insurance retirement or any benefits you might find at other jobs.I figured if I was going to shell out a wad of cash to self pay for trying to get help (and ongoing therapy if it's recommended) I should look at just self paying for insurance.I just don't know where to start so I don't get health insurance sales calls. I didn't even know those existed. I was called almost 20 times in 6-8 hours. Fuck maybe more. And I was trying to work.I don't want to risk ANOTHER set of health insurance salespeople having my information. I just found my state's marketplace? Seems more legit than the 2nd AD on Google.Does anyone have experience or a better starting place? I asked a family member but no one is in this particular situation. And I don't even understand how health insurance works really.I'm in my kinda of even place in the episodes. Truth be told if I hadn't had an exceptionally hard day two days ago and talk to someone about it briefly I probably wouldn't be asking for help. I never really ask for help. But I feel the shit building up against my demons again and I'm so afraid of another swing.I just want of this train. I need a change.",Bipolar

46034,"In high school I was in a manic episode for 2 years In high school I was in a manic episode. In sophomore year during the hypomanic phase I started talking about sex a lot and got in trouble. Two months into my junior year the mania started. I thought I was going to win the lottery and become the president the next MLK or really famous. I even intentionally failed classes because I thought I was going to become the president anyway. I thought everyone in America was going to change the constitution for me while I gave a speech in front of a big audience like MLK did in the civil rights march. I thought I had a special connection to god and god put me here for a special purpose.When I spoke I switched from one topic to another easily. I was very hyper had lots of energy was easily distracted and always wanted to chat. One time when I entered school the security guard once said ""this one is always laughing and smiling"". I went with my mom to buy lottery tickets (they don't sell tickets to minors). I thought I was going to win the lottery and use the money to make myself famous. I used to go to an organization with lots of little offices and I had a plan to buy the building and employ people there to promote my agenda. One time a fortune teller solicited me on the street. I went in and I asked her what college I am going to go to. She answered Harvard. I literally thought I was going to Harvard. I didn't tell my parents most of my plans because I thought they would interfere with them. I was very angry and moody at home.A few days before I turned 18 there was a ""breaking point"" I realized all the stuff I believed weren't true. I was devastated. I wasn't going to become the president or the next MLK. I failed many class. I couldn't sleep at night. I was extremely stressed out. I managed to catch up on my work took summer school and thankfully graduated in the summer on time. A year later I decided to google bipolar and I read the symptoms of a manic episode on WebMD.As I read more about bipolar I learned it's impossible for bipolar I to go undiagnosed. So I wondered how this went on for 2 years without me being diagnosed? During sophomore year CPS was called because I was talking about sex. Then at the end of sophomore year I did the most stupidest thing. I drew 9/11 on a state test. This was a math question about storage bins so I made bin laden jokes. I was laughing but the school wasn't and they took me to a hospital. The hospital just let me go and told me not to do this again. The security pointed out a couple of times I was always laughing and smiling. I saw counselors at school (who are mental health professionals). I wondered if this will happen again but I don't think it will. Well if there's anything worse than bipolar it's severe OCD. I am taking medication for that now. Severe OCD is **HELL**.I most certainly embarrassed myself. In 9th grade I told my classmates I wanted to become a prostitute. I was annoying during my high school years. I didn't think there was anything wrong with me. I thought there was something wrong with everybody else. I guess I am lucky this happened in high school where you are still supported by your parents and not in adulthood where you quit your job and become homeless. Online I realized was safer than offline. When I posted online I used a pseudonym and never used my identity. So if I said I wanted to become a prostitute or something embarrassing online it would not affect my reputation. But if I say I want to become a prostitute to my friends they'll remember it and it will affect your reputation. I actually had former classmates come up to me and say ""remember when you said you wanted to become a prostitute"". I mean I am most definitely not the person I was in HS.We had a teacher with a reputation for being mean and a girl at my school said she's bipolar because one minute she's happy and the next minute she's angry. I literally thought that was the teacher's diagnosis but I didn't know what bipolar was or that I had it. Now I know what bipolar is and realize the girl was using the term colloquially.

46035,Hospitalized for the first time This week I was hospitalized for the first time I had taken benzos and either they mixed with the lamictal poorly or it was a bad source but I was black out for over 12 hours starting and terrified my wife and family. I am embarrassed and ashamed and while black out I talked about many things I'd prefer to have kept hidden including sexual frustrations and a long struggle with substances including LSD to my mother in law calling my father and telling him that I was diagnosed even though I hadn't wanted to do so at this point yet. I spent the next 4 days in extreme depression not eating showering talking or sleeping and am finally feeling normal today. I ate talked with my wife and mother in law today showered and got my hair cut. I am still extremely embarrassed of the things that happened during that day. I don't know what to do or say or how to fix things I did or said. I feel like I hurt my marriage and my relationship with my mother in law I'm scared ,Bipolar
46036,"Rant I Guess. Hello sorry this is my first time actually posting on Reddit so I'm feeling a little nervous but it's all good.I'm a freshman in college and last October I finally saw a psychiatrist after years of struggling and got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 GAD panic disorder and social anxiety. We decided to try lithium and two other anxiety meds. I actually overdosed on the anxiety meds although I was taking the amount I was told and was having a lot of pain for like a few weeks so I wasn't really able to focus in my classes; I got pretty behind and almost left on med leave. I'm now on Gabapentin and got started on Lamotrigine.I guess the lithium was working for a while but lately I have felt like an absolute mess. I will be in what feels like hypomania in the morning and be running around talking a mile a minute everything and then just get hit with depression and withdraw from everyone. Or vice versa. And this sometimes happens multiple times a day. I'm starting to feel crazy and it is taking everything that I have to just barely function nevermind actually having time to do homework or other responsibilities. I don't know what to do with myself. I just feel so terrible. It just feels like I can't achieve any sort of sane moment because if I'm not being affected by my BD my anxiety is at a 10. I just want to be calm and stable. I am just afraid of this starting to affect my family and my boyfriend. He is the most understanding person I have ever met but I feel like eventually he is going to get exhausted with me. I'm not a very happy person and I don't understand why anyone would want to spend time with me.I don't know anyone around here with BD and it is making me feel really alone which is why I guess I decided to make this post. I just feel so crazy I don't know. I'm sorry. ",Bipolar
46037,"Need Advice About My Mom Hello RedditI'm wondering if anyone in this group may be able to shed any advice from experience about a rough journey my family and I have been going through.My mom and I are best friends. We use to talk everyday until she started a few new medications after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Once the medications hit her she no longer talks to me. No longer answers her phone. She is a lifeless walking panic attack which was never the case until medication. Last May my mom went through a traumatic experience with her brother almost being killed in Jail. He truly made a miracle of a recovery but my mom endured a lot of stress from the situation. She went to her psychiatrist who prescribed her Seroquel to help her sleep. It did not help her sleep at all. She went manic in fact. To make a long story short by the beginning of June she had been involuntarily admitted to the local psych ward on 72 hour hold. During those 72 hours they took her off seroquel and the anti-depressant Paxil (Paxil she had been prescribed for almost 20 years due to OCD which had toned down immensely in the past 10 years that she had even had her dosage lowered about 6 years prior to this) and immediately put her on 3mg of Resperidone and 1800mg of Gabapentin. Everything was pretty normal for about 2 months after the new prescriptions then BAM. She was a completely different person. Zombie-like unable to take care of herself a living walking panic attack. It was just awful. Her doctor then only put her on MORE anti-psychotic medications and anti-depressants as well as a benzo. Again making a long story short.. In September I had spoken to her psychiatrist on the phone during one of her appointments who agreed with me we should taper her off of anti-psychotics. Now fast forward and she has officially been of anti-psychotics for 2 months. She is still prescribed Gabapentin mirtazapine and diazepam. She is still in awful shape but has shown signs on being more cognitive in general.I didn't speak with her for over 2 months after Christmas. She didn't want to talk to me or anyone else at that. I saw her right before Christmas (I live in a different state) and told her I would like to be apart of one of her appointments again over the phone and she wouldn't let me. She moved in with her boyfriend after this all started who I feel helps her as much as he hurts her.A few weeks ago. our family dog died. She was 14 but the way it happened was super tragic. I talked with my mom the day it happened and she cried! Which was a great sign to me because 3 months before this she told he she couldn't cry if she wanted to She just had no emotion. So I took this as a great sign! I have noticed she no longer has one worded answers but she can actually respond to the things I'm saying with short responses. So I see very slow improvements. I feel the experience with my dog passing away has opened her up to me a little bit more. I talked with her again about a week after and just tried to have a normal happy conversation about me coming home for a visit in a couple of weeks and she seemed to act half-way normal again. I want to keep this door open and open her trust back up to me again so that maybe she will let me try and help her at the doctors office again one day.. How can I keep this door open? How should I approach my mom about trying to help her again at the doctors when I go home in a couple of weeks? I miss my best friend more than anything and this has been the toughest thing I have ever had to go through. If anyone has any experience dealing with horrible reactions to medications and overcoming this yourself or with a loved one. Any advice would be appreciated.P.S. I probably skipped over a lot of details so please don't hesitate to ask questions!",Bipolar

46040,"My boyfriend is suicidal over Tinitus Hey peeps. I was wondering if any of you have had these same side affects. My bf has Bipolar type one and for a long time he was on ... mirtazopine? He was taking it for years. Back then they said that he was scitzo affect. Last summer he had a manic break I had to hospitalize him and he was finally diagnosed with Bipolar type one. They then took him off that and put him on abilify and Klonopin. The abilify was giving him akathasia so they gave him the klonopin. After a while as all mental health people seem to do is he went off his medication. This apparently by the doc was ok. Since hes type one if he leads a healthy lifestyle he wont get manic again and wouldnt need an anti psychotic. Great. Thats what he wanted anyways. So after a while after being off medications he get a ringing in his ears. Apparently this is a somewhat common side affect. He figured if he could just tough it out his brain would fix itself.He stayed off EVERYTHING for 4 months apart from his blood pressure meds but he finally broke and became upset suicidal and started drinking. He then took a Klonopin and it made the T's go away. Looking into it its a Glutamate inhibitor to level out with his Gaba.This would then make me think ""maybe hes addicted to Klonopin"" but he goes off it for months and then breaks down to take more again. 2mg makes it go away completely and .5 makes in bearable. I feel so lost. He now wants to seek medically asisted euthenasia and refuses to go see the psychiatrist because he thinks they caused his T's.Has anyone else here gone through this?",Bipolar
46041,"Question I’ve been very conflicted the last several days. I started Vraylar 5 days ago and have noticed since that I’ve been feeling small charges of minor anxious energy and even more minor things happening during my sleep. Today I went further and got my usual Hypomania symptoms: warmth/pressure in chest random thoughts forgetting thoughts many ideas but it was still more minor than my last episode and lasted shortly (under an hour). My last episode btw also seemed to include rapid cycling and maybe mixed states. I would cycle between HM normal or depression in one day or under a day and have symptoms of all 3 during HM. The previous episode which was my first a year ago wasn’t like this. Sure I had the energy spikes here and there but it wasn’t nearly as intense in symptoms and I didn’t cycle between depression just crashed into it at the end. (And boooyy that was my worst depressive episode yet).Anyhow after this recent episode I crashed into bad depression with suicidal thoughts then went baseline and have been that way till the last few days. My question is- is the Vraylar causing hypomania or have I progressed into rapid cycling due to my illness being untreated for a year and the meds are helping it which is why it’s so minor? I know this is a lot but damn this is confusing and worrisome ",Bipolar

The other medication helps with serotonin levels but again didn't feel anything.

At one point I recognized my delusions for what they were but the feelings didn't leave. I even had the presence of mind mind to mention inpatient. But I was too scared. So instead of taking it out on my husband verbally I internalized. I have so much self loathing that I felt I deserved to be hurt. To die. I didn't deserve my family. But I couldn't abandon them either. I love them and they should have so much better than me. In the past month or two I stopped taking care of myself. I feel so stressed. I force myself to eat once every other day. I haven't been showering or grooming in a while. Fighting addiction. Not sleeping. Car keeps breaking and I can't keep up with bills.

46050,"Here we go again: EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) in 2016. It was BRUTAL but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up and after an assessment it appears that I’m in need of a “tune up” as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... I’m starting it again today. I hope that it’ll be a little less sucky since I’ve put some hard work into it previously and that it’ll be short-lived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. I’m still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything?

Hi Everyone’s got different skills interests and goals but I was wondering if you could share aspects of your work environment that make a difference for you for better or worse.

Quick background: BP1 Lamictal Welbutrin Benztropine Hydroxyzine.So I have a appointment with my pdoc this afternoon.... and I really feel like I need a med change of some sort. Long story sort I went inpatient last year around July for a full blown psychotic manic episode after taking SSRIs for months and not realizing they were in fact driving me bat shit crazy. They kept me in the hospital for 16 days on a CEC which I think I'd the max without a court order. I went ""home"" slightly less delusional than when I went in still not well by any means. This subsided as time passed and with med compliance. As I came down I was in a mixed state for a while and eventually wound up crashing into what I was hoping was only a depressed episode the only thing is that I have not come out of it for almost a year now. Furthermore at this point it doesn't feel like my depressive lows of the past. I feel more detached from life than ever and I am constantly obsessively plagued by the thought that somehow I will stumble upon some kind of joy that I once understood. I have lost any and all drive that I once had..... Personal Improvement Professional Advancement Sexual Intamacy Intamacy of any kind for that matter it has all been lost somewhere in the past. It feels like when you misplace your keys and need to get out of the house quickly because you are already running behind for an ""important"" event. Every minute that passes while you look for the keys you know you are falling further and further behind and then you start to regret not making an intentional effort to put them where they could be found after you last used them.... but as they say hindsight is 20/20. Finally you look up and realize that even if you did find you keys at this point that you likely wouldn't make it until after the events concludes anyway so what's the point in stressing over it now worry about it tomorrow......

I've been diagnosed with OCD (at 14) ADHD (19) Social Anxiety (19) and Depression (14ish) though I had struggled with all of these since I was a kid but got worse at puberty. I was on Luvox from when I was 14 til 18 (I'm 20 now) just for OCD and it had a moderate effect on that sort of helped with my mood but barely touched my social anxiety but I was stable(ish). Anyways a year ago I went back after stopping the luvox because my symptoms all came back really bad with OCD and my depression and the doc pointed out the other issues too. And I was given a Zoloft prescription but I didn't take it for several months until everything became unbearable. I ended up stopping it after a week though because I think I became a little manic almost when I took it I had barely any sleep full of energy I was talking really fast (which is an achievement when I already talk fast) I felt amazing though my head felt like it was about to explode and then I started to worry that I was going to bite my tongue off (that was OCD) and then I became like scarily numb and I stopped taking it because I was freaking out.Point is the past year my OCD is much better and I have been in therapy for it but my depression has just gotten worse I had an episode at uni and then I dropped out and I got better when I started fixing my social anxiety and met a guy then after I broke up with a guy my depression came back worse than ever and when I was on Luvox I got depressed but these days I have a lot more suicidal thoughts and urges to hurt myself which are becoming more and more frequent so I'm going to ask for some antidepressants when I get my ADHD prescription refilled (she has said several times she wants to prescribe Lexapro but I refused).Anyway I was remembering what happened when I started the zoloft and I had read that when people with diagnosed bipolar take antidepressants it can trigger an episode. My question is is it possible that I do have bipolar and I've just mainly been depressed or can meds trigger that even if you aren't bipolar?

46063,"Could I have Bipolar? I recently went to a psychologist after an ""intervention"" from my family because I had textbook severe depression for a couple months. The psychologist said I had a lot of red flags for bipolar 1. I was sleeping 14 hours a day and taking NyQuil without my parents knowing to stop suicidal thoughts. I would rather be asleep than deal with thoughts. I was skipping school practice and extracurriculars and then failing tests. When I wasn't asleep I was in bed in a dark room just staring at the ceiling. To be all honest though it started before the depression. 6 months ago I was extremely paranoid. I was staying up all hours of the night checking corners and simulating what I would do if someone came into my house to attack me. It got really bad because I was sleep deprived and it devolved from just being paranoid of strangers to my close friends watching their every move to see if they were out to get me like my thoughts were making me believe. Out of nowhere I started dissociating soon there would be 10 minute chunks of time where my brain would just disappear and I didn't know where it went. After this I started to get paranoid delusions where I would believe the alien gods that live in a black hole were going to abduct me because I knew about them. I had a panic attack during my lunch period. At this point I had no idea what was going on I thought I was going crazy but because I even had that thought I knew I wasn't. Now this is where things went really downhill. I woke up one day with the best mood I've ever had. When I was at school everybody thought I was high just because of the way I was acting. I was all spaced out and I talked over everyone. Nothing I said made any sense. No one really thought anything of it though because everybody assumes I smoke weed because of my personality. I was functioning on 120% with less than 2 hours of sleep per night. All of my inhibitions left me at this stage. I started smoking on school property and also selling weed on school property. This is not something I would ever do because I'm a straight A student and I'm top of my class so this has especially a lot of risk. I was also very close to doing cocaine. This lasted for a week and a half. After all of this I came down really hard and this is when my depression started as I explained above. I told all of this to my psychologist and she recommended me to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible because my manic like periods are dangerous. The thing is is I don't was to go to a psychiatrist because then it is more real and I might be too young to even get a mood disorder diagnosis. Oh yeah I forgot to mention I'm 15. I wanted to post this because I am so lost as to what to do. My mother is very concerned because of my depression symptoms and she is pressuring me to go. I'm conflicted. Should I go to the psychiatrist if so should I go asap or should I wait a couple of years?",Bipolar
46064,"Actually losing my mind + new meds **Trigger Warning:** Talk of suicide. Sorry I can't edit the title. Bipolar II here with several anxiety disorders and PPD/PPA for funzies. I've been actively suicidal (but not attempting) and somewhat paranoid lately. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of my 10-month-old son and a volunteer project I don't want to leave unfinished. I should add that I am traditionally very high functioning successful career marriage healthy baby but life circumstances have taken a flamethrower to my world and burned it down to ashes as of late. On a scale of 1-10 my level of stress is at a 13.I came into my psychiatrist's office sobbing Tuesday morning. I didn't tell her everything but I told her as much as I could without her being legally obligated to commit me. My doctor doubled my Lamictal dose added Seroquel for sleep (because I was worried about developing a physical dependency on Klonopin) and added Gabapentin as a spot treatment for anxiety. Last night I took the Seroquel as directed. I woke up this morning and my first thoughts upon waking were that I wanted to kill myself and that I was half hoping that my baby had died in his sleep (in some way that wasn't my fault) so that I could be free of the responsibility of being a mother. I'm sure if I walked into his room and he was actually dead I would lose my goddamn fucking mind. It would be the literal end of me. I have really intense OCD about his safety and intense fears around him dying as a younger infant used to keep me from sleeping. So that was a super strange and disturbing mismatch of thoughts.With that great start to the day I quickly downed the double dose of Lamictal as directed and tried to get on with things. I walked back in the kitchen to my breakfast and half of it was gone and I had no recollection of eating it. I walked around the house for awhile wondering if I had put the pastry down for a minute and forgotten about it. Nope. I did not find the pastry in another room. Almost the exact same thing happened yesterday with a donut. I ate half of a donut on the way to the doctor's office. I thought I had a whole second donut in my bag. When I looked in my bag after the appointment there was only half of a donut left. I thought maybe a homeless person in the grocery store ate half of it and put it back in the pastry case and I didn't notice when I purchased it (it was a sketchy grocery store; it could happen though unlikely). I told myself that was insane and that surely I ate half of the second donut and forgot about it. I tried to tell myself I was being nuts and eat the rest of the damn donut but I ended up spitting it out because I pictured another person's mouth on it. Can stress really cause memory problems like this or am I straight up losing it? Why the fuck do I keep having memory problems only around my breakfast? I am not eating very much at all so maybe it's first thing in the morning blood sugar thing.Around noon with the new drugs in my system instead of wanting to kill myself I just don't see the point of anything. I had a job interview today that went fine. But all professional jobs just seem stupid to me all of a sudden like we are all working on gibberish and acting like it matters. Who the hell cares if we make a new brochure and more people buy a product? I feel like a 15-year-old who just watched Fight Club for the first time and realized capitalism is meaningless. I had some other projects I was working on and I just don't understand the point now. Why would I spend time refinishing a dresser? Seriously why? I can't think of anything more stupid.I also had the thought this morning that I feel like I'm on life support but instead of a breathing machine it's a bunch of pills.Right now I'm thinking about leaving everything right where it is telling my husband he needs to pickup the kid from daycare tonight and just bailing and going to another country until my money runs out. That would fuck up my life and relationships irreversibly. So I might as well kill myself if I'm going that route. Or not. No idea. I guess I wanted to write because I would never ever admit this stuff in real life because it makes me sound like a horrible person who hates my baby and I would never tell another living soul how bad off I really am. can Seroquel make me even more insane? Because that's how I feel. I'm thinking maybe I should just up the Lamictal and see what that does before proceeding with the onslaught of new drugs.**Edited to add:** I am following doctor's orders on the meds. My doctor suggested adding new ones and upping the existing one. I just worry that they are going to make things worse while we sort out the cocktail and I may not have the capacity for things to get worse right now.",Bipolar
46065,"Relapse/Breakthrough Symptoms: What to do? I've been really stable for maybe two years. My treatment plan was on-point. I made a lot of improvements and changes. Then last month I decided to sign up for a volunteer effort that lasted the whole month. It took a lot of time and energy as well as being a deviation from my normal routine.So after it was over I took a week to recoup. Five days in - on a Sunday - I fell apart in the middle of the day with a full blown panic attack and couldn't stop crying for the rest of the day. Ever since that day I've been tired irritable and sad. Little things set me off (like a delay in traffic) and I get so upset over it that I just start sobbing.I really really don't want this to be an episode of depression. I don't want to jump the gun and call my doctor and she changes my meds but I can't afford to isolate myself for weeks hoping to recover. If you've had a similar experience what have you done to cope? Do you have a plan of action that helps you discern what to do? I'll appreciate any input. I just feel so screwed up right now.",Bipolar

I've been spending a lot of time in bed and not leaving the house sleeping a lot suicidal (but not acting on it) basically depressed AF. Anyway my mind recently started having flash backs to stupid decisions and things I've don't while I've been manic.

It feels like my mind is trying to torture me and my body is trying everything it can do to survive. I'm stuck in mental illness purgatory. I've been trying to hang in there.

46071,Near death experience that wasn’t real So I’m bipolar (if that wasn’t obvious from the get-go) and I was coming home from a trip with my Mom on a plane. I had a really amazing weekend and I was feeling happy but not manic but then I started getting very sad for no reason on the way home (just assumed it was another mood swing). Then I had an extremely bad delusion where I was convinced that the plane was going to crash and we were all going to die. I was laying my head on my Mom’s shoulder I told her I loved her and I just silently cried while thinking about how this is the calm before the storm. In my head I was telling myself I can’t believe we’re all about to die and I’M the only one who knows. I actually accepted death and embraced it (not in a suicidal way) in a way that I had never ever done before and it was like I finally felt at peace. I had emotions that I had never come close to. When we experienced turbulence I closed my eyes and thought “this is it this is when it happens” and waited for the screaming and the overhead announcements. I thought of the baby crying and how it never got to experience it’s life and how my mom would never finish her book how my sister would react when she found out her closest family had died. After we landed safely I felt a weird mix of disappointment and relief. I didn’t want to die- but I had expected it to happen so much it felt wrong that it didn’t. After that I got that post-delusion state where everything kind of feels like a dream for awhile. But now I feel like I had a near-death experience that wasn’t real and I’m not sure how to move on from it. I feel like I should’ve gone down with that plane and now life just seems a little off. ,Bipolar
46072,My therapist thinks I may be bipolar. So I just saw a new therapist and I was describing the symptoms I experience. Back when I wasn't on medications I used to have huge highs and devastating lows. During my highs I was more confident than usual my mood was highly elevated I was more energetic and I would be excessively talkative. Every time that happened though I would experience a crash. I would become desperately depressed with suicidal ideation worthlessness etc. With each crash worse than the last. This cycle probably occurred 20 times in a span of about a year. After telling him this he said that it sounds a lot like bipolar. He's a therapist not a doctor so obviously no diagnosis. My doctor put me on Latuda along with my Zoloft and Wellbutrin. One thing I noticed about my high periods is that sometimes I would get a little giddy in the day prior to the high. I also noticed that I still needed a full night's sleep. I just sleep more when in a depression. I've wanted to stop my Zoloft because my depression persists when I'm on it and I really miss the highs I used to have. ,Bipolar

Two days ago I was told by my therapist that I could be diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and recommended meds.I never realised that I might have something like this.

I know since supplements are sort of wishy washy anyway so defnitely not a recommendation but am interested to see what other folks might know for further research. Thanks!",Bipolar

46091,I have bipolar and will begin a post-doctoral fellowship researching my own disease in may! Hi! This is my first post in this sub. I’m super excited to share that I’m going to start studying the genetics of bipolar disorder in a couple of months for my post doc. I just graduated with a PhD in biology studying DNA repair. I’m going to be studying the exact mechanism of how lithium works to make people feel better and also why/whether there is a genetic component to why some people with bipolar attempt suicide and why others don’t. This is all extremely personal for me since I have had bipolar I for 12 years and my wife also has bipolar disorder. Anyway I hope some of you find this interesting/uplifting/cool. Cheers!,Bipolar

46093,"(Brief Mention of Self Harm) How can I help my friend? I apologize if I am posting this in the wrong place please let me know and I’ll move it!I’ve had a friend (M) for quite a few years that suffers from bipolar disorder. M didn’t tell me about it until a good couple years into the friendship; they were in the midst of an episode and I (not knowing what was really going on) regrettably lashed out because I didn’t understand why they had been constantly upset and irritable with me. After that we had a much better understanding and M did a great job of redirecting their anger so I wasn’t getting the brunt of it. However they’ve been under quite a bit of stress lately and although they are not usually directly lashing out at me they’ve taken an emotional turn for the worse. M seems to be in a constant state of negativity always turning every small difference of opinion into an argument and going on angry rants about it. It feels like every time I talk about anything they always have a negative rebuttal. They’ve become very reclusive so we hardly ever go out anymore if I suggest events or concerts or outings they don’t want to go and can only think about why it’d be a bad time. If something goes wrong their night/mood is ruined (for example if they didn’t want pickles on their sandwich and got pickles rather than take them off M just throws it away doesn’t eat and remains livid about the fact they didn’t get to eat and eventually leaves for home early because they’re so upset). Our friend group usually gathers at my place so at this point it’s like I’m trying to tip toe around broken glass in my own home lest I say something to upset them. Lastly the most worrisome thing to me is that they will sometimes joke about how they got so angry they punched their arm/leg/bedroom wall/etc. and the damage is visible. They are currently on medication (from what I’ve witnessed mostly just helps more with the mania) and see a psychiatrist pretty regularly but they don’t see a therapist (though they’ve admitted they could probably benefit from one). I want to be a better friend to them but I myself struggle with depression and it makes that difficult at times. I guess I’m asking for advice because I don’t know how to approach a conversation about this behavior. My worst fear is that M will misunderstand my intentions. They are my best friend and I’d do anything for them but the friendship is starting to take a mental toll on me as well. ",Bipolar

Since late middle school I’ve felt depressive moods/ cut myself for 3years started partying doing drugs and drinking at a really young age and got pretty promiscuous. I never thought I was depressed because sometimes I’d feel really happy and I was capable of that. I thought I was schizophrenic because sometimes I feel delusional or lately I’ve started kind of seeing things or just being extremely terrified of seeing things. I even started to hear my dog choke the other day and when I yelled about it to my sister she said she heard nothing. I just learned that people who are bipolar have delusions and hallucinations so that part makes sense. I don’t do drugs or cut myself anymore and after those things I tried really hard to clean up my act and managed to do very good in school and still am but I have absolutely no motivation and I get distracted SO EASILY like not even adderall will help me (again I thought I had adhd but found out this is also a symptom of being bipolar). My mom will sometimes call me “squirrel” because I’ll talk so fast and leap from topic to topic but other times I can’t even talk to anyone because I get so irritated. I also have weird sleep patterns I can’t go to bed even when I’m tired and I feel the need to sleep for an incredibly long time most of the time. I also just hate myself I hate how I look so much despite constantly being praised for what I look like and whT I achieve. I don’t know if I’m just being paranoid or If I have general anxiety disorder or if I’m bipolar... I’m scared to reach out snd get help I don’t know how. I get so hysterical and I cry so easily and I am so incredibly anxious. My family doctor is an asshole and my family would completely destroy me if they found out I was getting therapy (when they were alerted by my teacher who found out I was cutting myself my mom was sad for about a minute) and to this day 5-6yrs since they found out my dad will stay make fun of me for being “depressed” about “nothing” and cutting myself. None of them understand mental illness or why anyone with privilege would be mentally ill (because they grew up in communist poland and had to escape and they were “fine”) so I just feel stuck but I hate feeling like this I dont know what to do.

I take it with 30mg lexapro which i've taken for several years with no weight gain at all.I am naturally very thin and always have been under weight. I have never had to worry about my weight...until now being on an AAP. I don't even own a scale and borrowed my roommate's today to find out my weight today and last week. The day I began the meds 7 days ago I was 117lbs and am now 124.5. I am still within the healthy benchmark for my height at 5'6. However given that it's only been a week and its 7 pounds that's a lot isn't it? I am excited to be a bit curvier and filled out but I worry about how unhealthy this rapid increase could be as diabetes runs in my family and I worry this medication will affect my health and metabolism negatively.This now is the ultimate incentive to exercise (as i was infrequent) and eat few calories/carbs than before. I used to be someone who could eat anything and be rail thin. I'm hoping the effects of Abilify will out weigh the bad. I found that on day 5 of taking it which was this Monday was the first day I really felt like it was beginning to make me feel better. So far I find myself in a happier mood and my coworkers today told me I seem happier and asked me if something good or different happened. I didn't have an answer!

In fact it never occurred to me to think that our relationship which would be going so well for months and the would have a sudden two week period of intensely angry fights was the result of bipolar disorder. We had broken up about 4 times in 3 years always for just a few days but this time I was tired of fighting his moods. On our last day together while doing a last sweep after packing up our apartment he casually mentioned that his mum ""is manic."" He had never told me that before.I was really caught off guard by the breakup we had just gone to a romantic dinner the night before and his temper seemed out of nowhere so after giving him a few days to 'cool off' tried to fix it and that's when I found out about his new girlfriend. He was screwing her in the bed that We were still sharing at night Awful.Since we split I found out he's cycled through that girlfriend and now has 3 casual ones. He's bought a car a new computer 2 TVs. This despite being really tight on money generally and having a bunch of new expenses since we're not splitting them anymore I can't think of how he could possibly be affording this besides maxing out credit cards. He's deleted all his social media sent angry ranting texts to his friends cutting off their friendship. Right before the breakup he applied for a bunch of jobs in exotic places (he's normally sort of boring about where he'll go) and was coming up with two totally separate out-of-nowhere plans to start businesses in fields he's not skilled in. Now I'm wondering if he could be undiagnosed bipolar. It might explain the sudden promiscuity reckless spending maybe even the bursts of anger out of nowhere We're in our mid 30s so it would be late to be diagnosed.Now that I have this thought in my head I'm obsessed with the idea that maybe he is sick rather than cruel and that he might come down from his mania and want to reconcile. I could forgive everything with a genuine apology and obviously a promise to seek treatment. It's been about 3 months since we broke it off. We split our stuff moved to seperate places and after getting sick of getting angry texts out of he blue I blocked his number. I'm not going to contact him he'd have to come to me.

I felt unsafe angry and wiped from the medication so I stopped taking it. I quit going to appointments and eventually they billed me for all of my no-shows and never followed up.For months after I went off my meds I experienced suicidal thoughts extreme depressive thoughts and began self harming. This was very out of character for me. But I stayed off my mess out of fear of regressing. I somewhat leveled out.I have a family history of bipolar disorder and I’m getting close to graduating. I’ve been feeling very much unlike myself lately and I’m (and my boyfriend is) noticing rapid mood changed from manic (cleaning the ENTIRE house instigating fights eating constantly which I’m not sure is exactly manic but I can’t regulate it and rapid thoughts) to depressive (laying in bed and threatening to never get out crying before every shift at work because I’m just so tired feeling like I’m making no progress and just feeling small).

I shower regularly do all my work and meditate before sleeping. I have much better impulse control and I am much calmer. I don't feel fazed by anything anxiety fear sadness even my usual depression. Other things I have been doing the one I find slightly disturbing is I made a list of all the people I have ever known.Each day I write out what they have done to make me hate them and I conclude that they are worthless to me. So far I have done 10 people and I no longer feel the slightest bit of attachment. When I write out the thoughts it feels like someone is telling me these.When I hesitate he mocks me and laughs about my weakness and tells me the truth. Although the truth is painful to swallow it feels like he is my darker self and he is gradually taking control.He has had his moments throughout my life where he took complete control and caused havoc without any mind to the consequences. When I was younger he would make me steal money and cause my parents stress.But as I grew older he grew calmer and more scheming. To the extent where he never consciously manifested and took control but rather suggested to me what seemed to be rational decisions. But as of late he seems ambitious since I am dealing with very traumatic repressed memories. He appeared smirking in my mirror mocking me he appeared in my dreams hunting me down. He corned me in every part of my life slowly breaking me.Hahaha I can feel him right now slowly killing me. I wonder how much longer I have left until I am nothing more than a calloused unemotional monster. When my best friend told me I was fake it deeply disturbed me. What the hell is going on with me?",Bipolar

46126,"Increased armodafinil and hypomania?? So I’ve been on nuvigil/armodafinil for almost four years now for hypersomnia. I have been at the 150mg dosage for 3 of those years and just recently wanted to go up to 200 to see what it is like. Note: bipolar symptoms started 2 years after I started taking nuvigil and the medicine didn’t seem to affect my mood. I have been on the new nuvigil dosage for a week and a half now and have noticed in the past few days that I feel on top of the world and great. This was not how I felt initially but today I woke up before I even took it and felt super happy and irritated like hypomania before I even took the medicine. Is it possible for a 50 mg increase to trigger hypomania or am I just adjusting to the new dosage? I’m curious because I have never had mood symptoms as a result of the medicine before. Also online it says that nuvigil doesn’t tend to cause hypomania but I just don’t know.Thanks!",Bipolar

But then whenever I’m not on this high I’m so sad and bitter and lonely all the time. I don’t wanna talk to anyone or go on social media or get out of my bed.

I do take vyvanse for ADHD which it really affects my mood when I am not on it but even when I’m on it now it doesn’t make me happy like it used to.

The physio helped some but I'm noticing other muscles are hurting a lot every day. My right arm will get numbness a fair amount and extreme pain. I'll also have random areas (eg.

I need to read more write more be around people more which means quitting my usually very isolating job in order to gain material for my screenplay. I even went as far as to drive 30 minutes to to look for a homeless man that I met two weeks prior outside a bar because I had an interesting conversation with him about Arthur C Clarke . And as far as my screenplay goes I’m obsessed I think about it constantly but I can’t think of a plot or characters or setting my mind just goes around in circles and runs into walls but it’s very important that I get it done.

46143,Best friend needs me and I’m not there (long post) My best friend recently moved to a new city and doesn’t know anyone. It’s ruining his mental health and I’ve been getting midnight and 1 am texts and calls from him. My boyfriend doesn’t understand that there is nothing going on and he needs someone to be there for him. I understand he doesn’t want me talking to other guys at that hour but I’m so conflicted on helping a friend or making my boyfriend happy. No matter what I do it’s the wrong decision. When I drink and fall asleep my boyfriend will wake me up saying I got a call or text and I will be in such a confused state I will state a ridiculous lie that doesn’t even make sense. I don’t even realize what I’ve said until he starts yelling at me that I just lied to him. Last night my best friend called me twice and my boyfriend tried to wake me up and I told him some recruiter called me. It’s so outrageous and I don’t even remember saying it. This led to another fight about me lying and our relationship being put on the line. I can’t keep fighting and being the bad guy that’s ruining our relationship. No matter what I am always the one at fault. I don’t think I can survive another fight with him threatening our relationship only to wake up and get told that he still wants this. Last night I got multiple texts and calls from my best friend begging for me to talk to him and he needs someone there. My boyfriend grabbed the iPad and FaceTimed him and told him to stop calling me and hung up. I was a wreck crying my heart out in our bedroom. I wanted to lock myself in the closet and call my friend and be there for him but we were in the middle of battling out whether I’m lying or he wants this and how I was the one who needed to fix it. I woke up this morning and had a text from my friend telling me he had been cutting himself all night thanks to me. Why do I tell people I’ll be there for them when clearly I can’t keep the promise? I’ve let yet another close friend down. I can’t keep letting people get close to me. I ruin every relationship I’ve formed with people because I can’t keep my own life in check. I feel like the scum of the earth who doesn’t deserve a damn thing. I want to make everyone happy at what ever cost and don’t think about the reality of it.

46145,"bipolar &amp; traveling &amp; manic episodes &amp; foreign psych ward !! Hi everyone. I wrote this about something I experienced last night/kind of what happened to me in my first psychotic manic episode or whatever you wanna call it. Did anyone else ever experience something like this? The sun was setting in the Guatemalan Western Highlands as I used some of my precious battery life to check how far I was on the map on my phone. Nearly three hours. Traffic had slowed to a crawl and I felt the tell-tale ticking of my anxiety rising in my stomach. This wasn’t the plan my brain told me. It was supposed to still be light when you got there. Fear began to overwhelm me even though I had been in situations like this before. I had arrived only the night earlier in Guatemala City close to midnight. It’s days like this my recent diagnosis as being bipolar began to make sense. I thought I heard the woman with her child talking on the phone on the bus saying something about “rubia” and fright overwhelmed me. I have become so scared of my own brain. In everything I do I question – what symptom of bipolarity is this? While in Croatia last summer I was relaxed partying and feeling like for once I had come out of my shell; I had become the person I was supposed to be. That bout of mania landed me in a Croatian psych ward. When I stopped punishing myself for the sexual assault I suffered when I was four and began to allow myself to be happy or so I thought I had a psychotic break. I heard people talking about me. First it was about how great I was how cool how pretty and it was flattering. I felt on top of the world. Then I heard the other hallucinations. They were not so flattering. I spent a night in a hostel crying while nearly 10 people in the same room tried to sleep. I felt terrible but I couldn’t stop crying. I was hysterical. My hallucinations had made me believe I had been raped I had herpes I was tainted and disgusting and that I should probably kill myself because no one loved or cared about me. That night I spent in my head. I didn’t sleep except for an hour but then I was woken up by the hostel staff and asked to leave – my reservation was only for one night. I wandered around the city and I felt like everyone was talking about me. I wanted to cry or sleep or escape but I just didn’t have the mental capacity to do any of it. I muttered and wandered. I felt so foggy like there was a weight on my mind. Why were people following me? Why couldn’t I see them? The next two days are kind of blurs in my mind but I know I managed to leave all my belongings behind including my glasses and my ability to see have a delusion that I could speak every language I had ever heard a word of and start to become aggressive. The next clear memory I have I was waking up in a soft warm bed. It was dirty all around me and I felt so groggy and tired. I was in and out of sleep the whole day waking up occasionally to eat a meal. There was a layer of grime and shame on me that a cold shower couldn’t get off. All I wanted to do was curl up in that bed and become an invalid. The delusions were still there but weaker.So when this perfectly friendly normal Guatemalan woman was simply having a conversation with her mother and I thought I heard words that might pertain to me it freaked me out. I have a mantra I internalize when I am projecting my fears onto speech around me – no one cares about you no one is talking about you. It sounds pretty emo. But when I thought just for two minutes this Guatemalan woman was planning a way to rob me it’s extremely comforting. I went home after I ended up in the psych ward because clearly I needed to meet with psychiatrists and a whole host of doctors and a lovely therapist who would try to help me and have varying levels of success. Throughout this process my goal was to continue to travel by myself. I saw this as a hiccup. A pretty major hiccup but one that’s able to be overcome with a can-do attitude! It wasn’t about or feeling like I had failed but an urging from deep in my motherfucking soul that told me if I stayed in the relative warmth and comfort of my parents’ house now I would never leave. That’s probably a symptom. ",Bipolar
46146,"Mania-like episode how do I bring this up to my psychiatrist? So I have not been dx'd with bipolar. I do have the following formal diagnoses as of now: borderline personality disorder (BPD) double depression (major depression and dysthymia) generalized anxiety bulimia alcohol abuse.I'm trying to figure out how to present this to my psychiatrist. I think I've been in a manic episode for the last 2-3 weeks or so especially. I had started thinking this on Saturday and my significant other said he thought I seemed like I was manic for the last few weeks.My psych doc put me on 20 mg of prozac which I initially thought was making me really zombie like but then I went on a tinder spree. I have promiscuous tendencies when drinking but I usually don't actually do anything. I hit on an old boyfriend once but otherwise have been faithful to my SO.In the past month I have had sex with 3 different guys and had a multi hookup with one that I've basically been texting nonstop. I've been pounding energy drinks and alcohol and tindering and wanting to go out and do things and talk to people and dance which is weird for me because I'm introverted. My SO confronted me Friday night/Saturday and everything kind of crashed back and I'm having a what the fuck did I do moment.I felt GOOD last week. I actually felt like I had some energy despite still not sleeping any better than usual (I have bad insomnia). That never happens and I want to cry because if it is actually bipolar I'm not going to get to feel like that again. My psychiatrist thinks my baseline is a depressed mood (which I'm now in again). So basically I get to spend the rest of my life depressed and I don't want to have to live like that.How do I bring this up to my doctor? I have been drinking a lot so I'm worried she is going to dismiss it as a by product of that instead of something else. I've taken mood stabilizers in the past without much improvement in the depression but the focus was on the depression.

Throwaway account cause i don't really use reddit i just needed some adviceI was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a month ago and started taking latuda about 20 days ago.

I also noticed some but not all depressive feelings being held at bay which was nice if not quite optimal.However I bumped up to 30mg about a week ago and 2 days after that I had a psychotic episode until the next morning-I felt incredibly debilitating dissociative symptoms and I felt like my body was acting seperately from my mind in a way that was trying to kill me. I couldnt really talk and mentally I felt completely void and couldnt form a coherent thought.

Since I have bp2 mania with that much cognitive and physical impairment isn't really normal for me.Anyways after that experience my psychiatrist recommended that I cut back to 20mg latuda (which seemed to help with hypomania to some degree) until the end of the college semester and we planned to experiment with med cocktails after the summer. With all this in mind I'd like to have some sort of plan going forward. Is there a safe way I can continue to ramp up my latuda dose (i.e. in conjunction with a stronger antimanic agent like lithium)? Or should I quit latuda and try a different drug entirely?",Bipolar

46155,"There's no amount of meds I can take that will properly medicate my overwhelming generalized anxiety without screwing everything else up It just feels cosmically unfair that the fact that I need to take multiple mood stabilizers seems to mean the balance is such that it's impossible for SSRIs to lessen very much of my anxiety. I've been seeing my pdoc for years and she's great and I trust her and we spent two years figuring out the formula for my comorbid cocktail. Before I was diagnosed bipolar obvs life was miserable but I was able to take a higher dosage of the SSRI I still take (Lexapro) and maybe I'm remembering with rose colored shades but I feel like back then while my life may have been spiraling out of control the anxiety wasn't quite so paralyzing. We've tried multiple times to increase the Lexapro but every time I become catatonically emotionless within the week so I know at least for Lexapro that's not a viable option.My pdoc seems to think that the anxiety is more situational than chemical but I can't help but feel this isn't a normal (or completely unmedicateable) level of crippling anxiety to feel constantly. At the same time this isn't an ideal point in my life to go gambling with switching up my meds again. Is it really just impossible for some of us to find chemical relief from anxiety in a way that won't throw off the balance of the mood stabilizers? I know I should pursue DBT or CBT but $ makes that really difficult right now when I already pay my pdoc out of pocket and am broke as a joke. Is it pessimistic or deluded to think there's no way something other than medication could treat my anxiety the way meds did in the past? I know therapy could help with depression and such but what of the every-second-of-everyday anxiety that is definitely not entirely situational and has not improved with changing situational circumstances? If the anxiety was caused by something specific I might be more optimistic about CBT/DBT but it's just... generalized. It doesn't go away.I feel my options are a. try another drug and start over so to speak or b. accept that this is my lot in life as a bipolar person.",Bipolar

46160,"Hey I’m new here! I just wanted to ask some questions. Does anyone go through the whole ‘range’ within a few weeks? Ie a (I presume) brief period of hypo/mania to the depressive stage to anxious to eventually ‘normal’ to then swing back round to it all? I’m in denial and don’t want anything to be wrong. I’ve had from what I remember in the past two massive depressive periods - the childhood one I can’t remember too much about it. The last one I was physically ill with it. My mil likes to remind me of how my body was ‘here’ I most definitely was not. Any manic episodes I have managed to keep myself in check but this is I presume the anxiety’s doing. I have an irrational fear of repercussions (that and a poor credit rating) and normally contain it to getting new pets or some other thing that is a huge distraction. If I had access to money I dread to think. Drinking I can go where I literally want to drink ALL the time to never wanting to touch it I also get suicidal after drinking (a bit like how you feel after a manic episode where you just think what a d**k you’ve made of yourself and the shame over what you’ve done well what you remember anyway) I still don’t know a lot about this illness (only recently been referred) I see the mental health team every week but I kept fobbing them off when bipolar was mentioned ‘I’m not bipolar!’ And for anyone from the UK we pretty much only have Stacey from eastenders as point of reference *facepalm* . I never act out on suicidal thoughts (health anxiety there too).Also does anyone ‘forget’ a lot? Eg I literally washed and changed my daughter (she’s 1 1/2) and literally 5 mins after I couldn’t remember what all I did.. did I change her nappy? Did I wash her? Did I brush her hair (for that one I can see her hair has been brushed but I can remember doing it) I forget if I have eaten went to the toilet. Work I struggle so much. I get anxious over it I can’t face them when I go back after being off sick. The looks I’m given the questions as to why I was off and if I’m feeling better (all in good heart) but I get so ashamed I can’t manage. I struggle to get up and ready to go in. When I’m there I struggle with deadlines and adherence - everything is timed. I accidentally got a new job in a completely different sector where I’m looking after people with dementia. How Can I actually look after people when I can barely manage to look after myself? I’m treading water and poorly. I’ve four kids (the elder three are teens) and they’ve to help me so much as my partner. I’m terrified of another massive depressive episode as before as I CANNOT spend another year or more ‘not here’ I struggle talking to doctors about this so will be glad when I finally meet the clinical psychologist who’s been assigned to me.Also cbt doesn’t seem to work anymore :( i can’t take hold of my thoughts which in turn make dealing with them impossible..Whoops sorry for the dissertation here!

I get recurring fevers once a month around 101-104 degrees they last 2 weeks and my only symptoms are cold sweats chills and really awful flu-like aches. This condition leaves me housebound half of my life because its like having the flu constantly. I have done extensive testing for this through a rheumatologist.My periodic fever syndrome started after starting lamictal 3.5 years ago. It started exactly a month in as I titrated up the dose. I am 99.9% sure it's tied to the medication and my rheumatologist thinks that's very likely. I've had 6 attempts of getting off lamictal and I absolutely cant and possibly never will be able to get off of it so I'm stuck. It helps me too much so I end up suicidal lowering my dose. Rheumatologist started treating me for the fever syndrome anyway in case treating the inflammation would help but I've only had a slight reduction in symptoms. Psychiatrist says there's really nothing else for me to switch to with my history of everything I've tried and it's down to either getting off or finding a way to treat my fevers. (I take lithium as well but it doesn't help depression like lamictal does)Apparently 5% of people who take lamictal have periodic fevers as a symptom and even lamictal-induced lupus is a thing which is terrifying.

I’ve tried to read through the subreddit and the internet to find other stories that relate to me but I can’t seem to find it. So here it goes!Background: I’m a 20 year old male college student diagnosed with MDD in Feb 2017 which transformed to a Bipolar2 diagnosis in Nov 2017. I’ve been on Lithium and Wellbutrin adjusting dosages according to my psychiatrist. However things got rough ever since October since my insurance ran out so I haven’t been taking a steady dose of Lithium since (dw my insurance is now reinstated and I can’t wait to be stable wooo!)Sorry had to get that aside. So sometimes when I notice myself being either depressed hypomania or in a mixed state I can’t help but doubt my perspective on life. Sometimes my views on religion family self-worth body positivity and other thoughts change so frequently that I can’t tell if it’s my bipolar influencing my thoughts or if I’m experiencing life changes.I’ve been doubting and question my religion (islam btw) sometimes feeling so distant. And then all of a sudden I’ll enjoy praying and I feel so connected to God. Imagine a twist on a perspective like this but also to weed alcohol body image etc. That’s been happening quite a bit.A question for you all: have you guys ever questioned your perspective on life and doubt it being an effect of Bipolar? Sometimes I don’t know if this is who I am NOW or if it’ll change in a few days/weeks. It really makes it hard for me to be grounded in my beliefs and have a steady outlook on life. I always think my values on life are changing because I’m growing as an individual but what if it’s Bipolar? I would really appreciate it if I could hear any similar stories updates or comments where anyone could relate to this feeling. Sometimes I feel so lost because I’m sick of analyzing my thoughts and feelings 24/7 and comparing it to my previous feelings “x days or weeks ago” and finally trying to see where and who I am today.TL;DR — Bipolar 2 20 year old college guy trying to figure out if these different perspectives on life I’m having are due to bipolar or are natural?

So what does stable mean to me?S: Sleep. 8-10 hours one hour without electronics in bed by 10:30 out of bed by 7:30 T: Therapy.

46185,"Happy New Year! Here's my Resolution I want to notice the times when I am alright. Really notice them stop to think ""hey my mood is okay right now I'm not anxious and I'm safe."" Taking a moment to just feel my body and appreciate my surroundings. This has been so helpful to me lately. I'm climbing out of a small depression caused by a medication problem (lithium level got a bit low while tapering off another med). I'm also kind of stressed out by some life stuff outside of my control it's not terrible more just annoying but I don't like it. I kind of have to realize something always comes up. There are no perfect stretches of time where work isn't stressful a social situation isn't stressful etc. But I have a roof over my head food in my pantry and love ones around me. **I want to notice that it's okay right now.**There are three times when a potentially bad thing can hurt you. You can get anxious before it happens (if it happens). You can have it happen. And then you can ruminate and dwell on it. I know I can't always control what happens to me but I do want to get better at reducing anxiety and rumination. When I think back on events I want to tell myself a story that is neutral not one that makes it worse. I don't want to invent problems or spin existing problems out of control. It's hard but these two things are my mental health resolutions for 2019. **I want to appreciate the good moments and I want to do my best to ensure that bad ones only hurt me once.**Disclaimer - I'm talking about my own anxiety and rumination over small problems this isn't meant to dismiss traumatic events that you will naturally feel a lot of anxiety around and ruminate about. Terrible and traumatic things happen. This is more about not spending the entire day worrying about something inconsequential. ",Bipolar

Then a few months later when depression kicks in they become the most annoying disgusting person. I'm aware it's the illness and it will pass but once those thoughts are formed the magic of the relationship is gone and I'm back to believing that I'm better off alone. It's too much work to push through the depressive period trying to make myself feel better and get out of the mood but also to convince my partner that it's all ok and I still like them. I simply want to be alone when I am depressed and it's annoying and a huge turn off to have to validate a partner when I am fighting tooth and nail not to jump off a bridge from the depression.

Are psychiatrists available for in-home care or diagnosis? How can she get help when she refuses to believe that she has a problem?

She thinks her small behaviors put peoples lives at risk.

I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 8 months but lord knows ive been bipolar all my life. I have 2 addictions they are video games and weed. They basically run my life. I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted they're functioning adults even though they smoke and/or play video games. Some thoughts on this; What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle you need help mentally like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something ""cool"" and ""fun"" so either way you go to your addiction your life force what keeps you here. Then because of this and through this you're addicted to something.&amp;#x200B;But like so what? I'm just speaking out loud here but I love my addictions. I don't want to quit them. I play league of legends and smoke weed. I love doing it. Am I really happy while doing those two things? Deep down I know the answer is ""not really"" BUT AT LEAST I am not drowning in despair. My addictions keep me from going over the deep end they are what make life ""okay"". Isn't it acceptable to use these things for my own benefit? &amp;#x200B;However this brings me to my next thought. Do I over-use them? I play league for like 7 hours a day on average. I smoke CONSTANTLY. I'm high right now as I type this. At work. Was late because I woke and toked played League for 2 hours THEN came to work. My boss isn't happy with me. My addictions are a hindrance to my life as you can see. &amp;#x200B;Are video games and weed ruining my life? Probably. Will I regret it someday? I already do and will probably continue to further regret they're use as I get older. But they're also saving me.Therefore I like any other addict out there don't know what to do. If I decide to quit. Will life be bleak and dull or will it refill itself with other things? Will I just find a new addiction? I heard it's impossible to ""quit"" addictions one has to REPLACE addictions. When I am drowning in bipolar which is often what do I use as a crutch instead of my addictions. I use video and games to ESCAPE! I escape from reality all the time because it is so vicious for me because I am bipolar. I see the world as hell everything is horrible because I am depressed. When I am in this place and I need to run away and can't use my addictions anymore what do I do? That is the time when I would relapse not knowing what to do but needing something to help me escape my problems. What about quitting addictions would improve my life?I look at this as a cost/benefit ratio question. Simply put; is the cost of quitting my addictions worth all the work it will be? I will be missing out 100% on the things that I ""love"" being League of Legends and marijuana and I will have to put in a lot of work finding new things to spend my life doing. And I probably wont find them as much fun as my addictions! Fuck that man why the hell should I quit? What makes it worth it? I can't find an answer man. ",Bipolar

46209,How FMT cured my Bipolar 1 Disorder (fecal microbiota transplant) Hi all. I experimented with home FMT under the guidance of my excellent psychiatrist. It was a phenomenal success. After 18 years of hell: continuous unrelenting and completely debilitating depression interdispersed with frequent psychotic/ manic episodes. I had been hospitalised over a dozen times and had extremely low functionality. Then in November 2016 I started home FMT. No improvement for 3 months then I experienced an exponential decrease in all my symptoms. Within 6 months I was 100% symptom free and was so well my psychiatrist agreed to take me off all medication. That was 14 months ago and I'm still 100% symptom free. No depression in any level for 19 months no mania for 14 months. My intense anxiety and social phobia has completely disappeared. My stress tolerance is still increasing. I am now a highly functioning completely well person. It was miraculous. There is currently a clinical trial underway in Canada headed by Dr Valerie Taylor of the Womens College Hospital trialling FMT for bipolar depression. My psychiatrist is soon to write my case study up in the Australian New Zealand journal of psychiatry and ill soon be featured in a feature length documentary. Here is a link to my story on Australian National TV. since then (June 2017) I've also been able to lose 18kgs. The weight was a side effect of the anti psychotics I was on which I am gratefully no longer on.

Since November I have spent almost every moment outside of class and work in my room. I stopped reaching out to friends and would just lay in my bed trying to drown my life out with movies. I’d go to bed at 7pm every night and just wake up early just so I had more time awake to lay in bed and do nothing. I was doing great at work and finished my semester strong but it took the life out of me basically. New Years Eve I finally decided to go out with friends after not drinking since October. (I wasn’t drinking on purpose because of my depressed mood). I didn’t over do it but I was definitely drunk and didn’t get home til 4am. The next morning I woke up around 11 and it was like a switch was flipped. Instead of wanting to be sedentary in my room all day I suddenly couldn’t sit still and had motivation and energy. That night I couldn’t get to sleep until after 3am and had racing thoughts all night. I didn’t feel terrible though thankfully just restless. This isn’t my first rodeo so I picked up the signs that I’m going into an up swing and notified my doctor and preemptively took an extra dose of my antipsychotic (I’m allowed to add doses as needed) and took a small dose of Ativan (.25mg). Today i haven’t taken any extra doses but man do I feel incredible. Not out of control though by any means. I won’t let it get that far.

Read up on bipolar and really identified/ understood why she would recommend me to the psychiatrist assuming she thought I could have bipolar. Met with the psychiatrist and not to my surprise she said she was sure I was bipolar. However she wanted me to get bloodwork before starting me on lithium to see my levels in various things. She said she was going to diagnose me official with unspecified mood disorder until she saw my results regarding my thyroid. I was pretty bummed hearing this news she essentially told me I had bipolar disorder but lacked whether it was I or II so I still felt lost but like I was on the right track.Well my blood work came back and everything was normal except I had extremely low vitamin D and B-12. My psychiatrist called me and gave me dosage for otc vitamins. I read into the situation wrong and assumed she was just reducing my issues down to deficiencies.I know these two deficiencies do not explain mania. Maybe vitamin D explains psychosis but I don’t experience this. I felt like everyone was so sure I was bipolar and led me on to thinking I had a solution and I think this issue runs deeper than just supplements.I know many mental illnesses have links to vitamin deficiencies and I guess my confusion comes from whether or not anyone else experienced this along with being bipolar. I have an appointment on Thursday first one since bloodwork and was wondering if I should mention the bipolar diagnosis if she doesn’t.TLDR; is my doctor reducing her diagnosis to needing vitamin d and b-12?

46229,"Bipolar documentary and how it made me feel I just finished watching a documentary about Mauro Ranallo called Bipolar Rock N Roller. For anyone who doesn’t know Mauro is an insanely successful play-by-play announcer and has called some of the biggest fights in boxing kickboxing MMA and professional wrestling. The documentary is a brutally honest look at his life and struggles with bipolar disorder.I also work in broadcasting (radio) and the documentary hit me pretty hard. Hearing him talk about everything and seeing the things he’s gone through (and still goes through) was a little weird for me because I kept saying over and over “That’s me. I do that. That happens to me too.” It was a relief in a way because it was a reminder that I’m not the only one but it was also uncomfortable to watch at times because I felt like I was watching myself. I can’t tell if I feel better or worse after seeing it. Has anyone else ever watched something like this and felt that way? Has a movie or documentary about bipolar disorder ever made you uncomfortable or even triggered an episode? Also does anyone have any recommendations for similar documentaries or specials? Thanks.

46230,"On Therapy My therapist is very talented. In fact she was booked for the entire month of December and for all but the last week of this month. That means it'll be almost two months between appointments when I'm used to seeing her twice a month. This has never happened in our quite lengthy time together and I'm scheduled through March from here on out.Therapy is an interesting thing for me. Because I come from a very traumatic background therapy has been a godsend for PTSD-related issues. What I'd never noticed before though is how much it helps me regulate my mood in between sessions. Knowing I'll have someone to help me sort through random thoughts and make sense of any major shifts or psychotic issues allows me to keep the jumble in the background. It's like static; I can tolerate the static when I know there will eventually be someone who can help me understand how the radio works. (bad example but best I can do.)My therapist pdoc and I constantly assess whether therapy is beneficial to me because it has been ongoing for quite some time. We were all of the understanding that yes in fact I get a great deal of benefit from therapy. Now I'm one month into not having therapy and things are falling absolutely apart. Suspicion confirmed.I will go on through this month doing the best I can and I will try not to break any more aspects of life. Then I will spend a couple of sessions picking up the pieces and hoping this sort of break in our therapy journey does not happen again anytime soon.",Bipolar
46231,"How much value do you place on having sex? I've been realizing that my hyper sexuality has affected how much value I put on having sex. When I was growing up I used to put so much priority on having sex. It would constantly be on my mind and I would feel like I was missing out on such a massive part of existence if I wasn't able to regularly have it. Haha that sounds so dramatic.The older I get though the more I realize that the importance I was putting on sex is mostly based on the emotions created by the mania/hyper sexuality. When I step back for a moment and stop listening to my emotions and look at it logically I don't really care as much about it. I put more value on non-sexual intimacy like snuggling/holding hands/sleeping together and the most value on having a verbal connection with someone where we can comfortably share our deepest fears and darkest secrets.Its confusing because my feelings and even my thoughts can be so drastically influenced/manipulated by the chemical reactions going on in my brain/body. So there are times where sex seems like the ultimate high. Then other times where I choose to not base my actions on achieving highs and chasing feelings and instead I do things that align with the values I have built over years based on logic and philosophy.How do you value sex do you base a lot of your actions/decisions around it? Or maybe it just seems like a bonus to being alive but doesn't matter much? Do your feelings on it drastically change based on your mental state?",Bipolar

46237,"Was misdiagnosed and put on antidepressants which lead to ""mania"". Not entirely sure of my ""proper"" diagnoses. I just didn't have a manic episode like most of you experience I think so I don't know if I believe it. After struggling with severe depressive episodes throughout my life that have caused me to drop out of school lose nearly all the jobs I've worked ect. ect. (over 10 years of bullshit) I decided to get some proper medical help. Within first day I started taking the antidepressants I experienced a pretty significant shift in my mood. Energy talking felt good. Felt ""high"" I guess. I didn't get any sleep that night though and for the next three days I don't know if I got any more than an hour of sleep a night. On each of those next days I felt like I was detached from my body a lot like I was watching myself. I started pacing in my room a lot and felt compelled to talk or else like... idk I felt like something bad would happen. I had no appetite my mind was moving way to fast to focus on anything let alone food. I was totally incapacitated by anxiety and stayed in my apartment the whole time where I feel like my roommates were all looking at me funny and put off by how weird I felt I was acting (which is funny because when I asked them about those few days they just told me I was reallly talkative but otherwise they weren't freaked out or anything). Weirdest experience was what felt like a stabbing/lightning sensation in my brain. I reallly don't know how to explain that one. In the end I started praying to God to relieve me of my suffering which was weird because I'm an athiest. I didn't take the antidepressants on the fifth day and most of this stuff ceased shortly after though I continued to not sleep very much (like 5 hours a night?) for a little while.I didn't contact my doctor for a few months because I thought everything was fine. I suddenly started cutting and dying my own hair a lot got multiple piercings and tattoos jumped fair and doing all kinds of other kinda fun wreck-less shit (never done any of these things before). Drinking a lot and being really social. Started working out got a dream job started dating again felt like my life was getting back in order.Then I just sorta stopped. Real normal for a while.Then the depression came back lost my job gaining weight ect. and I went to my doctor to talk about it and of course all this came up which lead to my diagnosis as BPII.

46251,"Tardive Dyskinesia medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone It’s hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent (13 I think) but I have been bipolar since I was a young child and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now (so still young) but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first surprisingly fine and stable but now I have been manic/hypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before. I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment. It’s just at my last appointment before the mania started we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication. I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified- terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again. I don’t really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to don’t get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with. It’s like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child (with consistent therapy with medication and with A LOT of everyday effort) is going to be ripped out from under me and it’s not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. It’s scary. It’s a lot. Sorry this is so long. I hope there are still people willing to read it. ",Bipolar
46252,"Symptoms for bipolar disorders Hello allI'm 18 years old and I'm new to Reddit. When I was ten years old I began to have depression. It wasn't severe but I would often isolate myself from others and think about dying. Over time my depression has gotten worse. However at age 12 I began to have severe mood swings. Sometimes I would get very angry at everybody and everything around me for no reason. Sometimes it would last for a few days and then I would go back to feeling ""stable"" or depressed. At age 15 I began to have three distinct and intense emotions that have taken over my life until this point. I rarely felt stable at that point. This feeling can occur for a week or less I feel veryyyyyyy euphoric. I actually love life and everything around me. I feel very energetic and hyper like a five year old. I'm bouncing off the walls and talk very fast because my thoughts race. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because my thoughts would never shut up. However I have never done anything impulsive. I'm mostly abnormally energetic and euphoric. Then I can switch to a depressive episode. These are always the longest they can last for 4-6 months. At that moment I'm extremely suicidal. I've never tried to commit suicide because I'm scared of failing but the craving is always there. I'm also hopeless think that everybody hates me and I feel so dead and emotionally tired. I sleep for 8-9 hours and I still feel tired. I can have a good day and still feel extremely miserable even though I know I shouldn't. Then after my depressive episode I can feel super angry and annoyed at everything and everybody for no reason. I just get super angry and lash out at anybody and I don't know why. This lasts for a week or less. I have been to 4 therapists and none of them have really helped; I can't really afford one right now. My family aren't very supportive it's taboo to talk about mental illness so they ignore my symptoms or brush them off as hormones since I'm a female. Could I be bipolar? Is it just hormones? your insight would be nice I hope to a doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis but your insight will be helpful. ",Bipolar
46253,Loss and depression go really well together I was doing well on new medication ping ponging a bit but never getting fully manic or fully depressed. Now I knew I would be depressed for about two weeks after the end of the semester. The change in schedule always does it. But during the second half of the semester a good friend passed away. Afterwards a good mutual friend started acting very strange sometimes flat out mean. Our relationship was strained for about a month for reasons I don't fully know. He eventually blocked me online even though we had agreed that no matter what we would say goodbye as he was graduating. I was easily able to push it all away when I needed to during the semester. Now I just keep falling deeper and deeper as opposed to the normal brief depression. I can't think of my friend that passed without thinking of the one that blocked me and vice versa.

46254,"Struggling to stay medicated (xpost from r/bipolar2) I was diagnosed a few years ago (bp2) after a long depressive stage and short hypomania. Basically I have a hard time staying medicated. I recognize that it helps make the depressive and hypomanic stages more manageable and my life more livable in some ways. However there are a few things counteracting this:I sometimes get this intense urge to cut/hurt myself. It's so intense that I can't focus on anything else and it makes me very irritable and frustrated. All I can think about is ripping my veins open I want it more than anything. Theyve tossed around the idea that it could be harm OCD but no therapy (ERP) works on it. No idea if it's that or just another facet of bipolar but it seems to get more intense and unbearable when I'm slightly affected by but not consumed by depression. This plays into wanting to stop medicating because it gets so intense that I'd almost rather be severely depressed. It's like I can't win.In a sick way I like feeling extreme emotions. I really can't describe it. I don't enjoy being severely depressed or even hypomanic and yet I want it. Even the depression.I think I deserve it. I'm not sad about deserving it either. Rather I'm angry about it. Angry about not feeling extreme emotions and instead feeling dead all the time even though I'm still experiencing rapid cycling with only sometimes less intensity.Just. I'm fucking mad. All the time. I want to flay my veins and feel all the feelings. And yet I'm sick of it all Just can anyone relate?

I had opened up to these people just to be kicked down and for the last three months I've been filled with an uneasy rage and panic attacks whenever I think of them which has been daily. I've done everything I know to do to get them out of my head but it only serves to strengthen the memory. I know that by giving them so much real estate in my head I'm giving them the power over me but I can't control it. I feel so hurt and now it's starting to cause severe paranoia in my normal life making me laugh or at those I trust. I feel lost helpless useless and full of guilt but lost of all I feel like it is all my fault for not being able to cope. I have a history of trauma bipolar depression and autism. I'm terrified of people and I don't know what to do anymore. I've resigned the idea of ever getting a job or of ever having a meaningful relationship. But know I wonder if having a standards life is out of the question as well.

With some success they manage to get to the hospital but there is nothing that can be done if they refuse to take medications. I have a friend who’s in a psychosis state and is refusing medications. He’s not functioning and no matter how often he’s brought to the hospital he won’t take the medications so he can’t get better.I’m wondering if you guys had any experience or any thoughts on whether being involuntarily medicated while your in a complete psychosis stat should be allowed.

46280,"I failed the IB diploma. I don't want to try anymore. [BD1] It's 12:29 AM here. I'm so tired of trying. I tried in the IBDP and scored 24/45 points and didn't receive my diploma. My attendance was 38% and I was in a psych ward for most of the time I wasn't there. I don't want to repeat senior year because I'm so burnt out I just don't have another senior year in me. I can't go to university because I have no ATAR. I'm applying for a remark but I was three points away from passing my HL subjects so I doubt it'll do much. I can do a diploma at a university and go onto a degree in 2020 but I know it's going to tear me apart seeing my friends doing real degrees. My dream was to study in the US. I got an ACT score of 30. I was going to go there for real! I was so excited and proud of myself when I got that score!Now I want to go back in time and slap that stupid smile off my stupid face. I was never going to make it. I was stupid to think that I could. I have had anorexia nervosa since I was eleven years old. My BMI is around 13. Every time I move my head I can feel my blood pressure doing some weird shit. I've had disordered tendencies since I was six. I do not remember a time when I was at peace with myself. I don't think I'll ever get better. I've tried so many times to heal. I'm on meds. I don't want to give up hope. There's a small part of me that wants to keep going. I really do want to be able to do a degree someday move out of home maybe even find love. God I'm so lonely. I have friends sure. But I want to experience love. It seems like it's useless to pursue that - 90% of relationships involving an individual with bipolar end in divorce. I imagine that this is higher for those with BD1. But I have so much love to give. I was in a relationship until a few weeks ago but she was emotionally abusive. I can never get better and find love because my body is disgusting. I'm very short - 5'6"" and female. I'm the shortest in my family by four inches. I'm around 36 kilograms and I only look normal. I once weight restored to the (still unhealthy for my height) 46kg and I was hideous. I looked overweight. I can never get better from my ED if I ever want anyone to love me. I don't know. Just a little rant. I'm tired of trying to get better when it seems like there is no hope for me. Just this past week I had 7 straight days of eating over 2000 calories. This was a big deal for me. I really thought I could get better. But today I freaked out and ate nothing because I saw how fat I had gotten in only one week. I need advice. What do I even do? My new psychiatrist doesn't think I'm sick enough to see me more than once every three weeks. My old one went to jail but he cared and he saw me once a week. He went under for getting caught cooking morphine but he was always lovely to me and genuinely cared. This one doesn't really think I'm sick enough to be seen more often. Although if I ask I will probably be able to go inpatient in the private hospital she works at. A friend of mine (also BD1) went IP there and found it very helpful but he's much older than me and I don't know what it was like in his ward as I was down the hall in the eating disorder program. Which I was kicked out of after four days (had panic attack and lit a cigarette in my room).So. What should I do about treatment? I have the option to go for BD or my anorexia but I don't do well with other anorexics around as they trigger me. I also have all the group thought experiments/exercises/not sure how to call them from the eating disorder unit as I got friends who've stayed there to send them to me. In theory I could complete them in my own time if I were to go for BD and stay in that ward instead of the eating disorder ward. However I do think that some of the things I didn't experience during my time in that ward (takeaway nights eating in public challenges etc) may have really helped me. So I'm fairly certain I will go inpatient but not sure which ward to go to. Also what should I do about my education? Should I just try to get over myself and do a diploma here then review my options for university (be that domestic or abroad) when that's finished or wait and see what happens with the remark or resit my exams?

46281,"A minor adjustment to my meds. So I’ve been really lucky with meds and lifestyle changes being really successful for me. I have bipolar 2 and anxiety I’ve been pretty much stable with little dips into mild depression for awhile. I was only taking gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. Gabapentin was the first mood stabilizer I ever tried and it’s always kept my hypomania at bay and my anxiety dialed down a little. Hydroxyzine comes in for sleep and breakthrough anxiety. It works. I’m productive and mostly good. But the little dips into mild depression started to string together and I feared I might go into a deep depressive episode so I just told my doctor I want to add an SSRI. We’re trying Celexa right now. So I took it last night (she said some people prefer night some morning) for the first time and couldn’t sleep very well. So I’m definitely going to switch to the morning from now on. I had a little stomach upset but not too bad. I slept less than I need to but I feel really good this morning. I’m still on my gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. And will go back to take just the hydroxyzines at night so I go back to sleeping normally. BUT I don’t know if it’s too soon to tell obviously it’s been like 12 hours but this morning I got up feeling really optimistic and happy to start my day. Maybe this is placebo effect (although I’m usually skeptical that things will work) or maybe I’m just super lucky with things working on the first try. I don’t know. Just letting y’all know that I’m feeling optimistic and happy.

46286,"An Eyeful. *Obligatory Disclaimer: Obviously I don't think that people with physical disabilities have easier lives than those with SMI per se. The thought-process I'm describing is irrational by definition. I hope my post is taken in that spirit rather than delegitimizing a different kind of disability by implying it's a lesser one.*Talking about bipolar disorder we focus on the trials and tribulations of hypo and manic episodes. Deservedly so as no other mental state perhaps carries quite the same potential for leaving a scorched earth in its wake. The depressive states aren't exactly a case of the sniffles though.Dealing with my own psychopathology I've come to fear depressive episodes more than I do the other side. Probably that's because I've only been fully manic a few times in my life and the choices I make now when hypomanic aren't quite as destructive as when I was younger. My depressive episodes are pretty profound though. Near-catatonia deep. It's strange though because suicidal ideation isn't something I often feel when I'm down in the black. What I do feel and this has been a feature of my depression for years is a morbid fixation with my eyes.A bit of background: I've always had a *lot* of trouble with my eyes. When I was a kid I had to do these weird exercises to correct a lazy eye. Then I had to start taking these prescription eyedrops because my tear ducts didn't produce enough lubrication. Later on I was diagnosed with Graves Disease (and autoimmune disorder involving the thyroid) and I started showing signs of developing Thyroid Eye Disease. I had surgery to correct that which was thankfully successful. However I became night blind and my eyes became absurdly light-sensitive. I can't drive at night now and if you see me during the day chances are good that I'm wearing sunglasses. Heh people make fun of me because I own a few extremely expensive designer sunglasses but fuck it. I figure if I'm going to be wearing something every day it may as well be well-made and make me feel good.The thing is when I'm in a depressive state I'll begin having intrusive thoughts about my eyes. Specifically blinding myself. Putting sharp needles into my eyes. Using a pipette to put a drop of nitric acid onto them. Staring into the sun for hours/days. Take a lesson from the Oedipal myth and pluck them out with my hands. Things like that.I've read literature regarding people who have strangely antagonistic ideas about certain body parts. In fact I remember a story about a woman whose psychologist gave her tips to blind herself and she did and is apparently much happier now.I don't think my eye thing is essentially a body dysmorphic thing the way it is for these other people. I've been trying to think of why that's the place my mind goes when in a depressive state but I haven't quite figured it out. I feel like I should figure it out as I feel that there's a strong non-zero possibility that I'll act on this at some point which is a pretty fucked up way to feel.My initial hypothesis is that I feel so sick inside and that some disabling external situation would... somehow validate the internal state?

I am also ""out"" about having a severe and persistent mental illness at work.However being in my office causes me some issues in being easily distracted by things going on around me. My disability causes some executive function deficits along with hyper arosal (awareness... Not the sexy kind) This summer my 5 year old was diagnosed with two chronic incurable autoimmune diseases. This of course has made mental health stuff worse. I was lucky to be in a DBT program when it happened or I'd be in a horrible spiral right now. I knew it would effect my performance and I asked my direct supervisor and manager about working from home 8 to 16 hours a week as an accommodation. At previous jobs this has been heart for keeping me up to date in notes. I was told that as an orginzation we do not have a policy for this.I said fuck it and worked from home anyways (making sure I didn't go over my hours) and got caught up. Woo! Over the fall we had a lot of staffing changes and I wound up with double the work load for 3 months. I have stopped working from home becuse I was worried in would get caught and get sacked. My performance has suffered and my new supervisor has noticed.I again went to my supervisor and director and was told the same thing about their being no policy allowing us to work from home. So I went to HR with documentation from my care provider. HR just now got back to me after a month. Again they implied they where (but didn't out right) denying the request. I've been in contact with an ADA specialist in my state along with AskJAN about this and it's super frustrating. The best/worst and most ironic part of all of this?

46306,"New job schedule is triggering my hypomania I have a part-time job on some days where I usually work from 5-9 pm and get home at 10 to go to sleep. But I just started a new full-time 8 am - 4 pm job M-F. Because of the distance I have to be at the bus stop around 7 am. I know this is risky but I really could use the money. (My family was bad with money so I have ""security issues"" about not having enough cash in the bank.)The first few days were a little rough because my body wasn't used to the schedule change. Getting out of bed was a struggle. But after a few days of that I woke up with the most sublime energy the kind that begs to be released and shown to the world. My first thought was ""Fuck yeah I'm all better now!"" My thought process is still accelerating to generate all these new ideas. One day I'm going to write essays on my leftist theories on the occult (don't worry they make sense to me) for some kind of publication and get famous. But I don't have the patience to sit down and read any relevant literature - I just can't go fast enough and I want to throw the book across the room. I've also started another goal to lose weight because I realized I don't need as much ""fuel"" to stay energetic as I thought I did. I think the moment I realized I was hypomanic was the hypersexuality the symptom I'm most ashamed of as I'm usually a very disciplined and self-controlled person. I think the major reason why I didn't end up acting on those impulses later that night (I had the night off) was that my back was in a lot of pain and I had to be still (ugh) the rest of the night.

A common pattern - I will go into therapy of some kind talk about how I'm depressed I'm sad all the time feel like nothing ever helps me meds never work I want to kill myself and the only thing stopping me is fear it won't work. Get frustrated at all their suggestions walk out feeling worse than I did going in. Then my meds will get adjusted or I'll cycle back up again and feel absolutely fine and quit therapy until the next crisis. Because of this I'm sure my chart is covered with notes about how I'm a difficult patient irrational dramatic draining argumentative and I have have clinicians suggest I have borderline pd or at least traits of it. The thing is when I'm euthymic I'm not like this at all. I may be a little more sensitive than the average person but other than that I'm perfectly normal. Anyway my point is that I always get embarrassed by how melodramatic I get during depressive episodes and because of this I am scared to go back to therapy and repeat this pattern. I already have a lot of difficulty opening up to people and have always found therapy insanely difficult and this just makes it worse.

Therapy didn't help me either I'm a self-diagnosed compulsive liar and therapy did nothing for me because I just lied to my therapist about a bunch of trivial things so I never allowed her to get close. I think I lie mostly because I don't like people getting to know too much about me and my life though often I also just lie for no reason at all. I'm not a sociopath or psychopath I do experience emotions very much and sometimes I get angry at myself for lying to people I care about. &amp;#x200B;For some reason at some point when I was 17 I just could not manage to call my psychiatrist nor my therapist for another appointment.

I went and saw my doctor today and she wants me to be on a mix of depakote (extended release because immediate didn’t work) and fluoxetine. I’m asking for any and all advice. Trying this many different meds in such a short amount of time is awful. It’s taking a toll on not just me but my family. I need to get this crap figured out! I’m almost to a point where I don’t wanna be medicated at all because apparently?! None work for me. I’m so disappointed and discouraged. Has anyone had this cocktail of meds and had it work?

46350,"PSA: Steroids And Worsening Of Bipolar Symptoms Disclaimer: I am not a doctor so please always consult with yours when you seek medical treatment.I don't see this talked about enough. It's flu season and many of us may become sick and be prescribed steroids. Steroids have the chance of worsening bipolar symptoms and may send you into a mixed episode or manic episode or worse. If you are prescribed steroids please mention your bipolar diagnosis with your doctor. I'm sure there are cases of bipolar people that have taken steroids and have come out fine afterwards. I'm sure there are cases where a bipolar person is required to take steroids as there are infinite personally specific medical conditions and situations. But ask yourself these questions: Have you disclosed your bipolar disorder to the practitioners prescribing steroids? Are you stable? Are you medicated? Do you have the resources to get emergency help should things go wrong? I was sick last year and prednisone almost made me kill myself. I had no idea that steroids could make my bipolar disorder worse. I spent over a week in hell as it left my system. Apparently it even awakens bipolar disorder in otherwise stable bipolars. If anyone has any evidence to the contrary or input or experience please post.

46351,"Is this me? /off my chest/ I'm not asking legit medical advice all I'm wondering is some direction in why I am the way I am. and at the same time it's a bit of an / off my chest /. I've never felt quiet right but I tried to accept it as I never wanted to be categorized as someone who's mentally ill. But lately I notice I'm getting worse and the only way to describe it for me when I found the word 'Manic depression'/'Bipolar'. It's as if I felt understood for the first time. A lot of my time I spend alone on my room except when I go out to meet friends. So my family doesn't know much of my personality. Last summer I had a job at the same restaurant my sister works and she/coworkers noticed how I'm often staring into space while smiling and this is a big part of me. Whenever I experience this full on power high feeling as described by people during manic depression I get lost in my fantasies and I feel as if the world surrounding me no longer exist and build up whole scenario's and imagine people to be near me. For example I would imagine to be in a big house while holding a conversation with a person I want to speak with and I would laugh at their jokes as if it were their jokes. most of the time my life is amazing in these deep daydreams sometimes they could be described as another persons nightmare. I'm not even hating this. I feel a part of it is a coping mechanism which goes hand in hand with my natural creativity. And I love the force of energy I have during these moments. How I can smile as if I'm drunk just by staring and thinking about all the amazing things i can accomplish. by thinking how charming I am. And then the next second I could cry. I'm not sure if it's how I really feel sad. Or if it's an overload of happiness that makes me sad in the moment. ButI really burst of energy in which I actually do accomplish a lot. I know it's not a healthy me but it's the best version of myself if I want to get things done. I feel as if it isn't totally me but more a phase. But I love who I am during this phase. Because the other part of me is depressed and has no energy. I hate admitting to this part because while I know my life situation sucks and would had likely made anyone insane and as I have experienced horrible things and have anxiety I hate accepting that a big other side of me is useless by depression. As I feel like I'm constantly trying to fight it and these moments of feeling high/happy actually make me feel at times as if I'm on the right track. But now I read more about this subject I feel I'm not winning any battle at all when feeling high on energy is just another extreme on the spectrum. The weirdest thing I have done in these daydreams is travel to another country because I felt like i could(financielle it wasnt the greatest choice) like it could be amazing. I fell asleep in the airplane and once I woke up i was wondering what I was doing. I don't regret it and still had an okay time for a couple of days but i do notice it isn't normal behaviour and cried one night wishing to be home again. I'm planning to upload soon a cover of me singing on the internet but i'm slightly afraid of the attention among friends I will get as it will likely impact my emotions. I'm not into getting attention as it will bring out either side of me but I never know which one. Sigh will be a rollercoaster. ",Bipolar

The medication is proven to be severely damaging to our bodies and often meds stop working all together but are difficult to stop taking due to withdrawals.

46381,"A sense of place Hi guys....this is a post I've been thinking of making for a while but I have a hard time wording it. It's one of the big things I struggle with and I think it contributes to my anxiety and depression but I don't know how to express it to others.Here it is: I grew up in a rural area and I hated it. When I went away to college at age 18 I moved to a suburb outside of a major city met great new people from all over the world explored the city even though the college is about a 30 min drive/subway ride from it. Basically.....I had fun felt comfortable with the people around me explored new places and felt proud of where I was even though to others it was a bland suburb.Ever since finishing college I have been searching for that feeling again: that feeling of just being in the right spot where I need to be. It's been almost 15 years since I left that area. Since then I've lived in 3 different places two suburbs of major cities and downtown in a mid-size city.Everywhere I go I long for that feeling of knowing that where I am is a perfect fit....that feeling I only had for the six years (Bachelors and Masters at the same college) I lived in that suburb at my college.I now live in a suburb of another major city...basically the same distance (about 30 min) away from the city but with good public transportation so I can go to the city anytime I want...just like the suburb where I went to college. I have met a few great friends here. It is basically the same situation (suburb of a large city good friends good public transit to put me in the city when I want to go there).......but I almost hate it here. It doesn't make any sense! My husband is obsessed with buying a house here (which is a crazy fantasy bc there's no way we can afford a downpayment anytime soon but that's a whole other issue) and I almost get panic attacks thinking about staying here for the rest of my life.And yet every time we move I'm dissatisfied there too. My husband says that if it were up to me we'd just keep moving from place to place for the rest of our lives because whenever we end up somewhere I immediately start talking about moving somewhere else.On paper these places are basically the same as the place where I felt the most comfortable but they don't feel right...in the three places I've lived since leaving that college I've felt like a puzzle piece that just doen't fit.I guess i'm just wondering if anyone else feels this way: a sense of never being in the place where you belong....or is this just my own anxiety that's for some reason clinging to this particular issue?I hope this makes sense.

Over the course of 5 months post-hospitalization I tried a myriad of medical concoctions including lithium abilify latuda and many others whose name I’ve since forgotten. Whether due to the depressive episode that came directly after my manic one or the terrible side effects I decided I would go off medications.So now it’s been 19 months since I’ve taken any medications. I’ve avoided drugs alcohol and other stressors. I make sure to sleep 8-10 hours a day eat healthy drink lots of water workout meditate etc. and it seems like I’ve been stable. I still get occasional periods of depression which I easily ride out or bursts of hypomania which makes life easier however all delusions/serious effects have all but disappeared.I recognize however that can be an illusion and at any point things can spin outside of my control. So recently I got a pdoc to write a prescription for Latuda however I haven’t picked up the medication yet because I’m starting to question whether I should get back on it.This is primarily because I feel like the effects of long-term medication use can have irreversible consequences on the brain. It doesn’t help that we have had 0 longitudinal studies showing the effects of staying on these medications for 20+ years (if there are I'd love to see them!). So given that I’m currently stable I am having a hard time convincing myself to start taking medications indefinitely.

46388,"Hello concerned daughter here HelloI hope this isn't against the rules but I'm posting here hoping to find some advice and a little support. I'm (f26) from Holland and my mom (55) has been in the psychiatric hospital for about 3 months now. Looking back I guess she already hit a manic state about 7 months back. The trigger seemed to be a renovation (of the whole area) that started in September 2018. She was constantly worried that I was going to be raped by the construction crew. At a certain I wasn't allowed to do any chores at home and she started treating me like I was 9 or something.Then she stopped taking her meds she offered her body to a friend (even though she is disgusted by sex) and started going on shopping sprees. She only got commited cuz she kept me up at night for a week straight which sorta forced her to seek help. Now she blames me for getting her commited. She also told me my stepdad doesn't want to have sex with me because I'm fat (I have been diagnosed with c-ptsd because of past abuse of a familymember so this was extremely hurtful on multiple levels). She accused me trying to control her when I asked her why she didn't pay rent and suddenly my boyfriend is too dumb and autistic to function and she hates his guts.This isn't even half of the things she has done or said. I'm am tired and exhausted. She suddenly came home today late at night because she claims she is getting abused by the everyone and she left. I quickly packed a bag and left to go to my stepdads house she freaked out started yelling then asked her if I could forgive her.Here's the thinge I don't doubt it that she will get better. But I am constantly incredible angry and upset I have no patience anymore. I am constantly swinging between being scared she is going to hurt herself and just hoping that she does just so I can be done with all of this. I feel guilty and I am just drained of all my energy all the damn time.Is there anything I can do? Is there any advice you guys have for me when dealing with my mother? I don't want to hate her after all of this is done.P.s. I am already looking at other housing options and an in-house therapist of my doctors clinic is helping me trying to get urgency to move. I am also in a lot of contact with the people from the mental facility my mom is commited in. School is also quite aware of what is going on I can always stay at my stepdads house (who has never done anything weird to me ever) and my boyfriend is an angel who is always ready to help me. I am exercising eating right and always try to get 8 hours of sleep.tldr: mom is manic and borderline abusive driving me crazy.

46389,"Diagnosed Borderline but having my diagnosis looked into. Recent letter mentions the word euthymic over and over after psych said it could of been Bipolar I didn’t know how to write the title to explain my situation so here it goes..I’ve had mental health issues since 14 been in the system since 17. I’m now 32. Nan has Schizophrenia on my mother’s side. I’ve had two psychotic episodes and my clinical notes state psychotic disorder and borderline personality disorder. After being out of the system for several years. I seeked help again after some warning symptoms under a new team. Under the new team I requested that I had my diagnosis looked into again.I’ve met with this new team a few times now but the most recent letter from the minutes of that meeting mention the word euthymic three times. The psych also stated during that meeting that my previous psychosis ‘could of been bipolar’. I’ve researched the word euthymic and I can only find a correlation to Bipolar and no results on euthymia with Borderline. I’m here because I’d like some insight into what they may mean by this ‘euthymic state’. Well it says euthymic then later on in the mental state part it says ‘euthymic reactive state’. Please help shed some light on this I’m clueless.

46390,"Improving Physique and Body Confidence causing onset of some mania symptoms? Hey guys I’m a 22 yo male in college and I have been lifting 6 days a week for a while now. I would say I’m pretty built and over the last few weeks I have definitely been becoming more defined (guess that happens when the holiday season and all the food that comes with it finishes haha). My body confidence is definitely improving and my attitude in general has become better because of it. The issue is the last time I really looked good it caused me to almost have too much confidence and for someone with bipolar I feel this could be an issue. The last time I crashed there were a lot more factors involved and I have learned a lot since. I do not drink alcohol anymore and I have cut back my marijuana usage substantially. I am currently eating a normal amount of food and getting enough sleep everyday. But I’m noticing some possible signs of some type of mania coming if I’m not careful. This means I will probably have to up my meds dealing with the mania but these meds often cause weight gain so taking more may take away a lot of what I have worked for exercise-wise. I feel like I’m stuck in that I have to make a choice between my mental and physical health (along with my body confidence). I will obviously choose mental health if push comes to shove because I do not want to experience the same crash that I did last time but it just feels unfair. Has anyone had some type of experience with this? I have an appointment with my psychiatrist coming up and I’m wondering what is best to say to her.

46394,"Is my therapist at fault or am I being paranoid? F25. I've been seeing my M66 psychiatrist for the past 2 years and everything has been great. He's always been a very good professional and never made me feel uncomfortable. Considering that I've known how he approaches therapy for 2 years now I find it very strange that he has suddenly changed our boundaries - and without asking me. First thing is that one day instead of a good bye handshake he said ""I'm going to hug you today"" and he did so. I didn't mind (goodbye hugging is very common in my culture) but I don't like that he didn't ask first if that was ok instead of just announcing it and going for it. He proceeded with doing this again after every session since then. Then last time he kissed me on the cheek (also common and non-sexual way to say goodbye in my culture) but still strange as he's never done it before. He also called me once to check on me and ask how I was feeling (I had just lost my dad so maybe that's fine) but he's also never done that before all these years. Today I cancelled our next appointment because something came up and he said ok but I have to pay for it anyway which I know some therapists do but 1) mine never does and 2) I cancelled way earlier than the timespan that would require me to pay.

Because of various medical stuff she had going on at the time we didn’t really speak much. We had been planning to marry and move together. That didn’t happen. I was completely blindsided by all this. Three months later I left town for medical treatment. Even though she said she wasn’t going to do this she completely ghosted me when I left.My treatment hasn’t really worked. Eight months later now I am getting closer to being unable to do my work.

I was telling my pdoc about how I’m struggling recovering from the holidays. When I was out of town with my family for about a week I had one beer the entire time. My four hour drive home ended up being six hours due to three separate accidents. It was taking me multiple days to recuperate it felt like I had been on a drinking binge. When I told her all this she said sometimes stress and changes in the environment can affect the way your liver functions just as much as it can affect your brain. The stress of family then being hit with an especially stressful trip from sea level to 7000 ft could have really messed things up. So I’m giving this a try. She ordered some “liver sauce” for me. It’s this gnarly tasting oil I take as soon as I wake up then thirty mins later I have to take a charcoal binder. If it were some random person telling me to ditch my meds and do a liver cleanse instead I’d tell them to fuck off. But I’ve been with this pdoc for almost a decade now so I’m trusting her judgement. I’m still on all my meds and she told me to try and be more mindful about what I’m putting in my body.

46428,"I don't know how to explain this. Maybe I just need to rant. I've been sober for a year and 3 months. I take my meds everyday without fail. I eat pretty good and try to get outside as much as I can even though I'm a shut in agoraphobic. I go to therapy. My problems are dealt with my stressors are at a minimum.Why the fuck am I depressed? Why the fuck can't I sleep? Seriously it's almost 8am and now my schedule is completely out the window. I'm not even hypomanic I don't have any energy. I've been laying here watching YouTube eating left over pizza just kind of doing nothing. I'm so pissed.The worst part is there's a cycle! An actual honest to god cycle. Not just a bipolar cycle where triggers set things off. No no no. This is a biological cycle. You see I have PCOS. And every time I've gotten my period since I was 9 years old it's made me depressed moody bitchy argumentative etc. A lot of the time I start to think this is all from my hormones and I don't even have bipolar. I'd be even more convinced if my lithium didn't work great within 2 days of my first time taking it and it didn't run rampant in my family. Alas I have the family curse.But seriously having PCOS is a fucking curse too. I use the app Clue to track my cycle and I just checked it tonight to see where I'm at and realized why I was being such a cunt to my fiance all weekend and never wanted to leave the apartment. Why I keep falling asleep later and later in the morning everyday and can't get out of bed until the late afternoon. I'm fucking 25 years old! This is so stupid. I haven't been able to have a job in years because of this and I've never gotten any kind of relief from any doctor.Those fake sun lamps don't help. Melatonin doesn't do shit. Sleeping pills make me hallucinate. I've been checked for any type of vitamin deficiencies. I try to fix my schedule at least once a month where I won't sleep for like 30 hours. It's ridiculous it's the same shit all year every year.I'm so sorry if this isn't really a bipolar post I think it is because I feel like my cycle effects my bipolar so much that this happens every month.

She were there for me the whole time but things worked out in a way that I developed a crush on her. I really thought ""wtf mania. Again?"". But I had my lithium tests talked to my psychiatrist and sadly I wasn't manic at all. I was really suffering because she has her problems too and when I try to talk with her about it she doesn't respond well. I tried do keep my distance try to get over it but she likes me a lot and we became even closer. Relationships are a huge problem for me and my friend is in a different phase of life. She broke with her first boyfriend recently (they were together from age 13 till 18 church boyfriend holding hands only she was unhappy) and now she is dating a lot of guys no strings attached a lot like what I do but it hurts for me to see it. I started avoiding being at the same places she goes to and the others close to me are telling me she is not really all that. So I decided to put our friendship on a hold too since I'm unhappy with this ""let's speed date everyone we can and maybe we'll get together at the end"". I can't keep having sex and making out with strangers to compensate her actions you know? It became toxic. Yesterday we've had a huge fight about it because I told her I didn't like to be exposed this way.

46430,"A story going from manic to depressive Bipolar II explained My eyes open. WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE. Why was I so down yesterday? Maybe I should go to the gym. No no: maybe I should get some work done. Yes work I’ve been neglecting work. Actually maybe I should pay rent I’m a couple of days overdue. I put on my favourite song. What a great fucking song my auditory cortex shoots out musical notes like buckets of cum for my vagina of a cerebral cortex to process and enjoy. First I need to make breakfast. What’s the most optimal amount of nutrients I can make in a meal for my body weight? I research this for a couple of hours; I want to know anything and everything about how nutrients work from the macro to the micro level. I order an organic chemistry book. I order a vegetable juicer. I order 5 different multivitamins and 2 fish oils. I go for a run planning my ultimate breakfast. I am so excited. I get a few hours of work done life is so fucking great. Hell maybe I’ll even find a girlfriend soon. Maybe I can share this with my friends. I haven’t spoken to them in a while but I think it would be really great to catch up. So I plan 3 coffee dates for tomorrow. Perfect that will scratch my social itch. I also want to get REALLY fucking high. Or maybe I’m just craving affection. Peaking on MDMA and having my first kiss felt identical. So does the mdma comedown and breaking up. I don’t deal with relationships very well. I’m either careless or obsessive. Very rarely do I find a good fit in fact I haven’t yet. But I’ve learned from my mistakes.My thoughts start racing. Maybe I’ll never find someone to give this boundless love to. Maybe I’m not attractive enough. Maybe I’m too weird. Who spends 4 hours planning their breakfast? Sometimes I say things I don’t mean. Sometimes I just want people to like me. Sometimes I won’t shut up. Sometimes friends say they like me or click well with me but it doesn’t feel genuine. Are all my relationships fake? I’m definitely overthinking this. This can’t be true. My dad comes into my room and asks how applying to work is going I tell him to fuck off. I can’t believe I just said that. I’m just mentally fucked up and waiting for my meds to work this must be the case. My friends like me right? I need to slow down my thoughts this is driving me mad. I order some ket haven’t eaten all day and decide to order pizza. I binge and fall asleep. I wake up. The greyness of the bleak sky reflects through my cold window. I gather all my strength to go take a shower. I made it to the bathroom and undress. I’ve put on weight. My brutal acne medicine isn’t working as promised in fact it’s made it worse. I’ve ignored calls from my landlord for days now there’s no way I can call him and sort it out. I dropped out of school I’m a fucking failure. I put on my favourite song. My auditory cortex hits me cerebral cortex with notes like harpoons to Moby Dick. What trash how can anybody enjoy music?Oh fuck I have to meet up with my friends today. I try and get myself together and make a lazy breakfast. One friend calls me and says he can’t make it. I’m somewhat upset but also relieved. I meet up with my other friend. We have a seemingly normal conversation but I am fucking shattered. I can’t tell if he can tell or not. I leave the conversation feeling defeated I’ve had so much to say and nothing but small talk left my mouth. He must think I’m boring I despise being boring. I return home to find my books vitamins and juicer waiting for me in a parcel at my doorstep. I’m never gonna use this shit what’s the point? Ah but yes my ket arrived I’ll get a couple of hours of peace completely zombified. My dad calls me when I’m all fucked up. He can tell I’m fucked up and he’s worried I’m going to overdose. I try to pretend to be sober and he tries to pretend to believe that I’m sober as to not upset me more it’s the saddest thing in the world. He drives me to the emergency unit and I get my vitals checked all is seemingly fine. My parents have been nothing but supportive and I’m still like this.

46453,"Am I bipolar? tldr; got a diagnosis for bipolar as I was incredibly agitated and restless after a bad reaction to some medication and hospitalized as a manic episode. However I didn't feel elated and I was lucid. Is this bipolar or should I get a second opinion. I'm 31 years old and male.Apologies for the essay.Basically my story starts when I was very depressed and anxious for most of my adult life and medication and therapy didn't do anything to really help. I tried Zoloft one day after the recommendation of my Dr. I woke up in the middle of the night all the time in a panic and couldn't think straight and after a week I was so restless I had to go to hospital. The attending Dr at the hospital said that it is a common reaction to medication if you're bipolar and prescribed me Olanzapine.After 2 months I hated the medication as it made me so sleepy and gain weight. So I decided to stop as I didn't need this before for 31 years. I was also prescribed Klonopin. I stopped Olanzapine and became very restless but I could deal with it with the Klonopin and I took it for 2 weeks. I remember the first day I stopped and I felt amazing though like fully focused and full of positive energy to do things. However one day I forgot to take Klonopin and it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I spent the next month waking up in the middle of the night in panic feeling super restless in the morning and struggling to focus on anything.I came off the Klonopin after that bad experience (but slowly tapered I learned my lesson from the Olanzapine not to come of medication too quickly). I also got some Trazadone for sleep since I couldn't sleep for the whole night and would wake up in a panic and also couldn't get back to sleep despite feeling tired. As time went on over the course of 3 months I stopped having the panic attacks in the night but would wake up super early really restless but exhausted. I also started to have depersonalization and had this spaced out feeling a lot of the time and I would sort of feel like I was looked at myself in the third person. This carried on and didn't get better with time over the course of a few months.Around thanksgiving I got really drunk and after then the restlessness became unbearable. I was also super emotional and couldn't focus. But I was fully aware of everything and I didn't do anything reckless and I didn't feel elated or anything. I basically tried to stick it out but couldn't take it and went to hospital and they put me in a psychiatric ward as I was so agitated and restless and it was then they told me they thought I was bipolar and put me on Olanzapine again.I've stuck it out for a few months and to be fair after two weeks of taking Olanzapine and Depakote I started to feel much less restless and I was able to sleep fully. Also the spaced out feeling subsided and started to feel myself again. However the medication has left me super sleepy and it's affecting my work. With my psychiatrist's help we're going to lower the medication dose but after that reduction I'm feeling a bit spaced out but less so than I was before. I'm still super sleepy though.Basically I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and I kind of feel like I've been put in a bipolar box in terms of a diagnosis but when I look at classic bipolar behavior I don't really see it in myself? Has anyone else experienced anything like me? Like severe agitation inability to sleep and depersonalization but also being lucid not engaging in reckless behavior and not having an elated mood?Also that was a massive post so thanks if you read it :)",Bipolar

On the psy level i feel more serene and the depression disapeared. I feel like i can see more clearly the things about my life. I dont feel this hole inside me anymore. I dont feel this deep sadness its really weird to be free from this. But there is a second effect. My cynism level is rising sky rocket ! I always been a cynic person with a touch of misanthropism. But now this is a new level of this. I dont see my friends anymore. I dont answer them when they call. To be honnest i just dont see the point. Before when i felt lonely and depressed i needed them to keep my mind busy and dont let the negavity take the control. Now ? Whats the point ? I evolve in a particular social environment. Wealthy artist people... And now i realize that i dont really like them. Also the sadness disappeared but i feel 100% lost in life. In a world where wealth fame possession seems to be everything i give absolutely no value to this. To be honnest i dont even know what is valuable. Yes well virtue honor compassion heart are valuable values to me but its just an utopia in this world. I just feel like there is no point to even try to exist in this world. I'm not interested in making a family not interested in money. As soon as it comes to money i lose all interest in something. The egyptians were buried with their possessions and we are the witness of what it becomes. So whats the point ? Thats my major problem. I thought it was depression. But i think its just myself. I just feel like the modern society is wrong about everything. Like if we missed the purpose of our existence. I remember when i was a kid i watched on tv a report about a temple in Thailand for drugs addicts reability called Tham Krabok. And there was that man an ex us soldier of fortune who went there to overcome a alcohol addiction. After his rehab he stayed there and became a monk. He died recently after dedicating 30 years of his life to this temple. That is a great life. That is what life should be about. In my opinion ofc. So all that to say that yes i'm bipolar. Never experienced high psychotic episode. My episode are soft. Just compulsive needs to buy thing to overcome emptyness. Sexual urge and needs. Planing big things but i still quite about it i never talk about that to people as i remember that its not normal. But the reality will still disappoint me. Without or with medication....

Told me to never contact her again. Now I feel like I'm in hell. I have a family. I have a handful of friends. But I can't build a real trusting relationship with them. I’ve tried so hard. I have some really bad trust and attachment issues because of my dad leaving when I was 5. And then when I was 12 my mom also left(but thankfully my dad took me in and raised me from then on). This has left me in a way that I can only do one of two things. Either not get attached at all or get extremely attached. But because of the extreme attachment leading to hurt in previous relationships I had purposefully put space between me and others.She was the first person in a long time who I really opened up to and let in. I thought she was doing the same to me. We were so insanely close. Then I did one dumbass thing which I didn't realize was a dumbass thing and she just turned cold on me. It's like all the stuff she told me about how much she needed me how much she loved me and how she would be devastated with me just disappeared. I've spent the last several weeks trying to fix things with her warming up a bit then turning cold then warming up then turning cold. I can't put all the blame on her for this. Me going from begging and pleading for forgiveness to yelling and screaming at her for abandoning me and then back to the other one made the situation way worse. But I was at such a low point I was actually planning my suicide and I was just desperate to have her back. It was so painful and anger inducing that this person who I gave everything to didn't even care about it. I put her in front of me. I have suffered so that I could make sure she didn't. I'm not an innocent angel in all of this. I'm clingy I'm needy I'm unstable and high maintenance. I also have extreme mood swings. But I also loved her. Fully and completely. I thought she knew this. I was willing to do anything it took to make her want to stay. I tried everything I knew. But it all failed. After one too many fights things are at a definite end. There is no going back. Now I'm feeling so isolated and alone. The only person I could talk to hates me. It feels like no one else is even trying to understand me.To them ""she's just some girl. Just move on."" They don't know her like I do. She's amazing in every way. The day after I attempted suicide last March 25th I was in the emergency room alone. I was so scared and I had no one to talk to. She called and texted me as much as she could(she works as a waitress). Kept telling me that things will be okay and that she would be there for me. That’s what made her so special. When everyone else was freaked out and pushed away she would run forward and try to help me. And I lost that.All I can think about is that it took me 23 years to meet this one person who I got along with on such a deep level. Is it going to take another 23 to meet the next? And even if I do they will never be able to replace her. It was nice to be in a relationship(whether it be friends romantic or familial) where I felt like I could just fully and completely be myself. I just miss her so much. The depression and stress I'm feeling from this is making my bipolar disorder spin out of control as well which is just fucking annoying as well. When I met her I was at a point where all I could think about was killing myself. I felt there was no hope. Nothing would get better. Now without her I'm basically back in that headspace and it sucks. I just feel so hopeless and empty. It hurts to breathe. Every morning I wake up and I feel ok for about a minute. Then reality comes crashing in and I just cry till I can’t.I do go to a psychiatrist who is also a therapist. This is my 5th Psych and 3th Therapist in the last 2.5 years. They've tried over 2 dozen meds and a stupid amount of hours of therapy. Nothing has worked so far. I'm basically giving up at this point. I even told my psych that a few days ago.

I came out of the appointment very upset because the doctor didn't seem to want to help me didn't seem to get what I was saying wanted me to stop taking the meds that had pulled me out of a year-long suicidal depression. I hadn't slept more than an hour the night before so the appointment is a bit of a blur but I felt betrayed by the system and cried for hours.I saw the pdoc for a second time today and my impression of her was completely different. Apparently she is not a psycho monster bitch. She clearly wants to help me and has a reasonable approach even if it's not what I would have chosen.I also realized that I have gaps in my memory from that time - like I know one of my friends was concerned enough about my state of mind to call my mother - but for example I completely don't remember one of my friends coming over and visiting me for several hours. Granted I was drinking a lot over that period but not enough to completely forget events. It makes me wonder what else I'm not remembering.I'm diagnosed BPII but I know that over about 6 weeks I spent way too much money hardly slept (or sometimes even didn't) for days at a time and drove so recklessly that I could have been arrested if I had been caught.

My first thought was whether or not they knew I wouldn't be taking it for epilepsy and I would get away with getting it for free!Next I searched for Cymbalta and it was there! Listed as an antidepressant. In fact they had nearly all your antidepressants on there. Lithium is on the list and even some anti anxiety meds.Sure enough when I filled my prescriptions they were free.I mean it makes good business sense. I am more expensive if I end up in the hospital. Just like quitting smoking drugs are frequently covered because you're a lower risk if you quit.For some reason it just made me feel good. Like hey it's just an illness and we know you need meds to keep it under control. No big deal. Or something. It also made me very people for everyone under this plan because while I do not currently have any issues paying for my meds I know what it's like to be in that position and it's horrible.

46495,"Been lurking over a year on this sub and wanted to share some good news. So I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features as per my diagnoses and I wanted to share some good news with this wonderful community. I will preface this by saying that after I got out of the hospital over a year ago (pretty long and arduous stay around 4 months) I was lost and I had no optimism about my future once I got my phone back I started googling med related things and this subreddit would always come up. I started to realize slowly that there are a large number of people with bipolar living productive and stable lives and that exhibit linear thinking. I thought I was relegated to being acutely ill for the rest of my life and that. I would have at least two major manic episodes a year that would always get me hospitalized. I will spare some of the details about these episodes because they are honestly a bit embarrassing and I imagine they could be triggering (drug usage). Anyways it has been over a year since my last manic episode and I haven't even experienced hypo-mania in the interim. Over the last year I went from living in group homes and care facilities to finally going back to college and getting A's and went back to work. I have been living in my own apartment for 5 months and have never had a period of stability this long. I think what actually worked for me was staying on medication for more than 6 months and working with a treatment team. I am actually really happy with my psychiatrist from Stanford and actually appreciate his style. He doesn't just shove pills in my face and actually takes over an hour to ask about how im doing and then during the last 5 minutes we talk about meds. He was even willing to take me off of my monthly injection and switch me to a lower dose oral dosage which seemed shocked me as the shot was the one thing that I would consistently take due to non-compliance.

46496,"Question about lithium and possible secondhand effects? Hello I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but I am hoping someone knows what I’m talking about because I’m super frustrated and I tried to ask my doctor but they don’t know the answer either. Basically my partner has been on lithium the day we met and ever since meeting them I’ve had frequent breakouts patches of eczema emerging and rashes all over my body. My period has also been coming late every month since meeting them and I have ALWAYS been regular and on time. And now I’m starting to have these pinkish bumps on my face (not pimples I think.. blood would come out if I squeezed them) and their acne has also been getting a lot worse too. I’ve never had such a big reaction to anything before and I’m highly suspecting it’s their medication because I don’t know what else it could possibly be.. (we tried to switch soaps and detergents etc) They said that their previous partners never complained about any skin problems or etc but they only started lithium when they met me. Are secondhand effects possible from lithium? Has anyone else’s partners experienced the same thing or am I being paranoid?",Bipolar

46501,"Transitioning Treatment from Symptoms to Behaviors So I’ve been officially diagnosed with bipolar for about a year now. I had been diagnosed as all sorts of things before we settled on this. The medication has been working well now that I’m on the right things and I’ve made a couple lifestyle changes like spending less time with my more reckless friends and not sleeping because I just could. And all of that has been going very well and so is therapy. But this week I had a realization about how messed up a lot of my mental relationships with things like sex and my past romantic relationships. On particular the combination of those two things and a lot of anger and shame about how I’ve handled things in the past. What I realized this week in therapy was my perspective has been all about limiting symptoms and episodes I’ve been sleeping cause it makes me feel better. But I have been mad at myself for a long time about how I handled a breakup without changing the underlying behavior and not thinking about how it has kept me in the same place. And that is an awesome realization. But what scares me is contending with the behavior. How I’m going to change what I’m doing not how I feel. I realize the two are connected but adding the other mode is scary. I’ve always thought that you can say I did this because of my bipolar and that explains the behavior but doesn’t excuse it. I just wanted to ask if people have gone through a similar process? And if so how did it go and how did they deal with it? Thank you ",Bipolar

I was recently diagnosed with unipolar mania/bipolar NOS after having a ton of hypomanic episodes over the past three years (started out as 1-2 a year but over the last six months I've had at least one a month each lasting up to 10 days).I just started lithium so I had my bloodwork pulled and my TSH showed up with a result of 2.78 mIU/L. My psychiatrist looked at that result and said that we need to get it below 2 and that she thought my high TSH was the reason I was rapid cycling.She wants to get me on a synthetic thyroid and I'm skeptical. 2.78 mIU/L seems to be within healthy reference ranges though it is on the high side and I can't find any evidence that higher TSH values cause rapid cycling for mania.

46520,"Does anyone else have difficulty accepting your diagnosis when hypomanic or manic? I am a 30 year old psychiatric RN I was first diagnosed with bipolar I when I was 23 years old. In retrospect I may have had 1-2 manic episodes before then- I was medicated a short time felt better and then I talked myself out of my diagnosis. I would tell myself that I was just stressed and unhappy with my life so I was essentially just rebelling. It wasn't until what I believe to be my 3rd or 4th spring/summer manic episode that I sought treatment because I could see the cycle. Context: My first episode I had been married for 5 years (got married to a man in the army when I was 18) I had two children who were 3 and 5 at the time. A lot had changed I was going to nursing school which was terribly stressful I was drinking a lot and smoking a lot of pot. My husband was lazy as fuck and would lay around all day and expect me to come home from a day of school and work and do all the shit around the house. Anyway I began to say things to him like ""you're not my father"" ""I'll do what I want I'm an adult"" ""If I want to go out with my friends I will"".... Which are things I had never said to him before... but I started to feel like my life wasn't enough and I needed more. So I started with the sexual symptoms I was reaching out to plenty of people men women... everyone my boss his son... and I started doing really shitty things. One time I told my husband I was leaving to pick up a friend and I ended up going to a party and getting fucked up and never came home that night... and I had a lot of nights where I drank in excess and can't recall the events... Needless to say by the end of the summer I had looked my husband in the face and told him without any feelings whatsoever that I did not love him anymore and I was moving out. He was DEVASTATED and I didn't care. I took my two kids and moved into an apartment. He would say things like HOW do you not care? It wasn't until I came down from that episode that I realized how fucked up my choices were and actually cried about my massive life change. Episode 2: I had remarried by then I had just had the second child with my new husband. I was terribly stressed with work and kids and I felt like my husband and I were on two separate pages and I began to resent him. He was controlling and possessive and I began to say the same things ""You're not my dad"" ""don't tell me what to do"" ""im a professional I go to work I make good money don't restrict my life"".... and I began to get sexual and unfortunately I was working in juvenile corrections at the time and I was a woman amongst a whole lot of men.... So as you can imagine that ended badly... so my husband caught me in some bad predicaments and I ended up telling him I didn't love him and I was moving out and done. I took my kids and rented a house down by the lake in September. By Christmas I had realized I fucked up and my husband was more than willing to take me back and work on things so I moved back home. Episode 3: Husband and I had been working on our marriage I was being really restricted at this point because he couldn't trust me... I was still kind of denying my diagnosis so I never brought that up to him and he just thought I was a terrible no good lying cheating person... so he kept very good tabs on me and asked me a lot of fucking questions and it got old really fast... so some summer time.... I began feeling great increased sexual drive defiant and making the same statements. was drinking every day smoking an eighth of weed every day rolling blunts on my way to work and smoking before during and after work to get by... it was terrible looking back on it.. I had many nights where I didn't go home I would stay with friends or ""sleep"" in my car... I had about 4 police contacts that summer I could have easily ended up with 2 DWIs I did have a harassment charge for punching someone and I had 2 welfare checks because people were so worried about my erratic behavior. I had friends and family expressing their concern for me but once again I thought everyone else was crazy and needed to leave me alone because I was successful made it to work work performance was ok and I still took care of my kids when it was my day to do so. My husband grew tired of my behavior quickly obviously... so we were talking about splitting up again...I fell so hard from this one... I ended up being caught with a belt around my neck in the garage after calling my ex to come pick up my older two kids- the other two weren't home. That's why I decided I needed treatment... I fell from the last episode in October 2018. It's now February and I usually start to trend up in the spring and I am anticipating it. I have trended my timeline and disease symptoms... I have red flags in place with my loved ones. One of them is wanting to drink... I haven't drank since September- and I know when I start to want to drink is not a good sign... but anyway ive been thinking about drinking.... and I haven't said anything to anyone because I guess I am trying to convince myself that I can..I'm also starting to resent my husband again... he's controlling and manipulative and I don't think he understands my illness and he holds things against me... during my manic episodes everything is spinning out of control so fast that I can recall certain events but to put a timeline I really cant... like I know I did something but I don't know where it fits in and some minute details that's hard for him to accept. he thinks im withholding information from him or lying.. and I can only tell him the same thing so many times before it's just maddening to me...

I have no support system and no one to talk this out with to figure out what I should do.*&amp;#x200B;Backstory:I lost my job at the beginning of January. That (on top of things that I was already dealing with and at the time I was unmedicated) I ended up flipping my sh\*t and ended up in the mental health unit for a week. During that week they got me medicated with Lamictal and Latuda stabilized and finally I was discharged with a follow up appointment with a pdoc already scheduled for me. The problem is that my insurance ran out at the end of January. I currently have no job (not for a lack of trying I just bomb the interviews horribly) and no way to pay for a doctor's visit and my local resources can't do anything for me for a couple of months due to lack of openings through my county's community services board (I don't know what the term is for other places but this is set up to handle mental health stuff for uninsured or under insured people). My awesome therapist decided to keep seeing me even though the insurance is now cancelled and my primary doctor is going to work with me to get me taken care of as well. My therapist the pdoc in the hospital and my primary care doc have all advised me against going back to work right now and are urging me to seek temporary disability benefits as they all feel that I need a year or two to get back to a functioning level and I hated to admit it but I agree with them because I am completely unable to handle leaving my house most of the time now days. They all told me to go to social services and apply for Medicaid so that I can keep going to the doctor which I am working on as well as trying to figure out how to get disability. I have no insurance or money to pay for a pdoc appointment (first appointment as a new patient is base priced at $300) and medications; the Lamictal I can get without insurance for around $15 while the Latuda is about $1500. The makers of Latuda offer a discount program themselves but it's only up to $600 which still leaves me about $900 to pay out of pocket so that does me no good.In the meantime I have no idea how to get my medications refilled and I know that I can't just stop taking them.The pdoc in the hospital said the Latuda would only be for a month and then he advised that I stop the Latuda and go fully on the Lamictal 2 times a day. Of course that would ultimately be left up to the pdoc I was scheduled to see.Should I contact my primary doc and see if she will write the Rx as the pdoc said it should be be after the month of Latuda was up? Is there anything that anyone knows of that will help me get low cost or no cost help?&amp;#x200B;Thanks in advance.

46526,"How I stopped letting anxiety spirals control my life (xpost r/mentallyhealthier) I used to spend most of the day caught up in anxiety spirals. I used to fall into the trap of getting stuck in the past and beating myself up about mistakes or fretting about the way things could go wrong in the future. (There's a term for this- rumination.) The only way I've found out of this terrible habit is through mindfulness meditation.Mindfulness is paying attention in a particular way: on purpose in the present moment.Figuring this out the idea that you can live your life without reliving your life story has significantly improved my quality of life.I recently read this study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733812](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733812)The participants engaged in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction therapy and the conclusion was ""the more mindfulness meditation had been practiced the less rumination was reported at follow-up assessment."" Though the participants were in a full on 8 week course of therapy you can easily do this yourself with some effort.Basically the goal is to “decenter” from thoughts and emotions to see thoughts come and go without attaching any important truth or meaning to them.I'd recommend downloading the Headspace app it teaches this stuff in a very practical way and I found it to be very effective when I started out.",Bipolar

46542,"Loved Ones with Bipolar I am unsure if there already is a post on how to cope with loved ones with bipolar. Please let me know if there is. My husband was hospitalized about 5 months ago and it's been a roller coaster since with finding which meds work finding a permanent psychiatrist going to therapy etc. His bipolar is affecting our marriage and it's like he's completely forgotten his life skills. We are seeing a marriage counselor very soon. Right now I am the only one working but luckily I make enough for the two of us to be living okay. It just gets overwhelming when I have to literally do everything on top of working full-time. We got a puppy as an ESA which has helped tremendously. I only agreed to get the puppy to help him when I am at work and he did say he'd do most of the work of caring for the puppy but I am the one that ended up caring for the puppy a majority of the time. I grew up with no pets. He grew up with dogs his whole childhood so getting used to a dog was difficult when he just got out of the hospital. It's fine now since I've caught on quick with caring for a dog. It gets so exhausting with his mood changes. The smallest things upsets him and keeps him in a depressed/unhappy mood for awhile. For example: I was tired from work and didn't feel like going out to get food. Initially I did agree to get food but thought he was going with me but I forgot his back had been hurting all day. I got home and didn't feel like going back out. He got so upset because he was hungry and he didn't want to eat what was at home. He has zero cooking skills and will always order food or grab fast food. He doesn't like going out in public which I understand. But when he gets upset I can't do anything at all. If I go to a different room he says I don't care about him. If I want to do something to lighten the mood he tells me to stop because I am not doing it appropriately for his bipolar at the moment. When it gets too much I break down and start crying. He automatically makes me feel guilty by saying ""I'm always the bad guy. You can never do anything wrong."" Anything I say is used against me when he's upset. He somehow finds ways to twist what I say to have a different meaning.When he is back in a good mood we reflect on his behavior and how I reacted. He is reasonable when he's happy. He admits he was an asshole. I know it's his bipolar but I don't know what to do anymore and am exhausted of this endless cycle. I've told him before when he's experiencing an episode I always feel like he's gas lighting me. I honestly can't tell the difference between bipolar and gas lightining anymore with him.

Then the ""first depression"" came then again she was up with her mood and from that time the extreme swings started finally causing a 3-months long deep depressive state. So she went to psychiatrist (some professor someone reccomended her) who prescribed her some meds (idk exactly what but something more like a 1st generation lithium thing?). He told she does not need to go to the therapy as this is purely physical (like the ""chemicals in the brain"") thing not managable with therapy.At first there was a huge improvement after just two weeks and it lasted about six months of really minor swings and neutral state.But now she is back at the deep depression state and I am worried that meds are not right. I know absolutelty nothing about bipolar other than what internet taught me but I have a feeling that a) those meds might not be well-suited for her? b) she should at least try therapy?She obv does not want to go to any other doctor she kinda feels uncurable at this point and even blames herself for the state and blindly listens to the ""professor with years of experience"".

I get weird dreams and nightmares quite a lot but this one was extremely unsettling. It started off with me walking down a street in the city I live in and I could see something up ahead so I started walking towards it. When I got close enough I saw a person with a bag over their head being held in handcuffs by two men and was wearing a nightgown of some sort with “BIPOLAR” written across it. They were knocking door to door telling people to stay away from people with bipolar disorder and that they’re freaks. I started running down the street and I passed two children in a window sewing dolls (not sure what that was about but pretty creepy) and after that I woke up. Overall it was a horrifying dream and I would like to know if anyone else with bipolar disorder has had a nightmare similar to that. ,Bipolar

I also have OCD which has given me the biggest flare ups in past years. I wouldn't say I've necessarily been ""happy"" the past few years but I've been mostly okay and my biggest struggles have been with my OCD.However over the past few weeks I've start slipping deeper and deeper into depression. My last major depressive episode came in 2015 after the manic period that led me to being properly diagnosed with BP1. It all feels like it came on very suddenly and intensely and I'm having a really difficult time managing it. Right now I'm high functioning but just barely. I can make it into work (normally somewhat late but I make it there) I can force myself to shower most days make myself eat I take my meds etc. Sleep has been a problem. I fall asleep (thanks to seroquel) but I find myself waking up throughout the night often from a night terror. I know from the past that this high-functioning state can quickly devolve for me and leave me unable to do anything until the depression passes. I met with my psychiatrist last week and discussed the depression and have added on 150 mg Wellbutrin in addition to the Lamitcal Abilify and Seroquel that I take. I logically know that once the Wellbutrin begins to work I should feel at least a little better. It's just so painful right now- I'm back in the place I've been before where I feel empty and unable to enjoy even the things I love.

I don't have much work experience except working in a factory and logistics for a year. I'm heavily dependent on my mom for support. I also was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Currently I am on Seroquel 300mg Zyprexa 20mg trileptal 600mg and a Long acting injectable of Invega. I'm going to try to tell the doctor I don't need three antipsychotics to functuionI said some really obscene things while I was hospitalized and if I had done (which I did not do thankfully) those things while in psychosis I probably would been put in jail or prison. The reason why I decompensated so bad was because I titrated too fast off of Seroquel and started to become extremely delusional. I'm really unsure what I can do with my life job wise. I feel like I'm 100 percent disabled on so much medication. I just want my life back and I dunno if I can take back what I was saying to the nurses and psychiatrist..

46602,"Faking Sorry if I rant but I don't know why people never seem to take me seriously. I've been accused before of exaggerating. And my moods being a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"". Early on I was diagnosed multiple times with depression and anxiety. Because 75% of my mania is comprised of mixed/dysphoria. I get very moody. The only question anyone ever asked was ""do you spend a lot of money"" and when I was younger I didn't have the money to spend 20000$ even if I wanted to. Anything else -anger excessive energy no sleep etc- was labelled anxiety or agitated depression. Whenever I disagreed -and rightly so- ""professionals"" thought I was just vying for a bipolar diagnosis. Despite my reactions to the antidepressants they always insisted on. The only way I got properly treated was after a case of road rage.Years later I struggle with the fear of being accused of faking. I can see it in their faces. And at times I'm afraid that I'm actually faking. It's been really taking a toll on me lately. 2018 was a year of relapse for me and again with an empty bank account I'm faced with having to ""prove it"". Right now I feel like I should stop taking all of my meds and embrace whatever my brain gives me maybe I'll be blessed with some euphoric mania. I feel sick. I hate myself. Screw all of them....The point was to ask if anyone has felt this way/been treated this way. Even if no one answers I just need to let it out somewhere...",Bipolar

I was self harming and I ended up being suicidal and basically almost worthless as I couldn’t do anything but sit in bed and sleep. I had my meds adjusted 3 times and once my pdoc added Seroquel to the mix everything changed. I feel stable I sleep well and wake up rested I feel good overall. Not manic good but normal good.The problem is I developed a certain routine.I do almost the same thing everyday. I can finally cook clean the house work and function like I’m supposed to. But I’m scared of anything that threatens to break my routine - like going out having friends over etc. I managed to stop taking naps because I no longer feel mentally drained.

46607,"needing validation ive never posted on this subreddit before because i am not officially diagnosed bipolar but i went from MDD to an unspecified mood disorder in less than a year. some bg: im a college sophomore. the first time i ever went to therapy was march of last year. i started lamictal in december. growing up mental illness was just not a thing to my parents so i never saw any doctor or pdoc.basically ive had to do and learn everything myself regarding mental illness and treatment. but i think im reaching a burnout. the lamictal is great however my focus issues which ill just address as ADHD (i have vivid memories of almost never sleeping during pre-school nap time and instead lifting up our bed mats with my legs and ive heard my mom say she has it) are still something i don't have treatment for.not being diagnosed with anything as a kid has made this journey incredibly difficult especially concering ADHD. while ive improved drastically since freshman year (i had a debilitating depressive episode where i ended up with a 0.8 GPA) i haven't made progress with the ADHD. last friday i went to an ADHD screening for testing at my school's psych services office as im required to have the school's insurance anyways. it was the most discouraging experience.i told the woman that ive had focus issues and homework issues for as long as i can remember. i told her exactly what my thoughts would be like in a class my horrible sleep quality my difficulties around getting my work done etc. i talked to her about the very recent development regarding my mood disorder.she told me that she thinks what i was describing is related to other issues which were ""out of their scope"" and recommended me to a doctor who has a semester long waitlist for full psychological testing. which would be at least $400 $4000 if i didnt have insurance. last semester i dealt with ADHD by meeting with a professor every week to go over assignments. i got accommodations from a few classes even without being registered with disability services. however that's not 100% the case with all my classes this semester. i was struggling before that screening but now im struggling even more. i have a test tomorrow morning i have not studied for not to mention i did not do at all an essay assignment and i havent done the workbook pages due by the test. i had to ask for an extension for a paper in another class the night before because i hadn't even written it. ive missed meetings and work.that friday night i tried to find coke. sunday night i took 5 shots at 1am. monday i bought adderall and took 3/4 of it and ive never taken adderall before. i have not done anything but stay in bed because the thought of even trying to tackle my immense amount of work is so overwhelming. i know it takes a while to get a diagnosis but like i said i am feeling so burnt out. how many more doctors do i have to see? how many more episodes do i have to go through and other self-destructive behaviour? my family is no help either my father threatened to not pay my tuition when he found out i was taking meds and refused to tell him. the rest are just invalidating. i don't know what to do or figure out what i need to find out. i am so tired of not having anything. my chest literally hurts and im curled up in bed in the dark crying. im sorry this is so long but ive never had the chance or resource to really talk about this stuff honestly that im just letting it all out now. im just desperate for some reassurance and validation at the very least.",Bipolar

I'm in therapy once a week and I see my psychiatric nurse once a month. My OB is okay with me taking lamictal I'd it is helping me which was a relief as I was scared I was going to fave judgement and have to advocate hard for myself.

I'm craving coffee again I want a pack of cigarettes my driving habits are slipping into unsafe behaviors and I'm picking fights and arguments...all which are my known mania symptoms. I'm sure there are more I'm just unaware of and I've suspected an episode was coming on as soon as my sleep became troublesome though I wanted to brush that off as 2nd trimester energy boosts but it's clearly more than that. My therapist gave me a whole packet of stuff to help me calm my senses and not agitate myself more which I guess will be helpful but I'm so so so scared. I'm not going to give in to the symptoms if I can help it I'm definitely not going to pick up smoking again and will actively remove myself from the temptation but I'm just so worried because this could go so many different ways and I feel more like a fish out of water than I've ever felt in my life.

46619,"Tired of mania and I just want it to stop I’ve been in a mixed episodes I guess since around December with about a month of hypomania preceding it. Right now I feel stable but I’m all over the place. I was switched from latuda to vraylar in December and my doctor added 1 mg klonopin up to 2x a day and 100 mg trazodone. My meds I’m still on and was on before is 500mg depakote 3x a day lexapro 5 mg and temazepam 30 mg. So I’m on a lot of meds and I was putting a lot of faith into trying this vraylar since it’s supposed to treat mixed episodes and some of my symptoms have dissipated or gone away like I’m not as physically and mentally agitated and my thoughts have slowed a bit but I’m still having these outbursts of rage where I feel completely out of control and aggressive and then I feel shame and embarrassment because I have no impulse control when and leading up to these outbursts and before. I had to move back home with my mom a couple weeks ago because I quit/was sort of pushed out of my job in December because my episode was escalating and I couldn’t manage my caseload. My boss was a social worker and said she’d call me in January to see if I was ready to come back to work and she never did so I just figure that my job I’ve built my career around is now just obsolete because of my circumstances for leaving. I blew all my savings in December and January by going on a trip to Vegas and then other stupid shit. I’m not hearing things anymore like I was but my thoughts are disorganized and I’m not sure if my thinking is accurate. I ruined most of my relationships with people within a few weeks in December so I’ve been isolating myself from the people I do know but I still keep putting myself in not-so-ideal circumstances with people I don’t really know or really care to be around if it weren’t for the impulse to do some of these things. I don’t know why I can’t control this. The klonopin and trazodone aren’t cutting it for sleep. I’m supposed to use the klonopin and temazepam and trazodone together but apparently there’s been a shortage of temazepam so I haven’t been able to fill that since early December.My therapist and psychiatrist have been trying to keep me out of the hospital but I’m starting to feel crappy and just kind of weak feeling. I cry nearly everyday which is very abnormal for me and I feel like I can’t eat so my body’s starting to feel like shit. My therapist brought up the prospect of ECT today. I’m 25 and the thought that I’m already having to escalate to even having that kind of conversation was terrifying to me. I know it has advanced over the years but it’s still kind of scary. She also said if I don’t seem better next week she’s probably going to hospitalize me. I’m so exhausted from it all and tired of going several nights with no sleep that I don’t care anymore but I think that means I probably don’t need to go then.

In 2017 I was told that they have misdiagnosed me and I am bipolar with insomnia and anxiety. I was told that my medication is very important to keep me regulated and without it could be dangerous for my life. I refuse to take the medication because of the feeling zoned out like a zombie incapacitated and no ambition. The breakup I experienced in 2017 seemed to have an impact on my mental health causing me to have rages of anger and outbursts verbally and physically (breaking things throwing and punching anything). Recently I have been going through overwhelming troubling events that caused me to lose everything facing homelessness out of my control no family support no job no money pushed away friends and no where to go. The person that I've been dating could relate to having bipolar and understand but I managed to destroy it. Rages are heightened and outburst increasing. I've done something that brought me so much shame embarrassment and shock. Two days ago on Instagram I uploaded seven videos of me and in those videos I was having a manic tantrum attack. At that moment and in the mindset I was in didn't realize that I just showed my mental illness for the world to see I just snapped. My inbox and notifications were sounding off rapidly like a person ring the doorbell. I snapped out of that trans and watched the videos and I immediately removed them. I turned my phone off for the day. Throughout the day my mania were in and out and I haven't slept since that day. Well this is who I am and wanted to share. Thanks!,Bipolar

Like not even hypomania mania.Today I did the same but I could only get my hands on normal street amphetamines I snorted around 0.3g of it on different occasions between 07:00 and 13:30 where I snorted 0.2g. The effect should wear off around 21:30. Should I expect the same thing?I am very careful when it comes to this and I know it's a bad idea just talking about the substance itself. But how bad is this could this lead to developing bipolar I? I had a much worse deppressive period during autumn than I usually do. The same duration but worse and it led to drug/alkohol problems when I first started ssri without mood stabilizers.I am certain this period was because the stimulant even though I only used it twice during spring when I didn't have any medication. But could this be remedied by just using this substance every couple of month and keeping my regular medications?",Bipolar
46633,"Just started Lithium. Bipolar II. Looking for others experiences and advice as I’m feeling very anxious. Hi guys. Long time lurker of this sub so I know you all are kind and give good advice. I just started 450mg of the extended release type of Lithium last night. I took it after a meal but by the time it hit my stomach I had really bad nausea. I went and laid down and after about 30 mins that passed thankfully. I woke up during the night quite thirsty and today I have been drinking plenty of water. I have been feeling dizzy at times have been sweaty - sometimes hot flashes and then feel cold later. Hands and feet sweating a lot. Also I am feeling very anxious (there is a lot going on in my life so that would make sense but I wasn’t anxious this badly and in this way before the lithium). I feel ‘out of it’ too - like dissociated maybe - the anxiety makes this scary although I am in a rational state of mind. I also have a feeling of just being a bit unwell in some hard to define way. I feel a icky lolI have no symptoms of toxicity at all thankfully. No shakes. However searching reddit and Google I can’t kind anyone reporting anxiety dizziness and feeling slightly out of it and unwell. I know it is early days and I might need to adjust but after hours of obsessive Googling and worry I just need some feedback as to whether what I am feeling is normal or not? I am also on Lamictal 200mg but have been for many months already. I was on 25mg Seroquel since the Friday before last to help with sleep but my last dose of that was Saturday night. I stopped it as it wasn’t helping me sleep and I was getting no benefit.If anyone has some experience with lithium I’d really appreciate some reassurance. Especially regarding the feeling of not quite being here or right in some way. Thank you ???? ",Bipolar

46636,"Doctor is forcing me to come off Depakote because I am a 'woman of childbearing age'. She knows I have an IUD and do not want kids but insists despite my protests. I feel totally enraged and dehumanised. I have recently moved back to the UK (specifically London) after having attended university in the US. This is important because the two countries have different rules regarding prescription medications. It was in the US that I received my bipolar diagnosis and started treatment. When I first moved back my GP was happy to renew all my prescriptions from the US so I do currently have enough Depakote to last me a few months but he also referred me to a new psychiatrist. I met with her for the first time yesterday and she said that in the UK they do not prescribe Depakote to women of childbearing age because it can cause birth defects and she would not be able to keep me on as a patient if I were to continue to take it. I'm on a lot of medications for a multitude of health conditions and it took months of painful trial and error to find a drug for bipolar that didn't give me unbearable side effects and also played nice with my other medications. Finally finding Depakote was the best thing that happened to me. I really don't want to go through the pain of finding a new drug all over again. Especially as I've recently been through some trauma (coming out of an emotionally abusive relationship) and am worried how the instability of coming off and on medications might impact me. What makes me the most angry about all of this is that this would not be an issue if I were a man. I do not want kids and of this I have been certain since I was a child. I have an IUD in place the most effective form of birth control and moreover since breaking up with my ex I have only dated women (I'm bisexual) so I don't foresee an unplanned pregnancy occurring in the near future. My psychiatrist knows all of this but apparently at 25 I am too young to know what I want or have agency over my own body and my mental health is less important than the wants of some hypothetical future baby-wanting husband. I feel truly disgusted like I've been reduced to a walking womb. I desperately wanted to scream at her but I need to hold out at least for one more appointment because I'm almost out of Ritalin (also have ADHD) and she's the only doctor I can get in to see and prescribe it before I run out. She was deliberately vague about what the 'rules' are surrounding this and if another psychiatrist would be allowed to prescribe it to me or not. My pharmacist certainly had no issues giving it to me after I said I had an IUD. Has anyone else been through this and know what the rules are? Anyone on here a woman in the UK who has successfully been prescribed Depakote? If anyone has a London (ideally zone 1/2) based psych that does will you message me their name (private sector doc is fine)? I'm really at a loss of what to do but I feel like she's not the right psychiatrist for me long term if she's so rigid about these antiquated sexist standards. ",Bipolar

46638,"I Am a Colorful Portrait of Bipolar ADHD Anxiety Trichotillomania Insomnia and Binge Eating and I Need Advice I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar a month ago. At the age of 13 I was diagnosed with ADHD Trichotillomania anxiety insomnia and a binge eating disorder. I didn't seek medication until I was 18 as my family refused me any meds. In which I was placed on Adderall and Xanax. After 3 years my body began to digest it differently causing constant need to have my meds adjusted until he suggested Vyvanse. Xanax never needed to be adjusted nor did I experience addictive side effects. My doctor would take me off of Xanax to see if I experienced and adverse effects. With Vyvanse I was able to focus avoid binge eating all together without any issues maintaining a normal diet. My mood swings were gone I was even able to sleep normally as once the meds wore off I was tired and ready for bed by 9:30amNow with my new diagnosis of Bipolar which came apparent when mania appeared out of nowhere once I stopped taking Vyvanse when waiting for new insurance due to moving out of state (the meds are expensive as hell at 200 bucks) My doctor now has me on Lamictal(100mg) for depression Seroquel(50mg) for my mania and Insomnia and Hydroxyzine(50mg) for my anxiety. My mania and depression are gone although these meds do nothing for my anxiety. I am still dealing with the mood swings I often experienced with adhd. I am quickly irritable or angry over the smallest things. No attention to anything..(like I stopped writing this post 3 times lmao) no motivation and I am back to binge eating. I have asked my doctor to allow me back on my Vyvanse in which he has told me no until my mood stabilizes. It has and then he has told me my mania may happen with Vyvanse even tho he stated this med carries a small risk due to the way it metabolizes. I have never experienced mania during Vyvanse and I am so worried about my binge eating symptoms in which I have gained 60 pounds since last October and my lack of attention and along with my impulse issues. I see my psychiatrist again today and I am wondering if I should insist that I am placed back on my adhd meds as a trial run? I have tried most non-stimulants such as Concerta which just led to me being even more exhausted than I normally am atm. Any advise would be appreciated &lt;3Thank you in advance ",Bipolar
46639,Been a hypomanic mess lately So the majority of the past month I’ve been feeling depressed and out of it. Not really talking to anyone and just hiding in my room and then after a few good news and change of events I started to feel better. I finally felt hopeful and felt like myself again only to realize that it was all a lie. That I wasn’t actually feeling better and just pivoting into a hypomanic state. I went from feeling good and organized to realizing I wasn’t eating or sleeping much being incredibly impulsive getting pulled over for speeding at my job flipping out on friends and telling them off and over all feeling like my skin is made of electricity if that makes any sense. I just can’t find a balance these days. Now I called out of work mid shift cause I wasn’t eating much and just feeling sick and shakey and now I’m worried that I might loose my job. I can’t seem to find a middle ground. I just wish I could breath for once. I hate not being able to trust my feelings and the days I feel good I only end up finding out that my good feelings weren’t good and just manic.

I had a what I'm assuming was a panic attack the other night cause I've only ever felt this sensation when I think really hard about some kind of medical condition I probably don't have. My vision went blurry and my ears were hissing. I remember fumbling with my breathing while wondering wtf was happening. I started taking deep breaths after figuring I might be having a panic attack. I ignored all my emotionally rooted thoughts and calmed myself down. Fuck. That. Shit. I feel for anyone who goes through anything like that regularly.

She's expressed since finalizing our divorce how she feels she messed up and turned her back on me when I was simply severely depressed.

46648,"Bipolar 1 doesn’t seem to cover it anymore. Schizoaffective anybody? I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 &amp; C-PTSD (repetitive childhood trauma and abuse) 4 years ago. Mainly after a severe 6mo. Long manic episode in which I was convinced I was indestructible and a direct channel of god resulting in multiple unintended near death experiences related to drugs alcohol and physical safety. Long story short “bipolar” in itself has been one hell of a show. Since my first severe episode I have experienced a multitude of smaller shorter lived episodes 2 out of 4 which would probably even fall in the hypomanic category. The depression always lasts much longer (usually 2/3X times longer than the initial mania) but it never comes with out visual &amp; auditory hallucinations explosive anger psychosis and catatonic moments lasting no less than 3 hours at a time. I’m 21 years old. The lines are starting to get blurry. I don’t know where the episodes end and begin. I am scared as fuck and have had a handful of clarity moments that reveal the way my brain seems to be slipping through my fingers. I tried to tapper off my lithium (my doc is on board) thinking that much of this time spent somewhere else / staring at a wall only to snap back a few hours later confused as to where the time went - was just because of my high dose of 1250mg lithium carbonate. I’ve tapered down to 300mg at night and 300mg in the morning and my partner has started to point out that I seem to exhibit ALL symptoms of bipolar each day simultaneously and more consistently.

I said no because I don't think that this disorder will affect my medical judgement. Anyway I will take time off before it gets to that point.

46660,"DEPRESSION HAS A PURPOSE: HOW TO USE IT RIGHT This text discusses personal experiences with depression and suicidal tendencies.It is an amended and an updated version. I edited it for mistakes and added a couple of paragraphs alongside with real-life illustrations. If you have already read the first version just look for the new paragraphs. Thank you for reading.I think I know now why I need depressive phases.By saying that I don't mean the physical side of depression. This implies fatigue general exhaustion increased or decreased need for sleep the same applies to appetite drop in libido decrease in hygiene and general activities. The body needs to recover. It takes time.What I am talking about is the emotional intellectual — if you want — spiritual side of depression. I think I found a purpose of depression on the other side of the coin.It appears that I grow during these times because I reflect a lot on the recent events critically evaluate my actions and decisions as well as my reasoning behind them. Most importantly I try to understand my mistakes and to learn lessons from them so that I will never repeat them again.In all fairness it is a painful and self-destructive process. Most of the time it is counterproductive and worsens the state of an affected person with ever increasing speed. It is a vicious circle of being paralyzed feeling ashamed of it and guilty for own disengagement inability to find enough energy to at least do things that you generally like (normally it’s worse: you completely lost interest in the things you like) being paralyzed from shame and guilt hating yourself for this lameness becoming ever more disgusted by your own bad smell and a total disaster on the floor and in the kitchen feeling dizzy and weak at all times having a hurting back and ass cheeks from spending days in bed losing all respect for yourself and hope for improvement wanting to give up and to end the pain.You are a burden. You are a disgrace. You are worthless. You have no purpose. Your existence does not make any sense. You are a waste of resources. You are a disappointment. Your parents must be ashamed of you. They should regret bringing you to the world. You will never produce anything meaningful. You will never change anything. You mean nothing. You are a lab rat in the obstacle race in an endless labyrinth. You were born a slave to the indifferent capitalist feudalistic world system. You will never find your place in the society. All spots are occupied. Even the untouchable ones. But you are nothing special. You don’t even have the guts to slip down the social ladder and join the untouchables in protest against the system. “Fuck the system” remains just a graffiti on the platform of a subway station. You are a fucking joke.This is an approximation of the thinking patterns typical of a depressive episode. They dance in circles in your head every day. They hold hands and take turns in solo parts. They exhaust you. You wake up with them and you go to sleep with them. You cry when you fall asleep. You cry when you wake up. Day after day.Slowly you develop a real anxiety for answering phone calls. They terrify you. People want something from you. We don’t want that. Opening the mail box becomes a real nightmare. You spend days pursuaiding yourself to open your mail account or to open your post box. You stop answering text messages. You are tired of lying that you are doing fine. You are not fine.During the depression I take a pause of silence. I cut my connections to the outer world and go inside myself. I need that time free of background noises and external advice to keep hearing my thoughts. This is the time when I re-evaluate my knowledge and values. Regarding this three semi-cool metaphors come to my mind.Winter treeDepression looks like a tree in a night of winter sleep. That very deep and dreamless slumber. Though how would we know? They might as well watch nightmares which could compete with the Saw or I spit on your grave. It is sad and does not bring joy to anyone. To some it might even look ugly. Sometimes decomposing fall foliage that cover the decaying human and animal feces with a soft fluffy coat smell bad. I mean really bad. You better keep on moving.The tree stops interacting with the surrounding life. Birds abandoned their nests and no longer sing on its branches. It lost all its leaves and stays alone for the rest of the winter. It might appear that it is cold or dead. It is winter that makes its skin harden and darken. It becomes raw and thick.Or we could look at it differently. Winter can be beautiful. I love winter. It is my favorite season. In Germany winter is usually gray and wet. The wind is brutal you don’t want to go outside. The gray sky weighs heavy on your head. You are cold.On those days I often must think of winter in Russia. With a nostalgic smile and a sharp wrench in my heart I see my way home my parents’ house a rare artifact of Russian wooden architecture that survived the Revolution of 1917 on a peaceful winter night. The sky was beautifully painted in the darkest and deepest blue. Twinkling stars were magically winking at me. The way home from the bus stop was a thin stamp white trail in the snow. It lied between two snowbanks as high as your knees. Tiny snow flakies sparkled in the soft orange light of the lanterns along the road. Like in a slow motion the snow was falling on my palms and in my mouth in huge fluffy flakies. It was Christmas magic. No vehicles were driving by. It was so silent that the only sound that sent waves into the space was crispy and squeaky snow under my heavy winter boots. I was the happiest I could be. Inevitably the spring comes. And the tree that was asleep just yesterday wakes up and gets more beautiful than ever. It gives birth to fresh crispy-green leaves it grows more branches which are strong and flexible. The new ones make the tree bigger and older.It hosts more nests and attracts more birds to sing on its branches in the early morning when the sun rises. It amazes more people they enjoy being around the tree. People go outside and spend time in its shadow. They arrange pick-nicks under its thick coat of leaves laugh eat and take pictures. More animals and kids play on the tree’s branches. Some might even build a small cabin on them which will become a young kid’s secret escape into the magical world of their dreams.In Russia they have a tradition of hugging a tree. It is believed that the tree would suck up all of the negativity and charge you with positive energy. Many people even have their special tree which suits their personality. Some prefer the pine tree others the oak tree. Lime trees and birches are popular as well.Then the fall approaches. The facade starts cracking the leaves are falling off. Everything is getting browner and rainier. Slowly everyone left the tree behind. Birds headed off south to have a sex-vacation people are running from box to box hiding under an umbrella. It's winter again.Current view from from kitchenLast spring I had a crazy idea that I can be an artist. So in a creative madness I decorated the only tree in our backyard with pieces of my old linen. And then died it with acrylic paint. I conceptualized it as a memory tree. Because my linen kept memories of nearly everything and outlived a lot of relationships and tragedies. Now my roommate says it is the only thing that reminds him of joy in the whole backyard.Computer gameDepression is like a progressing computer game. You need to die so many times until you learn the lesson and get to the next level.Sometimes when the level is hard it gets frustrating and exhausting at some point. You lose interest and give up on the game. And when you do that you stop playing the game and stop unlocking the next levels. That's a metaphor of the suicide.Suicide is the worst possible side-effect of mental illnesses. It should rightfully be taken seriously.Real suicideLast summer a fellow member from the self-help group which I regularly visit jumped off a roof. She left two kids behind. She was young and had a special outlook on the world which she lived in photography. She had been deeply depressed since March when I saw her for the first time which was the first time I visited a group meeting.In the flash round she cried. She said she could not bear it anymore that she just wanted to give up. I felt that. I felt her pain. I knew too well those two sentences. There comes a time when only those two are left. And you just cry and say them over and over again. I wanted to give her a warm hug and to let her cry on my shoulder. But we didn't know each other. So I had to restrain.At the end of May she committed suicide. It shook deeply the whole group. It became so apparent that this is how the game ends for us. Many of us were deeply grieving.Up to 17% of people with bipolar disorder will take their lives as a result of their illness making it the #1 cause of premature death in people with this disorder. Women attempt suicide about 3 times more often than men although men are 4 times as likely to complete suicide. People with bipolar disorder are 2x more likely to attempt suicide than someone with a unipolar disorder. In a review of deaths of individuals with bipolar disorder from 1936-1988 19% of 9389 deaths were found to be because of suicide.

I was late because it had taken me quite a time to choose the right black shirt and trousers. Dresses seemed too festive to me. I was nervous it was my first funeral in Germany. It was my first suicide funeral. It was my first mental health funeral.The chapel was crowded. I stood leaning on the cold wooden door. I breathed heavily and needed time to process. I had never seen so many people attending a funeral. Those are small and private in Russia unless you are some kind of famous or rich. I counted some 250 people. All grieving. Some crying.Speeches were boring and long. Also swampy and sticky. I was outraged when the priest said ""We cannot know why [she] left. It will remain a mystery forever."" I wanted to scream. I wanted to scream so loud so that he would stop talking. How dare you say that we don't know why she jumped off the roof? How dare you indifferently pass the verdict that it will remain a mystery? I wanted to scream. Or to leave the chapel and slam the door.But I couldn't leave. I needed to stay. I owed it to her. I started crying. I couldn't stop. Tears ran in deep rivers down my cheeks. I didn't have a napkin. I couldn't bear the ceremony but I couldn't go either.In the chapel across the columns her family hung out on a string her photographs for the visitors to take away as a memory of her. I waited for most people to take one and leave the chapel. By the time I came up to the string with hanging photographs I only had three left to choose from. I picked a very bleak image of a closed backyard probably taken from a balcony on some fourth floor on a clouded winter day. It was bleak. Like depression that kills us. I took it to remember this.The weather outside was good and sunny. It seemed totally out of place in the given context. The sun brutally burned my shoulders in the black shirt. I hate the sun. I hate everything when there is the sun. It blinds me makes me sweaty and hot and gives me headaches. Also it burns my skin. So no reason to love it. As I stood in line to throw my flower into the grave I spent my time hating the sun. In that moment I didn't realize how much this day would impact me. Her name was Verena.DepressionDirectly after the funeral I fell into the deepest darkest and the coldest well of depression. None of the previous episodes could come close to this one in severity. I was tired I was failing on all fronts. I had ten days left to write my master's thesis after which I had to go to Russia for three weeks — I deserved a vacation. I had been in a manic phase when I invited my then-partner's mom to come to visit Russia with me. Also I didn't know how I was going to pay my bills. Verena's death was the trigger.When it became clear that I would not be able to finish my thesis before the deadline and that I needed an extension it was too late to cancel the trip. Christoph's (my ex) mom had already made all the reservations. I didn't want to go there. I had a bad feeling. I wanted to stay home and close off myself from the angry cruel world. But I rarely change plans. So I went.I arrived in Moscow already at my worst. The first thing that I did upon arrival was buying a battery of alcoholic beverages and red bull cans to keep me going. This way I was going to write my thesis and to finish it by August 3rd. Good plan destined for success.I worked but much more I drank smoked and had severe headaches. A bad state to write your thesis. My next step was to keep myself awake by the cocktail vodka red bull with a lot of vodka and a lot of red bull. Three all-nighters four cigarette packs. I came forward. But the body never forgives.Then Christoph's mother came. For a whole week I needed to guide to entertain and to translate for her. She was nearly helpless without me. She didn't know the language people often didn't speak English and she wasn't very well at that either. Most importantly she couldn't plan her program by herself. And she needed company by nearly any activity she undertook. A rich touristic program requires to get up early and to go to bed late. I was getting exhausted. I gave out all my energy even the emergency generator. Burned all calories. No spoons left.I still needed to finish my thesis. So again all-nighters again red bull. With the only difference: I increasingly preferred watching TV shows over writing the thesis. And I couldn't wake up. I turned into a horrible host and an indifferent individual. I could not wait for her to leave. A shameful thought but I could not ban it from my thinking feed. I was anticipating my trip to Saint Petersburg the time in a summery St. Petersburg which everyone is talking about. I wanted to fall in love with St. Petersburg too. I was excited to see Sonya my dear friend-by-coincidence. She is an architecture enthusiast and gives brilliant city tours.Instead I locked myself up in her room for the whole week of my stay. I only came out of the room to either visit the bathroom or smoke a cigarette. Much more seldom it was because of the food. I was starving. Worse I was deadly afraid to go outside. I was afraid of people and public space. I went outside only to buy cigarettes or alcohol only at night and only in Sonya's company.What was I doing behind the closed doors the whole week? I was watching a TV show. Over and over again. Until I exhaust myself and pass out. Sometimes Sonya forced me to work on my thesis and I did. But more often I watched TV series not wrote my thesis. In this fashion I spent my last week before the deadline.I failed. Self-explanatory. I went to my psychiatrist and first thing cried a quarter hour. I was the worst failure in the history of failures. He gave me a sick leave until the end of October. I had time to crawl out of the deep stinky rabbit hole I had accidentally fallen into. _____________So back to the pink fluffy unicorns: I for example like to play Two Dots. It's an endless game which gets ever more complicated. Being depressed I spent hours solving new problems and trying to unlock a new level. Eventually I would give up and even delete the app from my phone. But then occasionally I would install it again and start it all over. Because deleting the app did not kill the small worm who wants salvation from unresolved problems.Lighthouse stairsLastly depression is like a brief stop on the endless stairs leading to the top of a lighthouse. You take upon this torture because of the view that it rewards you with in the end. The way up there is at times unbearable and brutal to your lungs and leg muscles. The space is tight and the air is bad.Normally the stairs are also crowded af if we take a tower in a city hall or a cathedral. So taking a short breath break is like a lottery. When you do get a chance you would bow putting your hands on your knees. You breathe heavily and your face is red. You get no air your lungs hurt your leg muscles are sore. Looking either up or down makes you dizzy and your feet sweat with tiny ice-cold drops.In that moment you question your sanity in deciding to punish yourself with these stairs. You now see the promised view in relation to your suffering. You re-evaluate the price- performance ratio. And the results are not in favor of the view. But the stream of people on the stairs keeps moving. In most cases it carries you away again and again upwards.Maybe the saddest thing about this is that in most cases you barely spend ten minutes on the roof of the tower. You briefly enjoy the view. Sometimes the view is disappointing. The weather was bad gray clouds covered the city with a thick ceiling. The wind was strong and freezing. Your hair was flying around and got in your eyes and your mouth. It might be dirty and noisy upstairs. Even better if you are afraid of height. In most cases it's pretty crowdy on top. People are pushing each other trying to get the best view. No one is talking to each other.It is understandably very upsetting. You take pictures from all possible angles anyways and go downstairs. The way down seems much shorter than the way up. You easily run downstairs asking yourself whether the view was worth the trouble. You don't know.Sometimes though you might give up halfway through and turn back. Similar to the computer game wormy we have a tower wormy. Every once in a while it bites a little bit off your achievement organ and crawls inside your thinking organ. Then you forget about it only to remember again sometime later.HopeNow going back to my introduction when I wrote that during the depression I try to understand my mistakes and to learn lessons from them so that I will never repeat them again.In manic phases which in my case normally follow depressive episodes I challenge myself to act upon my new knowledge and imperatives. I need to do that to prove myself that I learned the lesson and deserve redemption.I am my strongest critic. I need to forgive myself to move on not the forgiveness of the others. I pass my own judgment on my actions. Because I know best all my motifs and thoughts. And before I ultimately forgive myself I ask for forgiveness people that I hurt. Not formally to check the box but genuinely and humbly.NB! I did not intend to romanticize depression with these metaphors or worse to implicate that I have the cure to depression. Depression is a serious brutal disease that tragically changes people's lives and sometimes ends them. Therefore I do not recommend terminating your prescription meds if you are affected by depression or other mental health issues. I take a bunch of those on a daily basis. However I do not propagate for taking medication either. Whatever works for you best is best for your health. Invest time into exploring those ways. It always pays off.If you are affected by depressionIf you are affected by depression allow yourself time to recover. My former therapist used to say: ""If you want to lie on the couch lie on the couch"". That's the best advice I can give you. When you are well you won't lie on the couch anyways. Take your time. There is no hurry when it comes to health.Second advice is to start slow and small. Make your bed. It's challenging enough. Don't be ashamed of feeling like taking a shower or doing laundry (because you have nothing left to wear) is Mount Everest (or Mount Weather rofl). It's okay. All people with depression share this mess and this shame. I think we should talk about this more to support each other. So again start small. Make your bed. It's enough.Third thing your depression procrastination pays off. Hundreds if not thousands of hours that I spent on YouTube watching beauty tutorials BuzzFeed videos and in-depth analyses of each Game of Thrones’ episode eventually make up for the wasted time. At some point you'll be able to connect the dots and turn that Netflix binge madness into something meaningful.Lastly if you have suicidal thoughts get help immediately. Tell people about this. Tell themhow you feel. Don’t be silent. They care. Get any help that’s available and acceptable to you: medical religious anonymous hotline support group parents friends — anything will do. However suicidal tendencies without a doubt qualify for a good reason to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. This is how I got diagnosed. I needed to get suicidal first to notice that something is not right.If you are close to an affected personIf you are close to an affected person give them time. Recovery is a gradual process. Be patient and supportive. They know that they have problems with hygiene that their room looks like an aftermath of the nuclear war that they haven't done the dishes in weeks. It's alright. If you can help them. If you can't leave them. Time will come when they get up and do all the dishes and laundry in one go.Here the spoon theory is a great illustration of this particular face of depression (shoutout to Anja Osypova). It is a metaphor that isused to explain the reduced amount of mental and physical energy available for activities of living and productive tasks that may result from disability or chronic illness. The term spoons are a visual representation used as a unit of measure in order to quantify how much energy a person has throughout a given day. It was coined by Christine Miserandino in 2003 in her essay The Spoon Theory. According to her theory each activity requires a given number of spoons which will only be replaced as the person ""recharges"" through rest. A person who runs out of spoons has no choice but to rest until their spoons are replenished. However people with chronic diseases [...] and various disabilities may have sleep difficulties. This can result in a particularly low supply of spoons. (Ctrl+C Ctrl+V from Wikipedia)I hear people call each other tenderly spoony. I think it's cute. So love your spoony they can be adorable.My former partner Christoph used to literally drag me out of bed every day when I was at my lowest. He woke me up with the best good morning YouTube playlist and started by shaking all my body parts. It was very funny and so I started my day with a smile. Then he asked me what I wanted to wear. In most cases I said ""Dragon. I wanna be a dragon."" So he went into my room and brought the dragon socks and slippers. He took one foot out of the blanket and stroke it. Then he put a sock on it. When he was done with the second foot he would start putting the dragon on me while I was still lying flat. Anyway it was funny. I laughed a lot. Next he would put me straight up and finish dressing me up as a dragon. I was ready to start a new day.Tell them that you love them and that you believe in them. You might need to repeat it everyday. It is crucial to regularly give the person in depression encouraging affirmation and to cheer them up. On most days in depression I cry at least once a day. I feel hopeless and worthless. I see no exit in the darkness. My partner was there to console me too. He hugged me let me cry into his shirt and told me over and over again what I achieved and that I can do more.Once I was about to meet an elderly friend of mine who is usually very proud of me and thinks highly of me. I grew to perceive her appreciation as high expectations. It put a lot of pressure on me. I was afraid not to meet the standards. So this time being deep in depression I got so anxious so that I wanted to cancel the plans. Every time I thought about it I started crying and couldn't calm down. I felt like a complete failure. But canceling the plans would be a typical failure too. So I had nothing left to do but to cry.Christoph took an A4 notebook and started going through the recent months with me. He asked me what I did in March April May June July and August. Unexpectedly it turned out that I had done a lot of things and worked a lot of jobs. At least on paper. So we decided that we killed my worst enemy: I had things to tell about. My plan was to take a shower put something semi-fancy on and just force myself outside. I would just recite from the chart Christoph and I had made earlier and that would do it. Fake it till you make it.It wouldn't be me if I hadn't blown up my own plan. Soon enough into my report I got annoyed by the necessity to keep up the facade. So I told the three ladies that I felt like a piece of shit and that I had been feeling like shit for months and that I didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I told them about my disorder how I got diagnosed how long it took me to find the medication that's right for me that I went to a self-help group and that I found friends there. I felt relieved. And the ladies were again amazed by my honesty and strength. Of course I thought that I didn't deserve it but it was a huge relief nevertheless.EpilogueAs far as Christoph is concerned so that you don't think that I am the luckiest girl in the world — which I was — should be rightly noted that he broke up with me three weeks ago. He couldn't deal with my illness any longer. And I let him go because he deserves it. I am deeply grateful for the time he spent next to me feeding me off the spoon and putting the dragon on me. But I cannot force this burden on anyone.Author: Sasha Khrenova #depression #suicide #bipolarYou can find this essay on Facebook if you want to share it. It would be appropriate due to my authorship.

46661,"Feeling 'normal'... But that scares me a bit. My GP still haven't put me on mood stabilizers. I am only on Sertraline till my next appointment. Which sent me on a bad bad manic episode. My first episode which felt as real and dangerous as it could to the point I have a scar on my face because I'd cut it. That is how serious it was. I didn't spent money nor had sex I was however extremely paranoic had too much energy was hallucinating my self-esteem was sky-high... At the time it was good but now that I am back to myself... I am terrified of it. I hate it. Every moment of happiness I am scared that shit is starting again. However now I am... Fine. I am not depressed. Which I was expecting because I would always crash. I had an horrible depression that lasted 4 years and it was packed with anxiety and panic attacks... It messed me up. I didn't finish school nor do I have a job. I am a 23 yo that can't get its life right because of a crippling depression and anxiety. But for the very first time ever since my 13s (yes I had panic attacks this long) I am feeling fine. But this is scary? I am not sure if Sertraline is dealing with my depression and is doing a good job at it. But the fear of getting manic again because of Sertraline is making my anxiety peak at night. Last night I woke up 4 times because I was hearing my dad call me and then it was my mom but really they weren't saying things... It was my imagination. But while I feel fine this fear is so so bad. I always think ""am I hallucinating again?"". Thoughts like ""in a few days I will either be depressed or manic again"" makes me extremely worried. And so is my family. They are very supportive and they felt so powerless last time it scared them to death. Every time I say ""I am so happy today"" my mom asks me if I had a good night of sleep or if I am feeling like a bit high. Same for my sister and my dad. Questions like ""You okay? For real?"" is turning out to be too common. Seriously. This is the worst.",Bipolar

46663,"Where I end and bipolar begins: passion? I'm not sure when I began having bipolar symptoms. But for most of my life I've been very cyclic. I don't think I was stable for most of my adolescence. It is very scary for me to look back on my life. And think of how most of the times I really felt like MYSELF were when I was most likely manic. I used to be very goal-oriented loved to learn passionate about my hobbies. Just passionate passionate passionate.But not always. I would slip into depressive phases and either lose interest in things or stop entirely.When I think of myself I think of someone is incredibly passionate. But that doesnt describe me at all. I feel like a husk who used to be someone. I still like the same things. But I never learn or do anything anymore.I used to write essays for fun. I used to practice Japanese religiously. I used to be so passionate. The scary thing is. I think my passion and vigor was never me. It was mania.I'm scared that I was never anything but manic or depressed. I'm scared that's all I'll be. Or a husk.The only moments where I feel like myself are when I'm passionate and working hard. But I haven't felt a single flicker of that passion since I had my manic episode. I just feel blank. Sometimes depressed. Sometimes stable. Mostly bored. And I'm scared to feel passion sometimes. Because then...its mania. It must be mania. I dont know how to separate who *I* am from bipolar disorder. Is the me that I appreciate just my manic self? Is this passionless semi-depressed stay at home jobless college drop out...ME?TL;DR: My identity is being passionate being hardworking a love of learning.

My GP and psychiatrists haven’t taken this side of things seriously and it’s been going on for years. I’m 33 not employed not in education not in a relationship nothing going on in my life no motivation I struggle to focus enough even to have a conversation (I struggle to find words) I can’t focus on cleaning and don’t have the energy for it and this has been going on for years.

The GP tells me I have slight anemia (and I take iron pills) but otherwise they say nothing is wrong. I took like 2.5 milligrams of Ritalin the other day that I got from a friend after my dad berated me about not doing anything. After that I felt a little jittery but was able to get up and walk around and I even went to the gym the next two days in a row and did some basic chores around the house. I had better days than I’ve had in a really long time and didn’t really suffer any side effects (besides some initial jitters)... But I know that this is playing with fire. Before my bipolar diagnosis I had a prescribed stimulant for a while to study and while it helped me study (and clean) I also dealt with huge amounts of anxiety anger and possibly a mixed episode... (idk how I would describe it... very agitated speedy anxious angry mental state though). I’m very conflicted and confused because I need something to change for me.

I’ve been smoking weed really heavily for a few months and during my last manic episode it was giving me symptoms of psychosis like hearing voices and eventually started giving me 3 hour long panic attacks where I’m /convinced/ I’m dying. I finally decided to quit weed and threw all my weed out. I bought CBD oil at a hippy grocery store here and decided to try that since it’s literally proven to not make you intoxicated calm anxiety and there’s even studies showing it to be an antipsychotic. Last night I took it for the first time and I did feel great for the first hour or so. I was estatic that I finally found something that can help me sleep with out making me psychotic. Until I ended up having another panic attack. I became very anxious that every little ache I felt or inch I felt was a sign that I was going to drop dead from cancer anytime soon. I was shaking so hard and would stand up to do something but become so distracted that I’d just walk back and forth a few times and then lay back down in bed. I even heard voices like I usually do when I get really high on strong sativa. I honestly definitely felt high and CBD isn’t supposed to make you high at all! It’s just supposed to be like a muscle relaxer. I’m honestly so confused about why I had this reaction. I’m not manic anymore I have definitely crashed into depression and have been depressed for a week or so now. The fact that I’m not manic and *supposedly* wasn’t high when this ‘panic attack’ happened is really concerning to me? Especially because I was still hearing voices? (I say *supposedly* because since there’s not any regulation laws on CBD technically the manufacturer could leave traces of THC in it and not tell you so I guess theoretically I could have been high. But I bought really expensive CBD from a really reputable store so I’m hesitant to think that it would be spiked with THC)I don’t have any of these symptoms during the day when I’m completely sober.

If so please introduce yourself.” Me: *stands up* Hey everyone I’m pickleb1tch and I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2. I’ve been trying to manage but it’s getting hard. I’m on meds but they’re being adjusted and that’s a process. I used to love my hypomania. With the small caveat of mild insomnia loss of appetite and wanting to do everything at once thus getting nothing done it’s a pretty good time. The world seems beautiful and I feel euphoric. I become more creative and productive. Being around people makes me happy and I seek company. Conversations become more meaningful and memorable. Lately I feel as if being hypomanic contributed to me doing things “normal” me wouldn’t do. Hypomania let me feel capable and as if I mattered a bit more than I did. Think very mild delusions. Among the things I wouldn’t normally do: A friend (A) had confided in me about troubles regarding her friend (B). I hadn’t been present in either of their lives for almost 2 years for various reasons. So I went ahead and made a long but gentle text to B about maybe considering talking to a professional about problems A mentioned - without telling A that I texted B. A texted me clearly upset and I hadn’t grasped the gravity or the sensitivity of the topic. It was something between the two of them and I had breached their trust. I was way out of line. I had been absent for 2 years and thought I could butt in and fix things like a glowing ethereal fairy whose words of wisdom would magically make all things well. I thought I had a connection with them that had clearly been far weaker than I perceived but thought I was doing a good thing. Writing that text felt like I was genuinely helping like it would change things: more so than I normally would and looking back at the text I sent to B makes my insides curdle. Like Reggae says “it wasn’t me”.You might think “ok it’s just one text to your friends what’s the big deal?” For me a lot was at stake. I hadn’t been there for a long while and was still testing the waters. I had no friends when I came back and I desperately needed friends. It felt like I kinda had to make good impressions else I’d lose them forever. I know this is super mild compared to the severity of others’ mania but for me it’s new and scary. When I realized what I had done with some semblance of sanity I just sobbed and screamed in the car for this to “go away leave me alone make it stop.”So please if you’ve made it this far a bit of advice about grounding yourself during mania would be greatly appreciated.

For the past few nights I've had dreams that I'm in relationships or in love with someone and then I wake up and am honestly kind of sad that it's not real. The content of the dreams and the lack of restful sleep is really starting to drag me into a bad depressive episode. I feel so helpless..I take 75 mg of Lamictal and 75 mg of Wellbutrin. I know vivid dreams can be a side effect of lamictal but I'm very sensitive to medication and terrified to try different drugs. I was prescribed vistaril but I hate taking it because of how tired it makes me the next day and it honestly didn't really stop the dreams. I used to smoke weed and it definitely made it so I have no dreams but I started to get horrible panic attacks so that's a no go. Does anyone have any experiences like this and could offer me advice or medications to look into?,Bipolar
46713,"Help Coping With Hypersexuality??? I’ve been feeling super hypersexual for the last month and a half after about a year of having absolutely zero interest in sex whatsoever. And I don’t know how to deal. Help!!! As background I have a lot of sexual trauma going back to childhood that I’m in the process of finding a therapist to deal with (life is hard without insurance). I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 6 years and he’s amazing but he’s not feeling the same need to suddenly have sex all the time and the sex we have been having feels a bit unfulfilling and like I’m just going through the motions.I’ve also had what was a harmless crush on a coworker for a while but lately I feel like it’s getting into risky territory where I’m changing my wardrobe and behavior and it even got to the point where he (jokingly? I can’t tell right now!) asked me out even though he knows my boyfriend well. And I didn’t say yes but the best I could do was say that it’d make my boyfriend sad. And I’m afraid I’m going to do something I regret and hurt the people I care about.I just was hoping that people might have some coping strategies.

46715,"I don’t have an appointment until Thursday and I am barely hanging on... horrible mixed episode... not sure what to do in this situation It started with a massive depressive episode after over a month of doing really good. It came out of nowhere with none of the usual triggers or red flags. It got to they point where I was about to go to the ER. The only thing that stopped me is that I work at the hospital and I would have been seen by people I know. I made it through the night. Since then I have had a few days of being almost constantly awake in various states of mania and hopelessness. My therapist can’t see me until Thursday and my Psych doc can’t see me until next Tuesday. My antipsychotic was gone I had been doing so good that I hadn’t used it in forever. All I have had is my usual meds which aren’t doing anything and my lorazepam for my panic attacks. Yesterday I had a huge panic attack in the middle of all this ended up taking more loraz than ever before and it barely touched it. My girlfriend found me walking along in the snow crying by the side of the road. An absolute mess.

46717,"I quit smoking weed and my life has gotten way better I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about a year and a half ago but I havn’t had the opportunity to go on meds yet because I’ve been moving around a lot lost my insurance bullshit like that. I started smoking weed for the first time during a manic episode about 6 months ago and smoked nightly no matter what my mood state was. If I was manic I would smoke all day everyday to feel less “up” and if I was depressed or baseline I smoked to wind down at night or to distract myself from being depressed. I swore by weed and told all my friends it was actually making me more stable but I see now that I was just numbing my symptoms. I was in a manic episode for the last month of these 6 months this recent February. Every night during this month the smoking started giving me 3 hour panic attacks. It started slowly maybe the first week I would just get paranoid about stuff like cops and then I started hearing voices ontop of the paranoia and then I slowly became convinced that I secretly had some medical issues that could kill me every second and then finally the last week or two I would smoke and just become completely convinced I would die in my sleep. This even happened at a party I didn’t even smoke that much but began hearing voices and had to leave the party early. It was humiliating. And being convinced you’re going to die is very traumatizing especially when it happens night after night. I would be laying in my bed shaking too high to even cry and praying to god to forgive me for my sins since I was going to die that night all while listening to classical music to try and calm down and hearing voices speak over the music. Finally I just said why the fuck am I paying for weed paying to have these panic attacks? So I threw it all away. This was about a week ago and I’ve been a week sober for the first time in 6 months. I can already notice myself returning back to normal. I hadn’t realized how much weed was affecting my brain even when I wasn’t high. I have wayyy less anxiety whereas when I was smoking I was wondering why I was suddenly developing anxiety. I wake up feeling refreshed and not still high from the night before. I don’t think every little ache and pain in my body is secretly cancer or something that’s going to make me magically drop dead. I’m not paranoid about cops busting in and arresting me for no reason. I was derealized for a long time and nothing felt real and now everything feels real again. I hadn’t realized how fucked up weed was making me. I guess I wanted to post this because I’ve seen people on here say the same things I used to swear by that weed is ok to self medicate with and that it actually reduces your symptoms. If you start getting paranoid when you smoke you need to stop before it becomes psychotic panic attacks like i was having. I finally feel like I’m returning back to my normal self. I’m not even sad about having to quit like I imagine doing I’d be. I have literally no desire to smoke anymore I’d do anything if it means I didn’t have to suffer another 3 hour panic attack of hearing voices and saying farewell to the world as I fall asleep and prepare to die. So yah use weed if you want. But be aware that it gets bad very quickly and likely is affecting you when you’re not high and you don’t even realize it. Take a week off and see what happens. ",Bipolar

46720,"Brain Zaps? (Not on meds) I've been off medication since October and generally doing really well really proud of myself. HOWEVER: I've been experiencing infrequent brain zaps (that's all I know how to call them but they're weird) at night. This happens only when I'm laying down at night and almost exclusively when I'm in a really bad depressive episode. I get this low humming in my ears (like when you yawn or stretch) and then it builds up really loud for a few seconds. Usually when this happens I either have really intense hallucinogenic dreams (where sometimes I can't tell if I'm awake or asleep) or I sleepwalk where I fully remember being conscious but didn't feel as though I had any control or explanation for my actions. Once I ""woke up"" scrubbing change on my bathroom floor and didn't know how long I'd been ""out"" for.I can tell when this is going to happen because I get nauseous and it doesn't matter if I'm sleeping on either side or on my back or stomach. It lasts what seems like a few seconds and then I'm ""good"" for the night (i.e. after the incident I sleep through the night).This isn't accompanied by drug or alcohol use it just seems to happen. Again almost exclusively when I'm in a bad depressive episode and only at night when I'm laying in bed.

46725,Is this normal psych hospital procedure? A few years ago on my 16th birthday I was sent to a psych hospital and stayed there for a week. Some things happened there that scared me and I'm not sure if it was standerd psych hospital procedure and I'm overeacting or if their procedures are abnormal. I was voluntarily admitted due to bipolar disorder. I wasn't on the medicine I needed and since it was an emergency I went to the psych hospital. During my time there they had a skin check. At first I didn't know they were doing they just told me to undress myself and be naked. They didn't ask if being naked in front of other people made me uncomfortable they didn't ask if I was menstruating they didn't ask if I had been sexually assaulted. I was confused and thought they were going to sexually assault me so I started crying. They then told me either I undress myself or they would restrain me. By then I was crying uncontrollably. I begged them to not make me undress myself. I let them touch under my clothes because I didn't want them to see my breasts. They forced me to take off my underwear which was uncomfortable since I was menstruating. It probably doesn't seem like much to be scared of but when the only person you've allowed to see your private parts is your pediatrician due to yearly check-up and that it is required and I have had the same pediatrician for several years so I trust her it was a big deal to me. I was stuck at the hospital for a week they said they would let me home on Friday but then said I had to stay over the weekend even though the insurance didn't cover weekends so the hospital bill put my family in some debt. My family can afford a house food utilities and all that but we aren't middle class we get free lunch at school and help from the government. Hospital bills are notoriously high in the united states and the medicine I'm on costs more in the united states than it does in third world countries and the developing world. My parents asked that I be released from the hospital but their request was denied even though I was voluntarily committed. Also the psych hospital had zero privacy. No locks on doors the shower curtain was clear. Everyone had a roommate mine treated me terribly and so I was worried she'd come in when I was in the bathroom or showering and see me. The psych hospital was tiny it was a hallway with rooms on each side some bedrooms a room to eat and a desk where a lady gave you meds. They made you go to groups but the medicine they put me on made me super tired and knocked me out. Best sleep I've had but it made the nurses and doctors angry that I wasn't participating in groups and instead sleeping. Or trying to sleep rather since the psych hospital was so small and crowded that every little noise echoed. I often hear people say psych wards make them feel safe and calm but my experience was far from it. Is it normal for psych hospitals to be like this?,Bipolar

I've been experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath headaches bouts of weakness and an inability to control my body temperature recently and it was so intense this morning I felt it warranted getting check out. This was the sickest I had ever felt in my life. After getting to a room the Dr came in quickly looked at my info and asked about the lamictal and when I last had my levels checked. She said they'd do a blood test to check and left. Someone came to draw my blood and did an ekg. A while later the nurse came back to let me know I'd been discharged. I wasn't checked out by the Dr when the heart rate and bp would go crazy no one came to check my resting heart rate would jump up to ~150bpm my blood pressure would shoot up too. I had to ask about the test results as I recieved the discharge papers as no one came back to let me know. They just checked my lamictal levels and said I was good to go. I was embarrassed when I left as I was still feeling sick and people in the waiting room watched me warble out and were asking if I was ok. Is this a thing that happens? A Dr sees the bp diagnosis and medication and decides whatever's going on is simply a medication or bp issue?

Consequently I went a total 16 days without Lithium for my Bipolar 2. During this time my bf(21) and I (23) discovered some circumstantial coincidences suggesting that our newly moved in gf(21) might be cheating on us with her ex bf. It was a whole thing shit got weird and she distances herself physically and emotionally when we confronted her (she said our fears were unfounded “he’s here on a business trip he’s in a room with two other dudes”. Tried to not give in to doubt but depression whispers so so close to your ear. Anyway I continually saw texts and snapchats coming up on her phone under dudes name. There were other things too mostly that she’s been inconsiderate lying sneaky and had tried to turn bf and I against each other following an argument of theirs. So after a business week of thought we broke up with her. She had no reaction it was almost like everything went as planned. The following three days have been filled with her running out of the house to claim some more territory coming back and exclaiming about her conquests. She’s on the lease so if. We let her stay on the condition she gets a job and really keeps up with bills. As you can imagine containing myself while unmedicated has been one fuckload of a task but I’ve held my tongue. Got the meds back in me last night started to feel better this morning and a little more throughout the day. Until a friend came over and told me that she had recently messaged him trying to latch on to him. I got so angry that I was shaking I ripped apart our storage room and consolidated 30 boxes into ten. I threw a mattress in there and set up a corner all nice. When she got home from work she said how sweet it was and thanked me for creating space for her rather than leaving her to sleep on the couch in our living room.

46746,"Am I disabled? Hi /r/BipolarReddit long time no see. I've been pretty well so I haven't been coming around much.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 10 years ago. I wasn't all that compliant with my treatment until about 5 years ago when I overcame my marijuana addiction and started getting my life under control. I was rediagnosed bipolar I from bipolar II I revamped all my meds started in on weekly group therapy then graduated to weekly individual therapy. I'd been working at Starbucks the whole time but last September I started back in school and things have been great. I haven't had a major episode in over a year. Sometimes I still get very sad and a little suicidal and there's some intrusive thoughts here and there with some paranoia/psychotic delusions but I have a 4.0 GPA!The thing is though to pay for my weekly therapy and my medication I need to maintain 20 hours a week at Starbucks to be health benefits eligible. I've been juggling school with work since September and clearly I am capable of doing that. But I'm starting to plan for September and as part of my program I have to do a placement of 10 hours a week while still maintaining a full time course load and reddit I just don't know that this is a good idea. Since September I've been tired all the time and I have no doubt the psychosis-lite comes on when I am stressed from having 3 papers due in the course of a week while still having to work 20 hours a week while having to go to class while having to go to therapy while having to maintain a social life while having to get exercise while having to cook right so I don't get ill etc etc etc. It seems to me a recipe for relapse. And TBH I'm secretly convinced that I've just been in an extended hypomanic state since September.I have a couple of friends who've been telling me for years that I should just apply for disability. I am in Ontario Canada where I can apply for a bursary for students with permanent disabilities which can pay for services including therapy. Then I could ease off on my hours at Starbucks and still maintain my treatment.But honestly I don't feel ""disabled."" I'm working 20 hours a week and maintaining a 4.0 GPA on a full course load. This it seems to me is more than fully able people do. I don't think anyone would consider me disabled either despite my long track record of being in treatment.I was just hoping to hear some discussion around the word ""disabled"" its relationship to bipolar disorder what it means to be given that title by governing agencies how you feel about the word the relationship between disability and capability and whatever else you have to say about the topic!Also I just wanted to say while I'm here that this community gave me so much support when I really needed it and I am glad it's still an awesome community full of amazing people.",Bipolar

However it is not doing so as much anymore. I'm having the issue of not sleeping going on 9 days now even though I take seraquil for sleeping. I'm also far less able to control my mood at all and I'm dealing with panic attacks as well.

Also in addition to being a college student I am in engineering....a field not really welcome to mental health issues.

46750,"Advice Bear with Me PLS Hi everyone. I have never posted on Reddit this is my first time and I wish it were something good but I need help and am too afraid to turn to anyone right now. This is TMI but its the internet right? &amp;#x200B;I have been struggling to figure out whether or not I have BP but my complicated past makes me afraid that I may have BPD so I am just going to lay it out and if anyone out there help me out. &amp;#x200B;To start. There is a stigma surrounding BPD and a part of me admits to being afraid of lying to myself so I don't get labeled as a crazy BPD. My mother was BPD and my father was a psychologist who diagnosed me as BPD by the time I was twelve but he also intensely hated my mother. I have always been incredibly emotionally sensitive but cognitively I was one of those kids who were three levels above everyone in class and three levels behind on the social scale. I dread seeing a therapist after being raised by my father who became obsessive and emotionally abusive over my being BDP. But bear with me pls.&amp;#x200B;I think I've had three episodes. My earliest one was when I was thirteen. I remember being overcome with such intense suffering that I collapsed in the shower. It was like I was catatonic. I literally couldn't get up. That night it was as if the world were silent. I remember laying in bed staring at my hands. They kept moving but I wasn't understanding that I was inside of them. I remember having the intense realization that I was going to watch these hands age and that I was inside of a living corpse. I was repulsed by that thought and became fascinated with hands for awhile. &amp;#x200B;My second episode happened my first year of college. I'll skip the fluff. One day I just stood up mid class and left. Just dropped out of college. I remember sitting there thinking what am I doing here? My professor was talking but I wasn't understanding her words. (I went back to college after a period).&amp;#x200B;But what prompted this post was the most recent episode that scared me. I convinced myself that I was losing my mind. I got obsessive over ""sanely questioning my sanity"" and ""being made to make my suffering."" Like my brain just stalled. I was in the middle of a 20 page research paper and I couldn't get my thoughts together to write it. I reread the things I wrote later and realized that I kept repeating the same words over and over. But I was also under an insane amount of stress. I was also convinced that my teachers were correcting my borderline behavior through subliminal therapy (still kind of convinced...?) This ""episode"" lasted for 4 months but I had decided to quit smoking weed right around the same time. Still I had been off of weed for awhile when I think I had an audial hallucination. I was on the verge of falling asleep in that between stage where you're still conscious but your dreams start to engulf you when this voice in the back of me head detached itself. It took on a presence of its own (idk how to explain) like it floated out of my brain and was talking. It startled me awake. I snapped out of it but I was really scared for awhile. &amp;#x200B;I won't lie a part of my has come to terms with being BPD. I have self mutilated and I have felt suicidal. I get feeling so intense that I don't know how to relieve my emotions so I will drink and push my limits in risky ways. I have issues maintaining relationships (although that has been improving now that I am consciously working on it). I know dual diagnosis is possible but a part of me seriously worries if I lie to myself so I don't have to face being BPD living up to the label put on me by an abusive parent. At the same time I am beginning to string together a family history that may suggest psychosis although no one in my family is open to talking about it. &amp;#x200B;If you made it to the end it on me- BPD BP BPBPDP. I feel close to myself right now and am looking for answers in my own way.

46751,New diagnosis nervous about medication Was diagnosed with BP 1 but it must be the mildest ever based on reading posts on here. I have been taking lexapro for three years b/c previous therapists diagnosed anxiety disorder. So currently i have a lot of mania but very little depression. and the mania doesn't seem too extreme - my therapist thought it was BP 2 but the psych testing came back BP 1 which she agrees with now. I have thought I was the second coming on occasions that's probably the most manic idea i've had. I have a good career have always done well in the workplace. I am a mom and wife and my family loves me. So I really hesitate to medicate. But I also wonder if I should keep taking Lexapro? My therapist said withdrawl from that is ugly so she doesn't recommend it. But maybe it's been triggering my mania? I was also diagnosed with mixed personality disorder mainly borderline with a heavy dose of narcissism. So naturally I am very concerned with medication that could affect my skin (already went through struggles with acne while younger not going to do that again) and also obsess about my weight.

46756,"Delusion or just incredibly elevated anxiety? Hi everybody. Last year I was diagnosed as type 2 because I haven’t experienced what I considered to be full blown mania—only hypo and I’m extremely prone to severe depressed “lows.” However I’ve been wondering a lot lately whether or not I’m just experiencing an intense level of anxiety/insecurity or if this crosses into the area of what would be considered a delusion. I haven’t had any of the more obvious signs of delusions that I’ve read about on here (i.e. thinking I’m God or somebody else or an informant etc.) but I most definitely feel all the time like I can tell 95-100% exactly what people are thinking about me to the point that it hinders me from functioning in many instances. For example I will literally coup myself up in my room for days/weeks because I feel like I absolutely know exactly what my roommates or friends/family/professors are thinking of me in these high and low emotional states and I don’t want to even confront them for this reason. I’ve even accused my mom of basically “thinking her thoughts” too loud at me or even lashing out when I think she’s judging me or thinking something extremely negative. She’ll obviously say things like I’m assuming way too much and I have no clue what I’m talking about and I still don’t believe her. I know logically when I think about this that it’s ridiculous but part of me also lets it affect me to the point that I will hide myself or freak out about it. The fact that I’m partially able to understand that this obviously isn’t the true case is what dissuades me from calling it a delusion but it’s also so strong of a fear and “observation” that it makes me wonder. What do you think? Has anybody else experienced anything this? ",Bipolar

The whole reason i’m booking an appt with a qualified professional tmrw is so I am able to get Dxd. This is more of a vent post/ Can anyone tell me about their experiences with mania and the journey to a DX I guess. Anyways loooong post under this paragraph. I’m on mobile so i apologize for any mistakes.I suspect i have bipolar. My friends suspect i have bipolar. When I first went to a therapist for devoloping issues after I made a very stressful move at 18 and was really struggling she was the first to suspect Bipolar and pushed me to to see a psych. She suspected bipolar due to very impulsive behaviors (sexual and dangerous) and hallucinations that happened while I smoked. Unfortunately I didn’t see a psych for a long time.Who really knows but i would like for this at least to be considered bc i had a hell of a time last summer and i’m probably gearing up for another hell summer if i don’t get something straight. I in no way am qualified to diagnose myself of course and this is mostly so I can get my facts straight to tell the doctor.Last summer starting around march my mood really picked up and i was having delusions paranoia psychosis all that good stuff. Maybe it was the weed maybe it was something else. I at one point believed the owner of someone i was dogsitting for was secretly filming me from a camera in her bed and her tv. I thought every police man was out to get me. I felt watched all the time. For a straight month I only ate stale kid sized bags of smart popcorn from my trunk and this was before i got kicked out of my house. I never slept more than 2 hours. I got kicked out of my house for smoking weed constanly even though i promised I wouldn’t do it again. I drove like a manic In talking going 100 down I95N (any baltimorians here?? y’all hit essex and the highway gets all twisty the adrenaline rush was insane) At the time was in the middle of a ED relapse and just didn’t give a fuck I mean i was planning to buy a dog a car an apartment with absolutely no money. Shit me and the friend i was living with had elaborate plans to start a dog grooming business. I quit my job suddenly one night for no real reason and once spent an entire 7 hours filling out loans. In september I bought a car with a loan that hand a ridiculous interest rate and smashed it into a exit sign a week later bc my phone died and i was agitated and “got bored” I have no idea what this was but thank god im alive bc i totally smashed my car to bits. I was wearing my seatbelt and I joke i’m a walking seatbelt ad.At the time I had been on Lexapro for about two weeks after seeing a psych and expressing the issues that were going on which she said sounded like anxiety and depression. The doctors in the hospital told me it was anxiety and depression. Maybe it is. I would just like some answers. I was in the hospital for six weeks where they tried out Lexapro again and after I had adverse reactions (extreme irrabilty impulsiveness) they switched me to Prozac and Risperdol and Dx’d me with BPD and let me go. My aunt had BPD but i also have a family history of undiagnosed disorders that caused extreme psychosis my grandfather used to hear voices and suffered mood swings but he was black and this was the 60s black people didn’t go to the doctor for shit like that they either drank it away or went to church. When i got out i spent 1500 dollars i didn’t have on random shit including three tattoos and completly fucked up my credit. I was medicated with a low dose of Prozac (20 mg) and Risperdol (.1mg) at the time. Three weeks later i was so depressed i did nothing but sleep and not eat. I lost ten pounds. They admitted me to the hospital for my ED about a month after I got out of my first hospitalization for the car crash. The psych there said a BPD dx didn’t make sense coming from someone who had only known me for abt four weeks and pulled it off my record. She put me on prozac and seroquel but didn’t give me a bipolar dx just left it as historical. I was doing okay and moved in with my Aunt in Texas and had about two weeks where i went off the seroquel bc i couldn’t get it refilled. I stopped sleeping again and was just generally euphoric. Nothing too crazy I was just very happy and excited and never sleeping and playing sims like a maniac. I stopped taking my seroquel after I got it refilled bc I didn’t like the feeling of forced sleep. Stopped taking my prozac too cause i just don’t give a fuck lol. Now i’ve been off my meds for about a month and a half and I’ve been okay very impulsive and hyper sexual making questionable decisions (quitting a new job I had for about a week becoming a Cam girl hopping on tinder) but still sleeping. I wanna go back on my meds but I know that after being off seroquel this long I have to wean up to the dose I was on (300mgs) cause there’s no way I can just start at that high again. Anyways anyone else just experience wild ass shit before they got a DX?? Even if i’m not bipolar I really don’t want a repeat of last summer lol.TLDR: I’m trying to go back on my meds and get a DX from a doctor.

46791,Possible Misdiagnosis? PMDD instead of Bipolar? I need possible opinions Between the ages of 12-13 I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder after a short stay in a mental hospital. This mental hospital stay was right after the start of my first period. Over the years that I was medicated I took Lamictal Prozac Buproprian and Lithium. They didn't do much except harm my memory and turn my into a zombie. However I never had many of the Bipolar symptoms to begin with. Just mood swings and a lot of PTSD related trauma behaviors. At the age of 18 I took myself off of them and almost three years later I have still not had a manic episode. However in the past few months I have noticed a pattern where my depression negative thoughts and unstoppable crying (among other things) come about a week before my period and disappear almost as soon as my period arrives. I am not sure if this is important but my mom who was given a Bipolar diagnosis that was later retracted also experienced similar pre-period symptoms. I would like to be treated for my possible PMDD however my psychiatrist is worried that potentially treating my PMDD with Prozac could reactivate any latent Bipolar Disorder. I was just wondering how often Bipolar and PMDD are misdiagnosed as one or the other and if you guys ever were misdiagnosed? How did treatment go for you? What do you use to treat your PMDD? What is your opinion on this matter as well? I don't have a lot of friends who understand this kind of thing and I want an outside opinion before I start something potentially damaging.,Bipolar

I faked it because I wanted to be helped and I thought faking some symptoms next to my real ones would allow me to be relieved of my symptoms sooner. I was in pain. I was having trouble; stress depression anxiety and terrible racing thoughts. I tried to find help but felt I wasn't being taken seriously by my psychologist and psychiatrist at the time; they diagnosed me with very mild autism a lifelong condition you're born with; I was having trouble for 8 months. I googled my symptoms for days until I was convinced I had bipolar disorder. I told my psychiatrist I was seeing things and that I was paranoid. I said that so they too would be convinced and help me get rid of those terrible racing thoughts. I ended up becoming more convinced that all of this was real. The depression got worse and worse after a few more months I didn't want to live anymore. The racing thoughts stopped after a month of rest. The antipsychotics they put me on afterwards made me sleep all day which was nice at first but I lost all motivation a little while later. The antipsychotics also made me fat which I didn't like. I was also put on lithium which made me thirsty and made my hands tremble. At a certain point in time I was no longer depressed. Shortly afterwards I went on a long holiday to my parents in Africa where I stopped taking my antipsychotics. I still take lithium but I'm planning to stop taking that as well. I would just like to say that I do not recommend anyone to stop taking their meds; I took a lot of risks doing that and I just ended up lucky because it turns out that I do not have bipolar disorder.

Back in the states I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and put on meds. When I moved back I thought I was ok and didn't need help. That turned out not to be the case and in August of last year I went to a GP and asked for anti-depressants. He said he wouldn't prescribe them to me and said it would be best if I see a mental health specialist and he did the referral. That took until January and in the meantime my depression got worse I got fired from my job due to the symptoms and started putting weight back on. I would see my GP each month and beg for just a week or two of anti-depressants he didn't budge. The referral came through in January and I got an appointment in the middle of February. It was just an intake appointment the Doctor there said he didn't want to prescribe anything until I had blood work done that was another 14 days. That's finally done and I now have an appointment booked in the middle of April where hopefully I'll get a prescription. I'm a big proponent of universal health care in the US but honestly I don't understand how people in the UK with mental health issues survive.

I'm bipolar and have had a lot of success with lamotrigine but it took me a really long time to start taking it because there's such an intense stigma around medicating mental illnesses. I kind of assumed I would lose all sense of self if I took them and I wish I didn't have that feeling for so long (over a decade).So I started up a project called Wear Your Meds recently to try and help other people not feel that way. Basically it's a series of 1"" buttons and each button shows a commonly-prescribed mental illness medication. Anyone who wears one of these buttons is signaling that they’re open to sharing their personal story of how the medication helped. It's also a show of solidarity because sometimes it can feel like no one else you know is on meds. I'm hoping some people on here would be into it. More info is at wearyourmeds.com",Bipolar

Hey I don't know if these type of questions are allowed on this subreddit but I figured the best way to understand someone who is living with a bipolar disorder is to ask people who live with a bipolar disorder.I met my ex-girlfriend when we were younger. We became best friends and I saved her life 2 times when she tried to commit suicide. Because of this I always thought that we have a really deep connection. However we only started dating 3 years after knowing each other. I was 18 she was 20. We dated for 2 years and our relationship was beautiful but also exhausting from time to time. Constant suicide thoughts because of the slightest issues and also a shitty behaviour that she showed from time to time including insulting manipulating and blackmailing me. She also had depressions social anxiety schizophrenia and I think borderline. So it's hard to distinguish why she behaved like she did.However after 2 years of dating her best friend and 2 other friends came back in her life. She suddenly lost ALL interest in me. That's what I personally think is because of borderline since they always need 1 favourite person in life and can't have 2 at the same time.But what really surprises me and what can't really be explained with any of the other things is that she really.. changed. A lot. And quickly. We always used to play videogames watch movies go for a walk in the park or woods. And then when her best friend came back in to her life she changed completely. She was suddenly going partying drinking alcohol every day she also seemed to have lost every other mental illness she had. No signs of depression anymore no signs of social anxiety anymore. She was suddenly like one of the girls of these clichee american student movies that only drink alcohol and party and just enjoy their live without any fear of repercussions. And then she broke up. She had no sense of any guilt anymore. Cancelled a date with me to go out with another guy broke up over whatsapp 30 minutes later she came by with another guy to pick up her stuff. When I talked to her mother her mother cried and told me that her daughter just said ""I have to go own my way now."" the whole time and that they (her parents) also worry about her and don't know what is happening. Apparently she also wasn't home at that point for 1 week anymore. She is also not using any social media platform anymore or is playing any video games anymore which was basically her whole life before that.I first thought this was because of borderline too so I asked people with borderline about it and they said that even they would never do anything like that. So my last hope before I have to accept that she just wasn't a good human is to ask you guys. Could all of this be explained because of her bipolar disorder ? Like a manic episode ?",Bipolar

When I was a teen I used to habitually hallucinate at night seeing shadows as things they weren't picture things lurking in corners hear things etc. It kept me up for hours with lights on hoping the images wouldn't become more vivid or real feeling. Most times they didn't. Sometimes they did.Ever since I started getting medicated though my night vision has devolved into shit. I physically cannot see in the dark no matter what not without a source of definitive light. While medication severely lessened hallucinations it didn't rid me of them. I still fairly often hear things that aren't there. But night hallucinations? The inability to see has made them nigh impossible. Is it possible my brain decided to rewire itself a bit to make my life easier? I mean it's done that before when I grew to be more introverted and self-sustainable socially or re-conditioned my conscious brain to want and need more sleep. If so hecking wild.

So my psychiatrist wanted me to double my dose from 50mg to 100mg last night and I did. As soon as the meds start to kick in my heart starts beating like crazy and I get this extremely dizzy feeling like I am about to pass out any second. At times it feels like my body just starts falling as I lay in the bed. I have taken a lot of different drugs but this feeling made me panick a bit thinking I might be allergic or something. A couple of hours in and the symptons didn't change so I figured that if it was something that was truly dangerous surely my symptoms must have gotten worse by now and I went to bed. Didn't feel any side effects this morning except for some pretty bad shoulder pain but that started while I was on 50mg. Are these normal side effects and I just have to get used to them? Didn't feel anything like that at all while I was on 50mg. But I have only been in treatment for like 5 days so most of you know better than me. I also took 10mg of zopiclone (about 5mg of lunesta/eszopiclone) last night and some melatonin. I am also on a lot of tramadol and sometimes some instant release oxycontin due to some pain I got after being admitted to the hospital with acute pancreatitis. Which is actually how I found out I have bipolar. so maybe it had something to do with mixing it? I have been on zopiclone for over 6 years though and never experienced anything like that.

Like everything inside me is wrong - all my bones ache as if they don't fit inside my body like they want to burst out. Like I want to explode. It's a kind of intense restless agitation to which nothing brings relief. Sometimes I go for a run or bike ride to try calm myself down but it doesn't have a big effect and often I end up overexerting myself and get hurt. What appeals to me most in this state is the thought of hurting myself or not living or losing myself in drugs. It's very hard to keep myself from self-harming. I've been in this state for so long and I don't know how much more I can take. In the past I've described it as 'restlessness' because I don't know how else to describe it. But it's clear to me that it's much more than that.Is this a mixed episode? I've been like this for so long... Sometimes they'll last for one day sometimes days sometimes weeks or maybe even months. I'll then have a brief period of respite before returning to the state I've described above. While in this state I can often get into a kind of semi-mania and get things done which I never thought I could - read books make art play music write essays - but always with this horrible exploding depressive restlessness underneath. And it's extremely hard to motivate myself to do anything. But if I curl up in bed or try to calm down with a film or music my heart begins to pound and shake my entire body and the restlessness just gets worse and worse and I want to die.I've tried lots of times to search on the internet for this kind of feeling but I've never found anything. However reading this sub today I'm struck by how people seem to have had similar sensations. I really didn't think I was Bipolar because I don't think I have contrasting periods of 'highs' and 'lows'. I might be in a relative 'low' but there will always be the potential for a relative 'high' to emerge quickly out of this low. And vice versa. It's as if everything is there at once as if I'm in a low and a high at the same time. Always fluctuating but always wrong. It's awful. It has really impacted all aspects of my life. I've withdrawn from society and do not keep contact with anyone and when I do meet people they are scared or unnerved by how bizarre my behaviour is.I know it's unwise to seek opinions on the internet but at this point in time I have no friends who I can talk to about this and I don't have the money to see a doctor or psychologist.If a redditor or two could give their thoughts on my state it might help point me in the right direction.Thank you.",Bipolar

I think I’ve also been in denial in the past that I ever did anything outside of my control during an episode and downplayed it but this was the kick in the pants that reminded me what it’s really like. Anyway in the aftermath there are some things that are still really getting me down (pretty sure I’m still depressed). This is the first episode I’ve had since my son was born. Before he was born I expressed to my wife that I was worried about passing bipolar on to him and I was even more worried about having an episode while I was home alone with him. Well I did end up having to be home alone with him a couple of times and it really terrifies me. At one point I was trying trying to get him into his car seat and he was giving me a really hard time. He wasn’t being intentionally difficult really he was just playing trying to turn off the dome light. I ended up screaming at him in my driveway while I tried to get him into the seat so I could buckle him in. He started bawling. That was early on in the episode and at that point I hadn’t realized yet that I was off in any way but a couple minutes later I realized I had just done something that I would never ever ever normally do. The other times I was with him I just felt so down that I could barely respond to his needs for food or a diaper change or whatever and definitely couldn’t play with him. It was really hard to look at him in the face. He had no idea what was going on and couldn’t understand why I couldn’t read to him or play with cars when that’s what we normally do every day. The one time I tried to read to him I started weeping before I got past the first page. Like I said I was worried that something like this would happen but I was not at all prepared to handle it nor was I at all prepared for how it would make me feel. After screaming at him I’m worried I’m going to become violent. And when I have trouble feeding him it’s just an overwhelming feeling that I can’t take care of the kid that depends on me just to survive. I feel completely unable to parent properly and like I am a complete failure as a dad. It has me wondering if my family would be better off without me (not necessarily in a suicidal kind of way more like should I just leave?). In my mind I keep telling myself I’m being irrational but it’s pretty hard to believe right now. My wife knows I’m feeling down still and last night she asked me if I was going to be ok with him in the morning (I get him ready for the day and take him to childcare for the day because she leaves early). I know it’s a necessary question but the fact that it even needs to be asked really cuts deep. Anyway idk what I’m really looking for with this post. Just needed to get it out. ",Bipolar
46848,I hurt someone today It's said that those you push away the hardest and still somehow fight to remain should be cherished and I do cherish you. Even though sometimes my actions speak otherwise deep within it's undoubtebly clear that some people can weather the storm and when I can actually speak out it's just to confirm my misguided reality that consumes me whole that no I am not alone and that to be alone is sometimes even my greatest desire and that I suffer to espouse that truth and revert to a sequence of events that could very well led to a reality and truth different from my desires to become intertwined— and it's scares me. And yet through those moments I leave behind everything and continue on my merry way as if actions don't continue to have consequences that are severe and just stubbornly maintain my path without a single thought of those outside my bubble and thus greatly alienate those that only care and support. It's just not fair. It's my greatest burden and yet I unfurl as if it's just and nebulously accept that I can't escape; but somehow I pester on incesstantly able to change my direction and yet I can't and sometime the act of several conjoined inactions are my closest held resolve and action. I feel like a taker that returns little and some will have me believe it isn't my fault but how can it not be how convient that I can absolve myself thoroughly and just continue wistfully.,Bipolar

Obviously i didn’t kill myself i didn’t even attempt. I’ve been at points in my life where I’ve just given up but this doesn’t feel like that. This feels like I’ve been desperately grasping at anything that can give me a reason to live just one more day over and over. I’ve found that the small things are the most effective because it’s hard to see myself with any “big” future. I can’t tell if this is good or bad. I know it’s good that I’ve been trying to escape these suicidal thoughts and use every coping mechanism I know but the fact that nothing seems to work for more than an hour or two seems disheartening.

Am I likely to experience full-blown mania without medication?Some background:After a period of minor depression I reverted to old habits and smoked some marijuana which caused my first manic episode. I spent some time in a psych ward and was given lithium and zyprexa which didn't fully suppress my manic state. After a couple months in hypomania I gave my zyprexa to someone else I'd med who couldn't afford them. I thought I'd be fine with just a week until my next refill. I was wrong and went manic totalled my car and ended up back in the psych ward. Now I'm dealing with the fallout from this event.I'm 26 and generally high functioning. I was an alcoholic for a few years and have been sober for about 4 years (it runs in my family). I'd smoked pot before but not often because it would make me feel very anxious and make my thoughts race.Is this extreme episode of mania my new normal or is it likely a one-off ? I'd never experienced them before. In fact I don't think I'd ever really experienced general hypomania before only excitement related to specific projects or areas of interest.I'm unable to find much online about this here's one:&gt;Clinicians agree that cannabis use can cause acute adverse mental effects that mimic psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&gt;[...]&gt;Cannabis abuse prior to development of bipolar disorder has a significant effect on first-episode mania and on the course of the disease.

In 2016 I started seeing a male PCP in the south who told me he would handle my diagnosis unless he felt I needed to see a specialist. He changed me from Celexa to a high dose of Prozac increased my Seroquel put me on upto 9 Xanax a day as well as Klonpin. Diagnosed me with ADHD and started adderall. He changed my meds a few times saying I did not need to wean off or on as they were in the same family....I ended up in ER twice. Had several Manic breakdowns/hysterical fits (i didn't consider bipolar at the time) lost time....then over christmas he left and the other dr refused to process my xanax refill and I went through 2 weeks of withdrawal. When he returned he apologized and said ""I'm surprised you're here most people don't make it through that alive without hospitalization....I stopped going outside of needed refills. In 2018 I had no insurance and my partner and I decided I would probably be okay going off meds for a bit and use cannabis (legal here) as the previous Dr had suggested. &amp;#x200B;That is when things got bad. My symptoms blew up and I started changing (I also turned 25). I've never been an ""angry"" person not even when I should be. All of a sudeen I couldn't make it through work. I couldnt think. My moods were changing and I would have a week or two and then literally not be able to do ANYTHING for weeks. The house started getting messier I wasn't cooking or eating canceling shifts left and right couldn't think or read through anything....My partner started expressing conern over my need to ""at least get back on seroquel and adderall"". In august our dog died traumatically. PTSD symptoms fllared. My partner has BPD anxiety and depression that is not medicated. His anxiety sending me into full panic attacks and anger. &amp;#x200B;I got insurance this year and January I requested an appointment with a PCP.

PCP has me come in to address medicine and for ""safety checks"" mentioning inpatient options. I can't do that. It is not an option. I have laid out my sypmtoms and cited that my sister and father have Bipolar disorder. My chart says ""Bipolar 2 suspected but not formally diagnosed depression anxiety adhd nos.)&amp;#x200B;Today I went in telling her it seems my depression has improved marginally but my anxiety has been horrible and constant. shaking constanty not sleeping headaches and picking my skin on my face and arms worse than I have in a year (i skin pick with anxiety).

She puts me back on Seroquel and then tells me she would like to take me off the adderall and wished she had not started it as she attended a conference for ""patient's in crisis"" and they expressed the need to treat Bipolar or other disorders before ADHD and adderall.

I tell her I think it is a bad idea as it is the only improvement I have had to mood ability to get out of bed and work- and it seems to sometimes help the anxiety probably because I can think somewhat clearly. She then tells me to come in next week and that the psych doc may completely change my meds in two weeks and he or she may still take me off of Adderall. Hopes the seroquel will aid in sleep picking and anxiety as well as upping the limotrigine. Perscribes me nothing for the panic constant anxiety not even refilling the 5 mg of Lorazepam she previously would give me 5-10 at a time. To be fair I told her it wasn't doing much of anything and I did not ask for a refill today- thinking she would perscribe SOMETHING to help me.&amp;#x200B;I am completely overwhelmed. I have been screaming for help for months and all I have been able to get from it has been constant med changes (which I know is a thing but....) wants to take me off the only thing that is helping and just basically having them hope I'll make it through until the med appointment and checking weekly to see if I have killed myself or been admitted yet. The idea of going off the adderall literally crushed me. The mention of starting completely over was too much. I was literally crying and shaking the entire time I was in the appointment. I didn't ask for this. I am barely holding on. My social life is gone I can't make any commitment by the time it comes up either from anxiety depression or complete exhaustion. I didn't ask for this. I can't enjoy things. I can't breathe or stop shaking. My mouth is twiching from constantly holding it in a weird position to prevent my chin from shaking. I'm falling apart and everyone see's it but there is nothing they can do? How am I supposed to do this? Killing myself wouldn't even matter. It would make everything worse for the people already suffering from me I'd just be another number on a statistic sheet and other people would still go through this. I have lost 13 friends 10 to suicide. One was a fucking psychologist.&amp;#x200B;TLDR; this process of waiting and changing meds while waiting for 3 months for psych is too much.

This year has been fine. But I've just litterally been in my bed listening to talk radio on my phone smoking my vape pen hardly getting out . I'm not depressed. I went through a depression last year and got through that with the right medication and now I feel just a static of nothingness. I just don't do anything at all. I have no motivation to leave my room. It's weird. Not even shop or goto the beach listen to music. Has this happend to anyone ? How long does this funk last for? How can I get out of it?

46888,"I need energy! So back in September I finally came out of a multi-year depression and since then I’ve been getting CBT which has helped so much. But I’m still dealing with daily fatigue. I have a fairly light school/work schedule right now and it still tires me out. I feel like I’m really being held back by it and worried I won’t be able to go away to grad school. I’m exhausted from the moment I get up in the morning and I’m finding it really hard to sit down and write. It’s mental as well as physical fatigue hard to focus my brain on anything. I miss feeling “sharp”.I’m dx’d BP2 + BPD + OCD tendencies but I haven’t experienced true hypomania in a very long time—I’m more prone to mixed episodes/irritability. I *do* experience occasional psychotic episodes (paranoia delusions that make my brain feel like it's been electrocuted and often leaves me ""hungover"") but these (in addition to most of my self harm urges) seem to be a result of the BPD as opposed to the Bipolar. I’ve been on lamotrigine (225 mg) since 2012/2013 + went on bupropion (Wellbutrin) almost 2 years ago (200 mg). The bupro I went on to try to bring myself out of depression; it worked a bit and I tolerate it but nothing miraculous.Now that I’m not in a depression though and I’m *still* so tired I’m wondering what else to do. My doctor ran a bunch of bloodwork and my iron was kinda low but taking iron supplements hasn’t fixed anything. I even tried taking Cytomel despite (hypo end of) normal thyroid testing but it made me very ragey and I had to stop. My Dr’s temp suggested that maybe it’s the lamotrigine causing fatigue which is interesting and I might try bringing it down a titch but a couple years ago I lowered it a bit (under supervision) and my self-harm urges went up. But I also want to try lowering it a bit for brain fog reasons (i.e. it gives me brain fog).So! While that’s something I can try I’m also wondering about energizing adjuncts. Wellbutrin is not giving me energy (or if it is I’d hate to see how I am without it)—(nor is it raising my libido or suppressing my cravings; it just seems to have given me tinnitus but I’m still worried about going off it because this is still the most stable/non-depressed I’ve been in years). Tbh at the end of last semester I turned to energy drinks in desperation and—they don’t make me manic? Sometimes I barely feel them. Still those are obviously not great to be using. So I’ve been looking into modafinil/armodafinil and Vyvanse … I imagine I would stay on lamotrigine because I overall tolerate it and it seems to be doing *something* … Sorry this is rambly and yes I’ve used search for past threads but—**tl;dr – Any thoughts on adding modafinil/armodafinil** Normal.csv disorders sorting.sh **Vyvanse to lamotrigine?

46899,"Cognitive-Behavioral Function/Dysfunction vs. Mood Disorder I have never felt that my bipolar is a “mood disorder”. My upbringing and career have made me into someone who is not very in touch with my emotions and moods... I have always been turned off by my pdoc’s suggestion to keep a “mood journal”.I’ve always seen my moods or moments of happiness/sadness etc as situational. It is difficult for me to look back at periods of my life and discern any mood swings in the context of bipolar.Recently my therapist (a new therapist for me) posed a question: “Are you feeling X or Y? ... those are common in mood disorders...”My response was to reject the term “mood disorder” as a descriptor for my bipolar. I said that my experience of bipolar is one of different phases of cognitive-behavioral function or dysfunction. Depression isn’t depressed mood but a decrease in the quality of my functioning (but I can still function if I push myself). Baseline is functioning. The hypomania spectrum is higher functioning (I’ve developed a way to focus hypomania on school/work so I don’t spin out). Mania is complete inability to function [within the confines of societal norms].And while mania includes a euphoria feedback loop I see it more than a sub-symptom of delusions- a “mood” that is solely born out of the far-between brief psychotic states rather than an everyday experience of the majority of my life with bipolar.And I understand depression and hypomania encompass behaviors and functional levels that are not necessarily strictly associated with moods/emotions but when it comes to actual moods and emotions I feel like that is something outside of my bipolar experience. I can stay in bed until noon but still have a great day (or whether I have a good/bad day is dependent on whatever people/stimuli I come across). I can be hypomanic over a work project but then go home at night and get sad due to loneliness. All kinds of combinations of emotionally-neutral activity with situationally-based emotion on any given day.Anybody else experience bipolar this way? Accepting the bipolar diagnosis but don’t see it as a mood disorder or don’t identify your experience as a “mood disorder”?",Bipolar

It's hard.I don't know how to explain this... But my reality and perception is constantly compromised by my mental state. Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming... And when I snap out of it or come back from it... It feels like it never happened but still leaving those I love confused and hurt.I get scared of myself and sometimes don't recognize myself and just seeing a glimpse of myself in the mirror is scary. I feel like a whole other person.My anxiety that the ups and downs brings leads me to want to make impulsive decisions such as cutting out those I love including my boyfriend. Feeling cozy and settled with him or anyone scares me and even happy moments send me fear that makes me want to run. But I don't really want to leave.

Honestly I have a problem with doing so because I've been a bit self-destructive and purposely go off of medication to ""feel"" something or to induce mania.Well after having a particularly bad depressive episode after a particularly bad manic episode that started to become psychotic (seeing shadow people forming complex delusions thinking my assailant is after me again) I'm struggling to figure out how I'm going to talk to him about dumping my seroquel down the toilet.Truth be told like I've read many others say seroquel makes me feel dead. It helps regulate sleep but I hardly function in the day and it does a damn good job of making me in a continual depressive state. I told him when he tried to re-prescribe it to me the first time I met him after being out of the psychiatric hospital ... and he didn't listen to me or take me seriously when I told him it makes me suicidal. :cSo now that I broke my promise of not taking my seroquel idk how to communicate to him that I don't trust him. He didn't even refill my lithium after we first met so I was rapid cycling all of February. I feel like an emotional train wreck and the seroquel helped me crash from my manic episode last week but this depressive episode this week was god awful.Should I just find a new psychiatrist if I don't feel like he is helping me and I don't trust him? Being on Medicaid makes my life more difficult. If it helps I have type I with psychotic features and PTSD.Thank you in advance for helping. I've found this subreddit so supportive and not knowing anyone with bipolar disorder I don't feel as completely out of my mind seeing so many similarities to other people with my diagnosis.

46918,"What careers can BP sufferers succeed in? To start let’s just say I’ve had a very hard time getting my career together. Took me seven years to get a bachelors degree in Information Systems. My grades in subjects that interest me I excelled in and anything else I usually failed or received a sympathy D.My first Job out of college I was happy for about 6 months then I started struggling. This was well before I was diagnosed and started having intense panic attacks. I was able to hold that job for another year before I was let go right in the middle of the Great Recession.So I tried to freelance however I struggled. I would program for hours upon hours until I would crash after a few days. That led to poor quality work and I was in over my head. It was the perfect example of being overly ambitious and it led to me abusing Xanax to try and reduce the anxiety. I literally forgot two weeks of my life off of one binge.Luckily I was diagnosed and got on the right medications. I’ve been sober for quite a few years but I’ve had very little luck becoming financially independent. That’s kind of the cruelest thing about it because my mood has improved however I’m still spinning my wheels. I’m getting older and feel like I’m running out of time to build any type of meaningful career.My question is what careers have bipolar sufferers been able to excel in? Is there anything that fits the personality type so to speak? Seriously need to know what careers would accept someone who is only productive 6 months out of the year and burns out quickly. I feel I need to work in a field completely different than what I’m in because it’s just not working.",Bipolar

So why it feels damaging..I have 2 outcomes: first is logical but I can't accept it the second is irrational I can't prove it but it feels like it's the truth.

46925,"My experience with tramadol This past week I was prescribed 8 tablets of tramadol for an unrelated post-treatment painkiller and I felt completely different. It’s hard to explain but basically even during arguments and other stressful situations that unsettle me I was able to stay calm and focused. I felt enough of the “anger” emotion that I knew I was angry but my brain was calm enough to accept the anger and be passive while yet acknowledging it. I was also productive and in great spirits which seems to be the norm on this opioid.I’ve never been diagnosed and I’ve always lied on depression quizzes at the hospital but the truth is a couple weeks ago it hit me that my mood swings and depression might not be normal.I realized that sometimes I am completely happy and good to the point of being TOO happy. I will often hyper-organize my house deep clean or workout every single day... basically checked off every symptom of a mania. During these times I paintwrite exercise I eat and cook hell I even tackle projects outside and have a hard time falling asleep for being too excited with my projects. I’ve also had bad instances with alcohol during these times from a feeling of cockiness and recklessness where I have acted out in ways I am ashamed of.As for the depression it comes on as low and long as it can be. I sleep on the couch during the day lose weight and am constantly weepy or angry. I do not like to work on anything much less have the energy to deep clean or create. These “mood swings” as Ive always called them come in bouts of weeks sometimes months and occasionally like I mentioned as a result of an argument or something else incredibly stupid. This is having a toll on my marriage and family and I am curious as to medications having any similar effect on me as tramadol which I read up on and completely agreed with the following: “In fact one of the reason people like taking Tramadol is because for some people it works as an antidepressant producing euphoria or energy unlike other opioids which tend to make people drowsy. This has led it being used recreationally while people still go to work or live their daily lives.” blog.iodine.comI am obviously not going to get this prescription refilled and don’t need the cautions because like I said I read up and completely understand the danger of taking opioids as anything other than a TEMPORARY strong painkiller.TL;DR I’m (24f) hesitant to take the first step in getting diagnosed or treated for what I suspect is Bipolar 1 Disorder. Had a good experience with an unrelated painkiller and would like to hear from people who self-diagnosed and are now on treatments or anyone who can relate to my experience. ",Bipolar

Maybe just a place where I can spew how I'm feeling out without being afraid of creating some kind of judgment or conflict. I have been having a growing identity crisis lately.

I mean my sleep pattens are a mess but overall I’ve been getting at least 5 hours of sleep every night! Plus it’s not like I’m euphoric all the time? I suddenly get this waves of euphoria and need to dance? At last happy? I also have a atrong desire to go vegan to feel more connected to nature and at the same time to do keto so that I can fast easily and feel more connected to myself! I’m making no sense and I know that! But I keep questioning whether I’m actually manic or happy or just faking it I’m honestly confused but happy? ",Bipolar
46948,"Anxiety and distress - drifting In January I quit my job because my wife had been begging me to. Also my pdoc. It was a horrible and abusive place with so many unexplainable micro aggressions and condescending actions to name or number. They have about a 60% turnover rate. And they like that number. It was a well paying job and I shouldn’t have quit but I was on the brink of believing them that I am worthless. I tried to overdose around January 7th but luckily couldn’t find the right meds in the house that night. My wife doesn’t know about that. Since I quit I was hoping to snap out of it. But when you fucked up head is chemical I guess environment doesn’t really do a lot. Despite your best efforts. I have slipped into depression like never before. I can’t get a new job and I realize just how immature it was to quit the one before. I’ve never quit anything. My wife is away on a conference cause she is badass and so smart. She is in DC with her people from grad school presenting this week. They are all in an Airbnb that I picked out for them. She says it’s beautiful. I know that she is true and that she lives me. Cognitively I know this but when she fails to call me and gets too busy my heart crushes and I can hear the voices that tell me I have no value to her or the family. I can’t focus on the right things. I don’t know how to snap out. Be a man. Take better care of my kids. Be there for her. Not be so selfish and get a fucking job again. Just so frustrating.

46951,"Recent experience with lamictal &amp; painkillers Hello friends.I've been on lamictal for about 8 months. It was a godsend to me. Starting from a very low dose it helped me feel more content and at-ease and I went from having panic attacks every time I left the house to being able to go about and live my life.Here's the wrinkle: I initially spiraled into crippling depression and anxiety last year after tapering off of the opiate pain medication oxycodone. I was on on oxycodone after undergoing a surgical procedure to stabilize much of my cervical spine which had become unstable as a result of a genetic condition I have. I was in a horrible place and Lamictal is what finally got me out of it.I was about 9 months post-op last year and doing really well feeling really great about my health and future when a bunch of my pre-operative symptoms suddenly returned. Scans confirmed that my surgery had failed and I had to go through a revision procedure a more complex procedure than I had before earlier this year. Currently I am a bit more than 2 months post-op from the revision surgery. I was hoping to keep my pain meds low and get off of them quickly this time around but the surgery was predictably much more painful and I also developed an infection shortly after surgery that sent my pain levels sky-high unlike anything I had experienced before. So while I wanted to limit my use of oxycodone I ended up on double the dose I took last year (60 mg total per day vs. 30 mg total per day last year).I have spent the last month carefully tapering off of oxycodone. I am now down to 25% of what I was initially taking after surgery (i.e. I'm now down to 15 mg total per day) which is 50% of what I was taking last year. Everything seemed to be going smoothly which I attributed in part to being on lamictal this time. Then about a week ago just before the step-down to my current oxycodone dose I started to feel the depression creep back in. Hoping to get ahead of it I called my p-doc and we decided to increase my dose of lamictal a bit from 125 mg to 150 mg. But instead of protecting me from decline I feel like the increased dose accelerated the onset of symptoms. I am significantly more depressed and irritable and I have started to become anxious and a bit agoraphobic again. Making matters much worse some physical symptoms have flared up this week including a very alarming sharp pain right at the base of where my surgery was performed. While these symptoms may be a normal part of the long healing process after a major surgical procedure I am terrified that something got screwed up again. I took a little extra oxycodone this morning and it has helped the pain somewhat but this is obviously not the direction I want to go in for the sake of my mental health.I guess I'm posting here because I feel frightened and a bit trapped. Last year lamictal was like a miracle for me. I felt relief at a very low dose and I continued to experience improvement as I increased the dose. I was hoping for the same result when I increased the dose last week but I am only feeling more depressed and anxious. That said there are a ton of other factors in play here including my oxycodone taper continued recovery from surgery 2 months ago a flare-up of physical symptoms fear about the state of my surgery and recovery normal psychological distress resulting from my current ordeal (feeling isolated/cooped up losing autonomy feeling uncertain about my future etc.) fear of the fear I experienced last year when things went south etc. etc.Typing this out it seems unreasonable to expect anything from a small increase in my lamictal dose one way or the other or at the very least it seems impossible to parse out what is a result of lamictal versus the many other things going on. But I guess I'll still throw my inquires out there:Has anyone experienced a marked increase in depression or anxiety upon increasing their lamictal dose and if so did things even out with time or further dosage increases?Does anyone have experience with oxycodone / other opiate painkillers that impacted your mental health or interacted with your psych meds?For what it's worth I also take Effexor XR 75 mg daily Dexedrine SR 5 mg 2x/day and Klonopin 0.5 mg at night to sleep.",Bipolar

46954,Can’t smoke weed anymore sooo I smoked really heavily for about 8 months starting in one manic episode continuing through a depressive episode through stability then in another manic episode. During that episode it made me completely psychotic (while high) where I would hear voices walk around my apartment building paranoid as fuck and be 100% convinced I was going to die. This was every night for about 6 weeks. I had to leave a party early cuz I was hearing voices and then became convinced my Uber driver was an angel. The whole sha-bang. Anyway I stopped smoking because of the embarrassment from that party incident and now I’m also in the depressive episode from that manic episode. I haven’t smoked in about 2 months but I’m depressed as fuck. I’m too young to buy alcohol. I’ve just been replacing weed with CBD and since that’s very expensive I’ve been taking 50-75mg of benedryl to chill out and eventually fall asleep. I know this is like a mild substance abuse problem but idk. I’m so depressed and fucking miserable and hopeless it’s so nice to take a bunch of benedryl and shut my brain off.

46958,"Just received my BP2 diagnosis - 12 years in the making Hey everyone. Although knowing that I suffer from Bipolar II Disorder is disheartening it is a relief to have a diagnoses and a concrete action plan to manage it. I have suffered from Major Depression since the age of 9; but it wasn't until this week at the age of 21 that I was diagnosed with BP2 after having a 2.5-week-long hypomanic episode.During my episode I displayed all textbook symptoms to varying degrees of destructiveness. Luckily I did not do anything that had huge lasting consequences. During these 2.5 weeks I was aware that I was acting abnormally but I didn't see any problems with it because I felt better than I ever had before while sleeping less than 2 hours each night and eating less than 500 calories per day. When I crashed out of it I knew that I had to speak with my psychiatrist.He immediately took me off of my 300mg Wellbutrin (I haven't noticed any withdrawal symptoms yet) and scheduled an appointment with me ASAP. At the appointment we discussed the many options for medication (anti-psychotics &amp; mood stabilizers). We settled on Depakote and I am now on 500mg for 14 days then 1000mg for the next 14. At that point we will meet again and re-evaluate the treatment plan.It seems like this is a very informative and supportive community. If you all have any advice or resources to offer someone who is starting out on their treatment journey I'd be happy to hear it. I am especially interested in people's experiences with Depakote apps that can be used to track mood and how to build up a support network of friends and family.Thanks to all &lt;3 ",Bipolar

I’ve done it before and it’s not the most fun thing but tolerable.At the same time I’m starting vyvanse for binge eating. I was already doing weight watchers and since September I’ve lost 21 lbs but I’ve got about 70 more to go - this is a result of an episode that was triggered by going through a lot of life changes in a short period of time. The weight has caused me to have severe social anxiety. My doctor has known me since before I gained the weight and knows what a struggle it’s been. She knows this weight is not normal for me but as a result of the self-medicating with food. I see her again in a week or so since medications are changing.The vyvanse is helping so much regarding I was always sleeping during the day on weekends I never had any energy plus I’m not binge eating as often.

46960,How Do I Stop Impulsive Spending? Hey everyone I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 last December and it explained so many things for me. One of them was how I love to spend on food projects and other stuff I don’t need. The only problem is that I’m on medication now and the new one I’m on seems to be helping me stay stable. While the impulsive urges to spend are pretty much gone I’m still going after food. At this point I think it’s just a deeply ingrained habit. I really need to save my money so I can purchase the gear I need for my summer job. I want to just eat at home for the rest of the month and not buy anything I don’t need but I feel like I will keep falling into my old hypomanic habits. Can someone please help me?

46961,"Rehab stories? I have a dual diagnosis of depression &amp; alcohol addiction. However I suspect I’m actually bipolar (but still an alcoholic). I have been on 200 mg Zoloft for three years and it doesn’t seem to be helping; frankly I don’t know if it ever did or if life circumstances were what made me feel like it did. I also have therapy but I only see her once every two weeks and I just started seeing her last month. Nonetheless the past few months have been absolute hell. A lot of change in my life has occurred and therefore stress has followed but some other things outside of being stressed have also added to it. I’m a special education teacher &amp; this is my first year teaching. I feel like I’m completely in over my head and like I’m not supported at work. I’m the only SPED teacher there and am constantly overlooked. I moved out of my parents during the summer when I got my job here in San Diego. I absolutely love my apartment and where I live &amp; I’ve always my own space (I grew up sharing a room with my 2 sisters my whole life). While I love it and am grateful to be where I am I’m alone every single day and don’t have friends here. I’m codependent &amp; am constantly on the lookout for a man who will temporarily fill the void that my ex has left in me. This turns into having strangers come over and sharing my bed with them for the sake of feeling desired and not alone &amp; jumping into relationships that are short-lived because I’m a mess or because they move on. I was drugged by someone I went on a date with who then took me back to my apartment and raped me in my bed. That was on November 6th. My social anxiety at work is through the roof. I feel scrutinized all the time. I’m afraid everyone thinks I’m not good at my job and I’m only there because they were desperate for someone to take that particular class (moderate/severe disabilities). I attempted suicide last month and was out of work for two weeks. They were supportive but my anxiety tells me I’m a burden. This has also caused great concern for my parents who already have to deal with my older sister (that’s a whole different story). My drinking is out of hand and I feel completely lost. When I’m not drunk I’m numb and my thoughts are too much to handle. When I am drunk I lose control and slice up my thighs with scissors. That happened just a week ago. However I’ve been managing my drinking since then but I don’t know how long that’ll last. Today I tied a scarf around my neck and tightened it until I couldn’t breathe just to see how it felt. Suicide ideation is constantly running through my mind. My sleep schedule is absolutely fucked. I’m either awake for 30 hours at a time or I have to sleep for an entire day. Basically nothing is getting better. Ideally I’d like to make it to the end of the school year and then look into rehab options for the summer. I’ve been depressed for three years and this is the worst I’ve ever had it &amp; it is affecting every aspect of my life &amp; I would rather deal with it all now than let it continue to get worse.

Mainly to get it off my chest maybe just something to leave behind. I’m trying not to be over dramatic. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 2 about 5 years ago. My post can be triggering to some. Around December I started noticing downs more often. I’ve been really stressed and it started then. I couldn’t afford rent and medication took out some loans. Now I’m even further behind. I’ve been fighting to stay positive. It’s been really hard. Like really hard. Ive honestly thought of selling my body just to get on top. Also my owners of the company I work for. just recently said everyone is replaceable. I’m passionate at my job and have been there three years. To hear how unimportant I am hurt. I took it to heart. I feel so awkward in my own skin so unhappy... So alone. I don’t know where to seek help. Not just from a clinic. I hate doctors and in my past they gave me lethal mixes and have killed me once. (honestly I wished I had stayed dead) The thought of suicide sounds better and better. They’ll find me when they evict me. So I have about 9 days to think about it. I’m tired of the swings feeling alone and unimportant. Like there is nothing left of this world. Deep down no one cares. I struggle on for family(to save face) but idk if that will keep me on this plane anymore. All I do is work work work. No enjoyment from life. No ease. No partnership. Nothing other then my little kitty and a small apt... Now I’m loosing everything. What little I had is going to be gone. I just rather be dead then continue this path. It sucks... I feel like I’m working towards nothing. I will never get on top. Life keeps punishing me. I can’t keep up this pain. Loosing everything sucks. It’s hard to find any sliver lining at this point. I’m tired.... 90% of me at this points wants to end it all. With death comes peace. A peace I’ve tasted before. No more rent/bills no more feeling inadequate and alone like I don’t belong.

I started meds and definitely felt better but we still fought a lot and I still felt impulses to break up but never argued or acted on it. I also have GAD.

Ex-bf has ADD anxiety and depression and smokes large amounts of pot to cope. Hates pharmaceuticals and therapy. He was not supportive of me starting meds and thought pot was all I needed. Didn't like me going to therapy because I should be going to him my partner with my troubles.He was intolerable when he wasn't high. Sweet as could be when he was which was most of the time. When he'd run out and couldn't get any I'd be on eggshells. He ran out and was incredibly irritable and said something very painful and I was crushed. I thought about it for about half an hour and then broke up with him.

Everyone has said it causes them to have really bad cravings. I am already *very* self conscious about my weight and currently sit at about 235lbs. I really do not want to gain any more (in fact if by some rare chance I lost weight on Seroquel that would be ideal) so I am trying to prep myself and my house before I start taking it. I plan on having my husband hide all of the snacks in our house so I cannot find them and I'll be stocking up on veggies and fruit to eat. I'll also be taking it at night close to bedtime so I am hoping that will also help mitigate some of the cravings (I really don't think I'll be getting out of bed to eat...). &amp;#x200B;Does this sound like I am doing the right thing?

I was always exhausted I longed for my couch. I had no motivation to clean my disaster of a house or car. 2 days after taking the new meds I cleaned out my car. It’s still covered in dog hair but not trash. I just went to the store and bought black hefty bags and am going to throw out all the stuff that’s been accumulating in my house over the years. I’ve been out with friends. I’ve been socializing more with coworkers and the brain fog has lifted making conversation easier. It has been years since I’ve felt this way. It’s amazing. I want to do as much as I possibly can while this lasts. I can’t help but feel it’ll be taken away and I want to be productive but not overly manic-productive. I’ve got all the windows open when I usually have the blinds drawn. It’s a beautiful day and my house needs airing out. The best part is my father who was against meds for years pointed out the fact that meds can plateau and you might need to switch them up. And then if those stop working you might need to switch back to the original meds. I was blown away. He did all of this research on his own.

46981,"Bipolar and PPD Hi everyone. I’m really really struggling today. I was diagnosed with bipolar ll in 2010. I gave birth to my first child in June of 2016. While pregnant I was on a very low dose of my medications I had taken before I became pregnant. We were not trying to get pregnant but ended up conceiving on our wedding night. After giving birth I started suffering from PPD. I hated my daughter wanted absolutely nothing to do with her. I sought treatment at a private hospital that had a mother-baby ppd program. I had my tubes tied to prevent another pregnancy and I thought that was a great idea. I thought I was one and done. After the tubal ligation I had a lot of other complications which lead to my having a full hysterectomy. I guess the reason that I’m struggling is because I so badly want to have another child. I want my daughter to have a sibling. I want to bless my home with another little blessing. My daughter is now the biggest joy in my life. Of course I still struggle with my bipolar. I’m on a constant roller coaster. I do know that if you have ppd with an early pregnancy you are bound to have it with one that follows. I honestly don’t know why I’m posting this and not sure if I will go through with posting it. I can’t talk to my husband about this because he definitely does not want another child.

46987,"Antidepressant-induced mania even while on a mood stabilizer? howdy partners I have Bipolar Type II and am currently taking 1250mg of Depakote. I'm extremely happy with how well my moods are regulated on this medication; I still have a full emotional range without experiencing devastating highs and lows. However I also have OCD and GAD and so my psychiatrist recently prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro. I've only been taking it for around a week but I'm concerned that it's triggering mania. My mood the last few days has been exactly what it is when I'm entering a manic episode: increased sex drive irate distractible and impulsive. I knew that antidepressant-induced mania was possible but I thought concurrently taking a mood stabilizer would circumvent that possibility. The fact that it's only been a week encourages me to attribute this to something else but nothing has happened to trigger anything like this and my moods have been so good as of late. It may be worthwhile to note that while my Depakote blood concentration is in the therapeutic range it's at the low end. Is it possible that the Lexapro is inducing a manic episode and my blood concentration levels aren't high enough to combat it? Or is a week too short of a time period to induce such a thing and I should just call this a bad week? Has anyone here experienced anything like this?thanks y'all",Bipolar

Is it going to happen? What will happen to my job if I have an episode? What does it mean for my treatment if it doesn’t work?” I know that I’m most likely fine but the sudden fear just makes me realize that no matter how stable I feel I always need to keep an eye out for the future.

Since then I’ve been keeping track of my moods with an app because my boyfriend also pointed out that it’s not the only time I’ve acted odd and I sometimes don’t notice it at all. I just started seeing a therapist and when I brought this up to her she told me the feeling has to last days to be mania. From what I’ve read hypomania doesn’t have to be long lasting.

Latuda made me feel like shit but I took it because it's the ""safest"" during pregnancy according to 2 psychiatrists I talked to.

A conclusion to my struggles ect ect. But that conclusion was ripped apart as I got the diagnosis. My so called happiness was taken away from me.

They always focus on the pessimistic side of things. And even in bright times they seem to spiral down into some negative memory that involves either depression or mania.

My stress tolerance is zero. I wake up energetic and motivated but that quickly turns into me being irritable irrational and frantic. It’s become so predictable and routine in the last two weeks I know how it goes. Every day around noon something small will set me off. It’s like this overwhelming amount of intense frantic emotion has been building up all morning and then it’s just too much. Suddenly I’ll be having a panic attack or bawling because of an overwhelming sense of despair and heartbreak. It physically breaks me down. As soon as it happens it ruins any chance of getting any more work done for the day (I work from home self-employed). Inevitably I force myself to take my “I give up” pill...Klonopin...and sit there crying shaking and paranoid until it kicks in. Then I lay in bed. I avoid my phone or computer because the slightest reminder of the responsibilities I have and am shirking sends me spiralling into a cycle of self/hatred panic and desperation to be rid of these expectations and responsibilities. This meltdown lasts until I am emotionally exhausted and end up just laying there...numb...except for the twinge of the feeling that suicidal ideation brings. I don’t know what feeling it is...relief that there could be a way out? That is quickly followed by a wave of guilt and hopelessness that hits me like a fucking brick for thinking of putting my family through that after everything they’ve done for me. Sometimes by supper time the whole ordeal is over and now I’m just depressed...it’s more manageable depression though. The kind that blinds me from seeing any hope in the future at all but that I can at least watch a meaningless tv show to distract myself. By 8:00 my mind starts racing again flooded with ideas on how to “fix” my life and do better tomorrow...I convince myself that if I just do _____ tomorrow maybe I can prevent it from escalating like it did today. Maybe meditation taking my clonazepam earlier setting more realistic goals minimizing any stressors journaling...or changing careers going to school moving getting a divorce...the list goes on. If I’m careful and lucky for the rest of the night nothing will shatter that illusion of hope for the next day. If not I cry myself to sleep. I’ve never had an episode that is this predictable. It makes it all the more frustrating that I can’t do anything about it...if I know what’s coming why can’t I do something to prevent it from escalating? Why can’t I cope better? I’m almost certain tapering off of the last antidepressant I was on (Trimipramine) triggered the episode...but I spent months tapering down and followed my psychiatrists directions to the tee. I know the Trimipramine was possibly suppressing some of the effects of my other medications as well and that the doses likely need to be tweaked now that I’m off it but my psychiatrist is gone for two more weeks. I will just have to wait it out. The timing is horrible I’m a full-time artist and I am in a show in two weeks that I need to finish preparing for. I need it to go well and if this continues I’m just not going to have the inventory to make it a profitable show...and damn do I need the money right now. Saying all that maybe it’s stress induced and coming off the antidepressant is just amplifying everything. If you read though all of that... thank you. I don’t have anyone to talk to right now. I do have a supportive partner and family but I can only put so much of my shit out there before I start feeling like a burden to them. Feeling like that doesn’t help anything.",Bipolar

I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (including Panic Disorder) Depression and PTSD. Every day I experience depression for most of the day and lately my baseline of anxiety is high all the time and at times has spiked so high that I have had mood swings (which is very uncommon for me). But the thing is my mood swings from being depressed to being angry irritated or just so unhappy and overwhelmed that I cry. Not happy or excitable. The medications I'm on are Gabapentin (prescribed for a chronic pain disorder not depression) Wellbutrin &amp; Buspar; I am convinced the Buspar is not doing enough for my anxiety but this week my doc increased my dose to 3 times a day ""to give it one last shot"". Then he said he wanted to add Lamictal into my daily routine because it would help with my mood swings. He didn't really explain much more than that. I told him I didn't feel like the mood swings were my problem because they are being caused by my anxiety which is not being controlled.**Does this story sound familiar to anyone?

After awhile I came off olanzapine and have only been on fluoxetinesince 2016. I also quit drinking in 2016. All that helped and I havebeen sober/stable for over 3 years now.One thing I've noticed since my psychotic episode is it's been reallyhard to make friends. I haven't made any new friends since then andI've drifted away from the ones I have. Part of this is just gettingolder (I'm 29) but I've noticed when I do meet people I wouldpotentially care about I'm just not that invested. I'm also slightlyfatigued the whole time. The fatigue doesn't affect me when I'm cycletouring but then we're talking 8+ hours of hard activity a day. Ican't possibly do that every day as a software developer. I cycleevery day commuting for about an hour and a half so I'm not inactive.I don't have much ambition any more and it really feels like life is passing me by. One of the most noticeable things about this is that when I was actively bipolar I would be fixated on people. I was in love with someone I'd say continuously for 9 years (not the same person). But now I haven't really been attracted to anyone since I was treated. Obviously the previous thing wasn't healthy; but nowadays I try to date but I just don't develop any attachment to them.

Counselling is really expensive and I used to just get it on the NHS. Not sure how to approach looking for it myself.

That morphed into a sort of word-salad where it'd take me awhile to come up with words that were on the tip of my tongue or I'd say the completely wrong word. (example as I just was typing this! ""Diagnosed relatively recently""I had to stop and think how to phrase that because I wanted to type ""soon-ish"" but could not for the life of me remember the word ""relatively"".)At work today and it's been rough. Well that's an understatement. I feel like I'm literally having to corral my brain. Cannot concentrate AT ALL. Making really stupid mistakes.

47047,"Brief mourning period for 4 months of stability Well it happened again. Hubris is indeed my downfall.I tried taking Vyvanse again at a lower dose than the previous dose that made me manic. And I was OK for about a week before the symptoms started showing up. Namely lying (about anything) and some risky behaviors. Luckily not drinking and drugs but I did take a hit off of a vape pen which I know is super bad for my brain (no matter how much analog weed I can smoke.) I decided on Saturday to stop taking it.And Sunday I blew up.We were having a disagreement about how to best spend our day on Sunday. I wanted to stay Very Busy and he wanted to take his time. Which is no big deal at all and shouldn't have been what set me off. But it did and I was in the History of Pain.My History of Pain is a mindset I get into when manic brain meets remotely challenging parts of my relationship. Suddenly I am the victim of circumstance and have been forever and will be forever: He doesn't love me he's shown how he doesn't love me in every action and on top of that I don't deserve love for how terrible I am and the terrible things I've done.And then I'm hitting myself in the head over and over and over and bashing my skull into anything I can get my hands on.And then it subsides and I'm crying and he wants to get away from me and I don't understand.And then it's quiet and he's mad and I'm still crying and it seems like I'll never stop and we'll never be happy again.And then it's quiet and he's quiet and I'm quiet.And then we're in the car and talking about the news and all I want is to be held but that's asking too much too soon.I should've trusted my body sooner- there were warning signs that the Vyvanse was going to push me over the edge and I went willingly. And why? Because Vyvanse would help me achieve my goals surely but at the cost of myself and him.Everything has a cost and this cost was too high. Sure he and I are OK now but there's the threat of so many next times and eventually he'll walk.",Bipolar
47048,I want to go to crisis counseling but I know there’s nothing they can do So I might be manic idk for sure but this weekend I partied a lot and did hard drugs and my sleep was all fucked and when I finally got some sleep it was full of horrible disturbing nightmares. I’m so impatient and time is moving so fucking slowly. Idk if I’m manic I feel fine inside but I think my partying behavior is a little off. I kept hurrying my friends to get to the next party to take more shots faster etc etc and they were like dude what is wrong with you? But they were just moving so fucking slow. I’ve been exercising and really paranoid my parents or the government can read my phone. My college has crisis counseling and I’ve been before when i was too manic to take a midterm and it was helpful because they wrote me a note to take the midterm at a different date. I feel like I should maybe go again honestly because the nightmares are so gross and making me scared to sleep. I should probably wait until the drugs are out of my blood first though. But anyway I want to go to crisis counseling but idk what they could do for me. I can’t get medication because the school pharmacy doesn’t take my insurance and everywhere in town is either not accepting new patients or doesn’t take my insurance. It’s literally hopeless there’s absolutely no way for me to access medication. If I go to crisis counseling all they can do is determine if I’m actually manic I guess but realistically there’s nothing they can do to actually help me. I have a hard time even believing I’m bipilar I know this behavior isn’t normal but I don’t feel crazy or weird I feel normal I think my behaviors are just a little bit out there right now.

47051,"Bipolar w/ ASMR (sidenote on New Age culture &amp; spirituality) Anyone else experiences ASMR on top of your manic episodes? I have type 1 ASMR and Bipolar 1 and I've found it to be a deadly combination. When manic I'll come up with these metaphysical laws anddespite how compulsive and irrational as fuck they are get this huge flood of stimulation from the back of my head all the way to my feet that makes it seem like the universe is confirming my understanding. It got to a point in my development where I believed I was given the date of the end of the world and that the afterlife was split 80% enslaved and 20% saved. Months later my life has blown into ruins and what was once seeming so inexplicably clear now seems psychotic. Is there a lesson to be had from all of this or can it all be written off as manic thinking? Sidenote: what's extra complicating on top of all of this is the thirst that new age culture seems to have on pondering spirituality and metaphysics. On the one hand it's nice that there is a community (albeit niche) that embraces neurodivergence and ""out of the box"" thinking. On the other I'm finding it dangerous because of the community's willingness to affirm these manic thoughts that Im having as reality. The twofold affirmation had me push towards accepting all these thoughts as absolute truths and burning bridges with people that wouldn't accept what I was experiencing. This ended up being a lot of fucking people and I ended up homeless. Yes I understand that ASMR is a scientifically controversial subject but it seems there are enough people out there that experience the symptoms of it to talk about it.

47056,"Struggling to get the help I need! Around the age of 19/20 I began struggling badly with my mental health. I began drinking heavily doing drugs and staying up all night on my PC. Having just enough sleep to sober up a little so I could go to work and live a seemingly normal life.One morning I was on the transfer bus from the car park to my office and as it pulled in to the stop before my office I got off the bus and found myself on a train to the seaside. I love the seaside it is where I go when I need to calm my mind. I texted work letting them know I wouldn’t be in work today then went and found a place to sit! Today was different though instead of calming thoughts and feeling refreshed my head was spinning with thoughts like walking into the sea or stepping in front of a train anything to just end it all.In a panic I ran back to the train station getting on the first train home. 35 minuets into the journey the train stopped. A person had stepped out in front of the train I was on. My mind was all over at the time I was thinking it was a sign. I thought about it for the next 3 hours and had basically talked myself into doing it. By time I had reached my car I had managed to buy enough packets of pills to take my own life. I started to take them I had taken about 100/150 pills and then in a split second I changed my mind. I ran back to the train station looking for help. I was crying so much I couldn’t even get my words out I kind of just threw my empty packets at the feet of the first ‘official’ person I found. Within a few hours I was in hospital and my mum was there. The next few days I had explained what had happened. My mum didn’t believe me she refused to believe it. She would say things like ‘but you’re always so happy’ ‘you have no reason to do something like that’ or ‘it just doesn’t make sense’. So that was the first time I really knew I had a problem work organised for me to see a councilor. I had 6 sessions but I felt like I was getting nowhere. So I stopped going.I went to my local doctor’s office and they gave me some pills. Then some more pills and again some more. Most of the time I would just stopped taking my pills as they started causing me problems with my job. A few years later I felt like I was no better so I decided to start therapy again and once again I got nowhere the therapist would call me by the wrong name or show up late. So I stopped going. After a few months my doctor sent me to a new therapist it was here that my therapist told me she believed I was Bipolar. I felt like I had answers and I could fix it on my own. So I stopped going.A few weeks later I relocated to be with my boyfriend over 100 miles from ‘home’ and from my Doctors. But I felt great my mind was distracted by all the new things going on I felt happy and normal for once. Boy was I wrong!! Once everything had settled down it hit me and hard! Self-harm was on my mind ALL the time! It still is but since moving to a new house I feel like the change is distracting me right now and everything will come back once I am not so busy. I also feel like I am not good enough and that I am alone despite having an amazing boyfriend and a great job.I know that I need to go to my new doctors and get some help but at the same time I don’t want to because I am scared! I don’t know much or anything about the treatment for being Bipolar but if the road is as rocky as it was when I was being treated just for depression I am not sure I could cope.I promised my boyfriend I would try and get help and in my mind I want to but only when I physically can’t.

I was curled up in a ball for a good 45 minutes crying until my eyes were dried out later that night. And then one thing lead to the next I was having flashbacks from my emotionally abusive mother.

Sorry if it’s a bit long .Basically after about 5 years of therapy at multiple hospitals with multiple people I got diagnosed with bipolar 2. It was such a relief to know what was wrong with me and why these sudden breakdowns and well “mental” episodes had been happening to me. It fit and was comforting having confirmation that it’s not me or who I am. I have bad depressive episodes roughly every two years always when I’m perfectly content with my life no events no reasonable triggers nothing. Manics have been less visible to my hospital as well I was off doing “far more important things” E.g my now I look back on it completely incoherent master piece of an application to a prestigious design school. Instead of attending appointments. Although they did see a couple days which confirmed to them bipolar. In between those times I’m just normal happy average George. So getting to the point my second admittion to the priory hospital ( private so not related to my previous treatment) happened last year during a depressive episode. In one session my consultant told me he didn’t think it was bipolar. I asked why his response was nothing more than” you don’t look like someone with bipolar” What the fuck does that mean?!? So he told me in his opinion it’s BPD. Disregarding my previous YEARS under the nhs who All agreed on bipolar. Now I’m out patient and have been back home nearly a year and doing really well despite Having had loss and a difficult home life. he’s referred me to a therapist. Turns out she only treats personality disorders. I had my first session with her and she went through the criteria of what is needed for a diagnosis of bpd. ( that’s what he had changed my diagnosis to on my notes!!!) I’ve met him maybe 5 times over two years including inpatient stays. Now with bipolar I do have the symptoms she is describing but only when I have episodes. When I made it clear it’s only in episodes that these are present and my episodes tend to be separated by months or years where none of these symptoms exist she scoffed and said that doesn’t matter and ticked them off anyway. Im finding it hard having people try to make out that the way I am when I’m ill is a problem with my personality and therefore something I can control. I came to this subreddit as I’m hoping you understand how horrible it is for someone to 1. Make out like you have control over this by changing your thinking. 2. And taking away the only thing that makes sense of why I do and say and feel these intense almost out of body episodes. I know full well it’s not like me to go out for three days and not sleep going to random places not having any sense of danger and losing who I am. I’m not putting anyone with bpd down. It’s just a very different experience when it feels chemical. I would choose bipolar over bpd any day because I have long periods of time of being normal.

I am sorry if it's longI was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder in late August after a manic then psychotic break that ended with 5 days in the psych ward. I did some severely out-of-character and even violent things while in the ward. I have trouble looking back and thinking what I could have done differentlymy husband and sponsor took me to the emergency room and I said (out of my mind) ""I think that's part of it"" to the question ""does this have to do with harm to yourself or others."" Then everything escalated: the security guards grabbed me and moved me to a holding room. I nearly passed out from the anxiety spike. My brain was making me talk to everyone and learn their names I think as a coping mechanism. Eventually after a long time in a room with scary doctor people (to my scared mind) coming in and out I was driven handcuffed by police to the psych place. I am told by my therapist and friends that I am very smart and that that made things a little worse for me. My brain had SO MANY false narratives going and not only was I manic but I was in such fight or flight I ended up in seclusion rooms twice. This as you can imagine made everything tons worse. I felt so isolated. I feel traumatized still. I went back to work right after. My sponsor stopped talking to me completely and I don't have a large support group even though I have been feeling a little more connected to people day-to-day. I want to go back and change everything; I want to believe that the right thing happened; but being completely ignorant to what I could do I said things that led to the worst situation for me. The ward experience seemed to make everything a lot worsethe delusions the mania the disconnectedness the alienation overmedicating etc. I am now pretty stable and on a mood stabilizer hydroxyzine and a sleep med. How do you all cope with decisions that you or your loved ones made for you that you wish went differently? How do you deal with the trauma of hospitalization? I know everyone has different even positive experiences. Mine was not that. It's hard not to let it eat at me and get angry. Thanks for listening.",Bipolar
47077,"When did you realize your bipolar disorder hit a new level? I was diagnosed at 15 and began my adventures with finding the right medications. I’m 32 and I’m still on my adventure as frustrating as that can be sometimes. It was about ten years ago that I hear bipolar disorder is a progressive mental illness. I scoffed at it- I had been at the “same level” of mental illness from the start. Then all of a sudden three years ago all hell broke loose. I became insanely manic. I was hallucinating and ocd tendencies came out of nowhere. I was convinced that the planes that crashed into the 9/11 towers were going to crash into my home and the only way to stop them was to lock and unlock and lock my door again. After what felt like forever that manic phase passed and I had the realization that I had hit a new level of my mental illness. My manic phases have become a monster of their own- I was never nearly this bad before. The lows are deeper the suicidal thoughts have gotten more frequent (though I would never ever follow through- I love my kids too much). Everything thing feels so much BIGGER if that makes sense. What was now something in the back of my head as a teenager “Yeah I have bipolar disorder but I never even think about it I’m too busy living my life. “ Has now become my biggest priority to keep in check and it’s almost all I think about. Managing my mental health is first and foremost and uncontrollable no matter how much medication I take. Has anyone had the same experience? If so when did you notice your bipolar disorder becoming “stronger” for lack of better words.",Bipolar

47081,"A mother’s letter about forgiveness and psychsosis I just wanted to share a letter my mother (schizoaffective/BP I) wrote to me (bp II).I have been here under many different usernames but the gist of it is that my mother who I love with all of my heart has been psychotic many times while I have grown up and the rest of my family has frequently abandoned her. She seems sometimes evil and terrifying and I can’t blame those who are less educated for being fearful.But I feel that this letter she wrote me encompasses how human we still are in psychosis. Just because our reality is different doesn’t mean we are any less human or have any less capacity for love or caring. You are never less than simply because the reality around you changes. I will say I am immensely traumatized by my mothers psychosis and wouldn’t wish it on anyone or anyone’s loved ones but I would give up anything to be there for my mother and to have lived this life being able to love and care for her.Her letter:I've wanted to write about this for a long time but the memory is so special to me I wanted the writing to do it justice. But it just hit me that it is a good birthday sending.Do you remember those flesh colored-flats you had? They triggered my (manic) thought ""walk a mile in Lilychickadees shoes."" I bought some just like them at Walmart and would wear them when I wanted to keep you with me in spirit. Because every time I go manic 'They' always say ""Lilychickadee is the strong one.""Last spring I had maybe three months when I was manic but not in the hospital. You dad wouldn't let me drive (smart man) so I took the bus everywhere. One day I had a caseworker appointment in Edinburg. I took the bus to the depot in downtown M and from there another bus to E. I told the driver to tell me when we got to FG. He did and I got off. I didn't realize I got off on J. Do you know how far J is from the Expressway where My hospital is located on FG? Miles. hahahaha.So I started walking down FG. In my mania it seemed as though the expressway moved further away from me as I walked! I'm very serious about that. Suddenly that purple purse I was carrying like a baby transformed into you (I used to carry you everywhere when you were a baby and the way that feels apparently doesn't leave a mother's memory.) I was carrying you keeping in mind how I need to walk in your shoes. I was so so so distraught by the thought of you traumatized when taking care of me in my mania/psychosis. I walked and walked and walked and walked. And walked while Expressway moved further away. You never left my mind as I carried you and walked. It turned into a way for me to prove my love for you after all you've suffered for me. I thought I would walk and carry you like this forever if it meant you could experience some ease after struggling so hard. I barely made it before TT closed and my caseworker (who I had never seen before) took so long it was the night before we left for her to drive me home. She took Expressway and do you know every single light: car lights traffic lights expressway signs and billboards businesseseverything that had a light that light looked incandescent like you see psychedelic colors portrayed. I rode with my mouth open! All I could think is that heaven had come to earthas in the Lord's Prayer: ""Thy Kingdom come.""I felt &lt;God&gt; giving his approval for how unquestionably and unfalteringly I proved my love for you.

47083,"Lamictal withdrawal severity change over time? Hi so three times in the past week and a half I’ve missed my Lamictal dose. Last Wednesday and Thursday night I threw up all my meds because of Latuda nausea. Last night I forgot to pick up my Lamictal refill from the pharmacy so went without it.Normally I can’t go more than four hours past taking my nightly Lamictal dose of 400 mg without horrible and intense withdrawal. It puts me in a severe mixed episode with suicidal ideation and planning. Every time I throw up my meds or miss a dose I prepare for some of the worse hours of my life until I can take my dose again.I’ve been on it since 2006 and have been at this high dose for probably at least 8 years. The weird thing is... none of the withdrawal symptoms happened these last three times. Maybe I’m just numbed our from my other meds (Latuda 120 mg Seroquel XR 300 mg Lithium 1200 mg). Or could this be a sign that it’s not even working in my system anymore so I wouldn’t miss it? Anyone know if those other drugs lower Lamictal doses?

(it's Depakote) then I call back the Dr and they say no it's in there but they will call and NOTHING ever gets done.

Worst thing I did was throw a cheeseburger into the sink when I got some bad news about my dog. So we had sex last night and afterwards when we were cuddling in bed he kissed me and said “I’m so glad you’re back.

49477,"I'm coming out of a hypomanic episode and need to talk about it. I've been hypomanic for the last 3 weeks. I'm medicated and I'm teetotal etc so it was relatively minor. But fuck me does the depression hit me like a ton of bricks. It's more physical than mental at first. My limbs get heavy. I have zero energy to get up and do simple things. I procrastinate. Skip a few meals. Not brush my teeth. Leave a chore that needs doing. Then in a few days I'll feel all the mental affects coming in. If I'm lucky I'll just be comatose for a month. But if a mixed state comes along then it's panic attacks anxiety despair and suicidal ideation. Fingers crossed it's just depression.The hypomania was alright this time around. I have spent a bit too much worked a bit too hard overshared a bit too much socialised a bit too much. But no real damage this time. It was intense but kind of pleasant. But I can feel the dip is going to be huge. This is anecdotal but it feels like if my mania is under control (no psychosis and no mixed state) the depression part is deeper. Feel kind of quietly melancholic on an epic scale. If that makes any sense.It's going to be a slog for the next month. I should be happy I've got things under control I suppose.

Long story short we got into my previous diagnosis’ and I told her mild depression adhd and anxiety. Yes these are true but however the one that is relevant to this post that popped up that I didn’t know was bipolar. I end up contacting my previous psychiatrist because I did not recall him saying this ( I swear he didn’t ) and he said yes but it is unspecified. He diagnosed me because of my constant irritability and made a point to say today I may be in remission because I wasn’t as snappy as before. I honestly Just thought the things he would say would rub me the wrong way. Next week he’ll do a full evaluation. A few years back another therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder I forgot which but I remember her say something of me being manic. I honestly don’t think she’s working anymore but I wanted this evaluation at the time because I believed I was bipolar starting around 13-16 years old. I had my reasons for it. Fast forward to last year my last psychologist said I was misdiagnosed and it was just adhd/add. I had mentioned my sex drive/hyper sexuality (which I may speak on in another post) my impulsive urges to do things mood swings that can be intense etc etc she said it was just a mixture of my depression and adhd. So now here I am and thinking back to the things I’ve done before and do now. These things I am trying to control and make sense of mainly the hyper sexuality I started to wonder if I was just a sex addict because of my habits and started looking into help to stop these things but yet my only problem is when I’m in the mood lol.

49486,Trying to fix all the damage I caused Long story short I was diagnosed with depression back in 2021 after a rough year and 2 failed suicide attempts December 2021. Physically and mentally I made a full recovery by May 2022 my ex of 7 years cheated on me in June and I surprisingly dealt with it really well. I’d been off work March-September due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again I dealt with it well. I returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the office. I’m a confident bloke but I was nervous AF! I spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me fast forward a few hours later and she’d requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting. We met shortly after for a date and it was like we’d know each other years best date ever. From this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally. The connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal. I asked her to be my girlfriend in October and she was genuinely excited about it this made me realise I’d found someone special. Shortly after this I had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till January she was my rock my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. I’m 29 and I’ve cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term. I thought I was incapable but this woman changed that and she’s the first I’ve ever loved and hopefully the last. On 02/01/23 the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news. From this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably nothing too rapid. 05/01/23 I went over to my Nan’s house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day. I walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor this was the day I deteriorated rapidly. I needed my girlfriend desperately for support but I was just far too much to deal with. I wasn’t just depressed this time it was different. I was awake 4-8 days regularly and would only sleep when I’d black out. I was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head. Because it was my girlfriend who had become distant I stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much I love her. She wasn’t leaving me she just needed space and I could cope on my own. 20/02/23 2 men tried to steal my car and I managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process. I was hit 11 times with a knuckle duster and 40+ times by the other bloke with just his fists. I was left with 4 skull fractures fractured orbital bone broken nose and broke jaw. I’m an ex professional Muay Thai fighter so I’m used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different although I now have slurred speech blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally. I started to have panic attacks and I was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis. Again I continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away shortly after this she ended things. She made the right decision because I was horrendous and I was dragging her down. This present day I’m on the mend now and I barely remember any of it the days all merged as one. It feels like someone else has been living/wrecking my life and last week I woke up and have been given it back. I’m now trying to fix all the damage I’ve caused I’ve lost most of my friends family and the love of my life. I’ll never give up on her but for now I can only love her from a distance. I hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but I also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before. I’ve spoke to numerous Dr’s in and outside the hospital but have just been dismissed as I struggle explaining it and play it down. Thanks in advance and apologies for the long read,Bipolar

49489,"Chicken or the egg? discussion! Hi everyone! I have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time and I hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. Maybe some of you are wondering the same.The question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace I wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out OR by the bipolar itself so from within. Like I'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship some annoying interactions things at work etc. Or I start stressing out because of a shift towards manic? This is where I'm lost: at times I think that because of the diagnosis I overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? But we don't live in a sterile bubble life is life and always something is happening.For context: during my manic state I start pacing mind racing increaced heart rate twitches and intrusive thoughts. I start walking fast through streets almost running away from this and I end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if I'm being thrown into their lives as if I live through their experience I imagine how they act what happened in their childhood flashes into their daily routine interactions frustrations and happiness. And then I look at a window on some far away building start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way. Then I get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. Then it's my own memories of the past then imagining my own future and so on. The experience is intense and doesn't stop. When it wears off eventually I regain focus calm and ability to think clearer. Happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week maybe 2(depending how I deal with it after the peak. It's not the most intense that happened but I don't wanna go in even more details because this is already TL;DR Edit: I have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and I was legit worried that this time I'm definitely not making it through.

My parents never ""agreed"" (as if there's something to agree on a medical diagnosis) so I was unmedicated for most of my life so far. This gave me a lot of time to figure when a phase was coming what triggers it but also a lot of time to do stuff I shouldn't which hindered me greatly. Because of that I only started living on my own when I was 24 and that's when I started medication. To help with all this I have PCOS (which triggers depression) and long periods (which trigger anemia) so when I get my period I get depressive episodes AND I am physically exhausted and depleted. Which causes me to sleep more which causes me to go further into depression. My bf does his best to understand but it's all a bit beyond his grasp. My parents still don't recognize my situation so they are of no support for me. I don't have many friends and only one of them is actually supportive but she has a rough life and is usually busy with lots of work or something similar. So I'm on my own. I want to straighten up my sleep schedules but I know I can only do that by decreasing the amount of sleep drastically which will trigger a maniac episode.

I just received a letter from this new place saying my transfer of care request has been denied because my psychiatrist stated I was stable so they are discharging me to my GP now. This can’t be right surely? not only because I have bipolar and need regular appointments with a psychiatrist to monitor/manage my medication etc but I’m also unemployed and the mental health team were just about to help me with preparing to slowly get back to work starting with volunteering they told me this new clinic would help me with this and now that won’t be happening I feel completely left in the lurch.

Basically what it says in the title.In theory I know exercise helps with symptoms and I like going to the gym when I'm not in the depths of depression. However when I'm depressed it's nearly impossible for me to motivate myself to go even semi-consistently. I get stuck doing nothing. I have trouble getting myself to put my gym clothes on let alone actually walking there and completing a workout.Also I don't experience much if any of the usual pleasure I get after I work out (normally I'd feel better afterwards) when I'm depressed so it's pretty hard to convince myself to do it because ""I'll feel better later"".I've tried going for longer walks and other stuff but if I'm honest dragging myself around my city in the rain alone with my dark thoughts doesn't help much. I go out most days with my dog but when it gets bad I can't even begin to face it.I know I sound like I'm being lazy and dramatic but I'm serious. I really can't stand the idea of getting up putting on my clothes putting on my shoes getting my dog ready finding my keys finding my phone putting on my coat locking up going down the stairs in my apartment building walking for 40 minutes climbing the stairs again then unlocking my door and going in. I get stuck between steps and find myself outside alone in the cold too sad to walk home or staring at the stairs (pun) in my building unable to drag myself up them.I get psychomotor slowing when I'm really bad.

My wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. I'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. I blamed myself but it doesn't change anything. She also left me with both of our kids who I love a lot they're 10 and 15. We've decided to slow date again and see if we can actually be together but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. Yeah I know it's a really bad sign but I have to try for me.Now: I can't stop sobbing all the time. Like hard hurt sobbing. I'm in therapy and I'm on meds. I'm not actively suicidal but I am starting to worry that I might be slipping into a suicidal trance. I think about it daily and I keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it. I don't really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage there's a lot there and a LOT of people would tell me don't give her a second chance including my 15 year old.

No manic outbursts or emotional ones at all. We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities.

They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional.

The work itself isn’t hard or boring. But I just don’t even want to work. But then when I’m home I don’t want to be there either and I feel like a piece of shit for laying in bed all day. Idk I’m not gonna do anything but it’s been *really* hard to want to be here anymore. I don’t want to tell my therapist cuz tbh a stay in a psych ward sounds substantially boring and lonely. And I would miss my partner too much. And my cat. I *think* about stuff I should/could do to improve my life and it’s an endless cycle: thinking of all the great things I should do tomorrow (exercising rearranging my bedroom to be more comfortable whatever). Then I wake up and do none of it. And feel bad all day. Sometimes I wish I was manic just so I could feel something other than shitty. But mania sucks too so?? Sorry I’ll get off the soap box now I just wanted to scream my sadness into the Internet void.",Bipolar

Let alone self care like long showers and making a nice meal. Everything feels rushed like time is running out. I'm never fully present when doing things and i always find my mind wandering and not focusing on the task at hand. Mentally i'm scattered with just about everything and executive function is non existent. I want my life back and I want to feel like I have time.

49550,"Being the crazy lady I’m 61 now and was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 28. It’s quite severe I get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality. Despite taking meds religiously all these years and trying so many different combos I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things. Nowadays I mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked. I’ve lost friends like many of us. That irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet you know?I just wondered if anyone could relate.",Bipolar
49551,Vent: I just wasted 2/3’s of my savings during my 2nd manic episode can anyone relate? Just so disappointed that I (25M) spent 2/3’s of my savings on bullshit. Mainly clothes books and random items from local stores that I never use. I worked a lot of different jobs to earn that money since the beginning of college (7 years ago) and in a little less than 2 months most of it is gone. Can’t even afford to join my family on a vacation to visit my mothers homeland because it’s too expensive for me… And being consistent with a job while my meds are kicking my ass energy wise is extremely difficult. Just feeling down about my situation I know it’s not forever but damn.

49553,Anybody have prosopagnosia/facial blindness? Wondering if there’s a link between that and bipolar. If you’re not sure what I mean it’s when you have a hard time remembering what someone looks like/recognizing people. Like if I see a friend in public I’m never sure if it’s actually them or if you ask me to describe someone’s features I’d have no idea. Actually a good example is after yoga class I won’t be able to recognize which person is the teacher after everyone has left the studio— so I try to memorize the teacher’s tattoos or outfit color so I know who to thank after class.

I had a severe (for me) hypomanic episode followed by a severe depressive episode but now am back on meds picking up the pieces and getting back to a feeling of normalcy. I know that the stress of dealing with my addict ex plus the stress of the divorce absolutely contributed to the severity of these episodes so I’m hopeful that moving forward I will continue to be well managed.

Ever since my psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar Disorder I have been suffering from serious short term memory loss. I’ve never had the most attentive brain but before I started taking my medication/had someone to talk to I remembered things too well if that makes sense. For example: my fiancé and I were talking last night and I pulled out my calculator and typed one number in and then all of a sudden I couldn’t remember what we were talking about 2 minutes prior. Then I asked what we were talking about and he gave me the most concerned look. I know he isn’t mad at me but worried. It’s happening so often I’ve started writing everything down. Like everything conversations tasks reminders messages I need to reply back to. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m currently taking Busprion 15 mg 3x a day Hydroxyzine 50 mg 3x a day Aripiprazole 10 mg 1x a day and Buspar 150 mg 1x a day. Also I work a very high stress job.

49560,Dealing with this condition. Hello everyone! This is my first time posting in this group. I was diagnosed with bp2 after struggling for years with depression and supposedly mania also. But I was also diagnosed with adhd a little over a month ago. Both felt like I was diagnosed relatively quickly. Idk if that’s a good or bad thing. My depression has always been bad especially in my teens but my best friend died of suicide when I was 18 and it got worse from there. Im currently 21 and have no will or desire to pretty much live( not suicidal I think) life just seems pointless when im always depressed I have zero motivation to do anything. Im in therapy but it feels like it’s not helping. I was recently put on vyvanse to help with my supposed adhd diagnosis. It’s helped with my motivation a little but hasnt really done much. And every anti depressant/psychotic has either made me worse or done the bare minimum which is keeping me alive. Ive been on 5+ different medications since my bp2 diagnosis 2 years ago. Ive had maybe 2 or 3 hypo manic phases since my diagnosis but their never anything more than a day or 2 of euphoria and more motivation and a splash of poor impulsive decision making. I don’t really know where I’m going with this other than how the fuck do you guys deal with this? My lifes been at a complete stand still since I was around 16-17. I have no diploma no job and not a single desire to pretty much be a human at this point. Sorry for the long post I just figured I’d give an insight to what life is for me. Any help/advice is much appreciated since I feel so alone and like no one understands.,Bipolar

He told me that I need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea. All of my symptoms point towards that instead of mental illness. What the hell!

I’m sure many of you can imagine the drugs and “fun” we had on our high. I ended up pregnant. He came down hard and I started having suicidal thoughts from all the drama being bipolar entails. I had an abortion. It was the abortion or drive off a bridge. Even his catholic family had choice words for me that made me feel all the more trapped.I cleaned up and went back to college and started traveling more. He went to rehab 2ce. I wrote him while in rehab the 2nd time. He was kicked out of rehab for acting on his hyper-sexuality. Him and the lady became a couple and had a daughter. I leave him alone because now he’s diagnosed and I took a few college courses to educate myself on mental illness. I knew he wasn’t in full control. He would call me from fake numbers in the middle of the night and we’d talk never meeting up. His lady caught on and would call and confront me. I sent her receipts that it’s him after me. Eventually he stopped contacting me knowing I’d snitch.It’s been 8 years and I’m now diagnosed and medicated myself. I recently had my own daughter. I’ve been thinking about him and looked him up. He reached out to me 2 years ago right before I was diagnosed and I responded with his arrest record.As I’m looking into him I find out he was in a coma from going in to cardiac arrest. He’s learning to walk talk and move his hands again. It looks like he lost a finger. His family hasn’t posted any information about how or why. Also my daughter has the same name as his mom totally forgot his moms name and my spouse picked the name.I’m in this fog of wanting to reach out but also why? We are living separate lives. It’s been almost a decade! I questioned if it was real love or the mania for so long..My spouse and father of my daughter is a good guy. He’s stable and loving. He isn’t jealous and we have talked about the ex in the past. We have agreed that we chose each other and not the ex’s. However he will never understand what not being in full control is like.It’s how I ended up on this sub. Looking to see if I was as crazy as I felt.

So I thought to myself maybe I don’t need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad plan…For the last few days I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. Back on my lithium… I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be “sedated” to some degree. I shouldn’t complain because at least I have stability.

The constant questions of ""what's wrong with you"" to ""why are you like this""When I try to explain to my family members that I have a disorder they turn around and say ""don't speak that over your life.""

Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way dear beloved and most precious electronic journal I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings nonetheless.How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much but baring mental health professionals I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that of course is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.I have messy hair messy eyes my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!) I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job we call it work because you do motions in a job but we call the motions “work” because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing- but you know that feeling you get in your chin your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions to me seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e. anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die looking at places where you could hang yourself feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing imagining a knife to the throat thinking about swerving into traffic travelling and not feeling anything kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything doubting everything you do every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs anxiety is depression anxiety is the antithesis of life of enjoyment of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety” as this is obviously a corrupted poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e. anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

49582,"Urge to trigger mania I recently had the most intense manic episode of my life and went on a whirlwind of euphoria rage etc... I had to miss work several days because I couldn't handle it and my mind was racing constantly. I'm relatively sure it was caused by me taking a few adderall pills (not sure how much or the mg) because that's when everything started. I crashed super hard and I'm so tired now and can't even indulge in my passions. When I was manic I was able to draw for 12 straight hours and then go to work the next day without even sleeping. I can't even pick up a pencil now and I'm so frustrated with myself. I want to be able to do that again and it's making me want to buy some adderall from a friend of mine but I know that it's not gonna do me any good in the end. I just wish I could do the things I like to do and not feel like shit - I miss being on top of the world.

I played instruments since I was in grade 4 I was a very talented musician( not saying that in a pretenious way). Music was my life I was part of jazz music programs inside and out of school wind orchestras scored perfectly on all my NYSSMA performances ( New York State Music Association) even skipped a few levels because I was advanced. And part of All County band programs(a hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people). I then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college I however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years performing for presidential speeches Veterans day and St.Patrick day parades in NYC played half time shows at NFL games etc. I used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me sure I wasn't the best in the world but the raw emotion I put into my music was just a feeling I can't even explain now it's been over 4 years since I've touched sn instrument and I just feel so empty about it.

I wrote down my important login information. I've been talking to my dad and my sister about the gist of everything.

I'm hoping to fill my meds as soon as my insurance lets me (up to 5 days before the days supply ends) so I can build up extra. Maybe try to get a vacation override or something towards the end. I'm gonna work some extra shifts to build up some money. I gotta get Annie to the the vet for her annual exam and refills of her phenobarbital. And ask the vet if she will authorize an early refill or prescribe a larger volume so there's more of a buffer zone for her (because her seizures are both heartbreaking and terrifying at the same time).I have so much to do!

A miscarriage I still mourn and how I never told him that I named her. The depth of complexity and severity of my nerve skin and gut problems and how much money has been spent on them.

The lashing out volatile nature hopelessness he feels hurts me horribly because I know from experience there is nothing I can do. He’s either ignoring me or can’t leave me alone and I don’t blame that on him whatsoever. Every time he hurts my feelings rn I have to remind myself that 3 years ago I was the same way.

They've never actually gone away. Even on days I don't record as having one I low-key always have pain just it's at a threshold tolerable enough I can for tye most part ignore it. But most days of the week I've got headache and/or the front of my ""brain"" feels like it's being prickled with pins and needles (not in pain those thats reserved for my temples and the icepicks behind my eyes) it makes my brain mush and makes me feel physically weak.

49670,"I don't like making plans because I don't trust my future self's mental state Sorry if this has already been talked about a lot but I just realized that this is why I don't like making plans too far out into the future.One of my friends recently asked me if I wanted to go to a concert in August. I love the musician and I'm sure I'd enjoy the show. But my initial honest reaction was ""I don't even know who I'll be by then."" I didn't say that out loud but it was a clarifying moment. Does anyone else have this issue? (Probably.)An added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky disorganized or unreliable and I'm not saying I'm definitively NOT those things. Bums me out though. I can use a calendar app I swear. I just do not know how I'll be feeling a month from now. And a bunch of my friends are very ""type A"" so it sort of compounds the issue because they love having full calendars and planning hangs weeks in advance. (Dorks.)Anyway I think I'll buy tickets to this thing even if I don't end up being able to go. It's just annoying I have to incorporate this into my decision-making.

49672,"Are things going to get any better? So... I usually don't post anything on Reddit but here we go.About eight months ago I was diagnosed with BP2. I've struggled with mental health issues all my life (anxiety depression) and developed PTSD at a pretty young age. After a few years of fluctuating emotions I went to see a psychologist and I got my diagnosis. I was also diagnosed with asperger's syndrome back in 2019.I've been on a mood stabilizer (lamictal) since I was diagnosed and it's made things easier for me but exam season (last year of high school) is coming up and I lowkey feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm experiencing mixed moods every other week I can't really sleep anymore and every day I'm torn between ignoring everyone around me freaking out or acting friendly because I know I shouldn't take my own mental illness out on anyone. I'm either tired stressed occasionally productive or filled with a kind of self-loathing and sadness that I can't even begin to describe. I'm worried I'll be thrown straight into a depressive episode soon because stress is my biggest trigger. Very few people (two of my friends and my immediate family) know that I'm bipolar and I don't even want to tell **them** about how I feel right now. I think a lot of people on here can relate to that crushing feeling that you're a burden to your loved ones even when they tell you you're not. I considered the possibility that things might get better if I told someone but I just don't have the energy and I don't want to let people in because I'm ashamed that I'm losing control. Explaining how I feel to someone is difficult (asperger's yay) and there aren't many people I trust with my emotions. The people I trust are the ones I don't want to burden.I wanted to ask does it get any easier? Not to board the self-pity train or anything but I'm not even 20 and thinking about the future terrifies me. I don't want to fall apart and fake that I'm okay every time a problem arises. I don't want to isolate myself because I'm scared of affecting people. I don't want to experience all these episodes over and over again. I just... don't know what to do right now.Also if anyone has any advice on how to keep going and staying productive I'd really appreciate it. &lt;3",Bipolar

49674,So many nightmares. Does anyone else experience these in spurts? I’ve seen research that says it could be a manic episode coming on. I haven’t remembered my dreams in a while but i’ve had a bad one every night the past four days. They always happen right before I wake up.,Bipolar
49675,"How bad does it have to be to be considered psychosis? I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.However I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were retrospectively pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100% unquestioningly and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks (although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway) and then fought with all my family and friends about it.At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. (I really was sick though but the level of paranoia was weird).I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant; until recently I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.TLDR; at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs ""being paranoid and having weird thoughts""?I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff and I can't tell if for me it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first.

Did the underlying unease ever go away?Sorry if I said anything wrong i feel like there is still so much i dont know about bipolar. I had a great-aunt who was in and out of hospitals in her 20s for being bipolar but she was shunned from the family from being addicted to drugs and leaving her kids. Any time i try to ask about her/her bipolar diagnosis i get shut down. I am low-key afraid to google about it. So all i know really is from what my psychiatrist has told me which is a lot (with diagrams and everything). It was just a lot to take in.",Bipolar

I think every person with bipolar eventually will ask questions about what is part of their personality and what is the disease for lack of better word and I often think about the past and wonder ""was it that truly myself? how bad I felt how good when I was depressed when I felt awesome and thought I could have accomplished big things when I felt that I didnt fit anywhere and nothing was worthing pursuing... thelist goes onShare your thoughts with me people",Bipolar

Going so far as to say that mental illness is a choice. In regards to bipolar if you are not having negative consequences do you have bipolar? Because you can choose your actions and reactions and emotions and thoughts.That medicine is a crutch and is not necessary.He says that this gives you the power to control your life and swings and even get rid of swings.This came up when I was asking about tools because my regular tool for dealing with intrusive thoughts isn't really cutting it for me right now (having the thought then saying to myself is this thought beneficial/useful/helpful to me?)There are several things here that I am in complete disagreement with. Medicine is necessary thoughts and emotions are not controllable (i.e. they just happen but can potentially be directed) and mental illness is real and not a choice.Sure you can do things to help mitigate symptoms and try and improve yourself but ~~I am pretty sure~~ I will always have bipolar.

49741,"Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. Well my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right.

49764,"I’m new I’m very recently diagnosed (in conjunction w ASD). I’m just very scared of my head; I’m scared of the way my brain makes me think and I am scared of how little control I have over it. Ive no idea what world I’ve entered into mostly because I don’t understand much yet despite wanting to. I’ve studied psychology at university before dropping out (multiple times) and it’s so easy to look at things on the outside and understand them but to look introspectively is so difficult. It’s difficult to analyse the thoughts I should and shouldn’t listen to. It’s difficult to place or recognise moments of irritability excitement etc. Sometimes I’m panicking without even knowing I’m panicking or why. Im just very much in a state of barely knowing what’s going on in my head until the aftermath unless it’s depressive thoughts those are pretty easy to figure out and by far the most common for me. People near me just say I shouldn’t think that way but it’s hard explaining why I feel I have no control over how I genuinely feel… if that makes sense. Does it get better?

49765,"Switching meds planning pregnancy and moving across country. Recipe for disaster? For context I have type one and a history of 4 hospitalisations in 7 years. ECT (worked amazingly but only for a while) tried loads of medications and it seems like we've finally found a combo that works. I haven't had a serious episode for over two years now. I have a two year old son and despite the manic episode I had after four days is labour when he was born he's the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health. I love him to bits even though he was a surprise and I was totally sure I wasn't ready.Now my husband and I want a sibling for him. We both never had siblings of our own so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings. We want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger. 3 years difference is ok but 4 seems like much more to me. I don't know. I've started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in May. We also happen to be moving across the UK for my husband's work in July. If all goes well I could be pregnant by then.I told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant clomipramine is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects. He wants to switch me to an SSRI (citalopram) which I've tried several of and they haven't done much for me in the past. Clomipramine worked for me I think because it's also effective in OCD and while I don't have OCD my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. I've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode I had a year ago and since I haven't had any depression at all and I haven't gone manic either.I'm just worried with the move (even though I'm really looking forward to it) and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. As a mother I feel having a serious episode is not an option but then am I just putting more pressure on myself? Is this crazy? Should I try it or wait another year with the baby? Even just changing medication worries me but I can't consider pregnancy without doing that first.I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. Reassurance? Sanity check? Advice?

From what I remember (it’s been almost 2 years) it felt like my head was very empty and dark. My girlfriend said recently she was walking on eggshells around me back then and felt like I was going to lose it at any second. I even want to say I remember having these two internal dialogues conflicting each other all the time. I was really unhappy and felt suicidal continuously as well. After giving the med 4-6 weeks to work I got switched to Effexor. I did a little better with this one but still felt suicidal and empty. Fast forward 2 years and now I’m diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. I have been given a mood stabilizer that has done really well for me. The reason why I ask this is because I have this constant worry that I’m misdiagnosed for some reason. I believe I’m suffering from imposter syndrome.

During this period I broke up with my boyfriend (do not regret it) had a huge crush before breakup slept with the person I had a crush few days after breaking up felt really happy and energetic got involved in politics slept 5h a night (usually 8+h) got in an out of situationships went to parties told everybody how beautiful I am (usually I'm not happy with my body).

But again this person was very manipulative and was gaslighting me love bombing and getting mad for me moving out.

On all of these I've had regrets as well. I don't know what is my personality and what not. If I tell my psychiatrist that these actions were not normal to me then I probably get the diagnosis.

Grandiose thoughts hyper active brain (usually my brain is quiet and organised now it works so much I have a headache lol) etc you name it. Dreams of doing this and that eh. And I couldn’t even take a nap.All because... I wrote to my aunt I was never close with. Yes you read it right. You might ask yourself- „ee what?” I hasten to explain.So there was the year 2019 I went full-blown manic. It was really intense. My closest family was away but they knew something was up because of the things I had been telling them my online activity and overall behaviour reported by more distant family that lives nearby. (I visited them xx times per day.)So one time I really was scared I will die or something I opened the door to run to the family nearby and when I opened the door there was this aunt (she is not the one I visited she lives also nearby but more far away then the other family members)I was afraid to sleep (I didnt sleep properly in this time period only kind of blacked out) She tuckled me to sleep and I had some rest. When my closest family came back clearly distressed (the way the house looked + many other things) they called the ambulance and there I was in the mental hospital lol.

I kind of regretted not replying more to her even with a flower emoji and I randomly send her „happy (second) day of spring 🌷”And like that it kind of switched something in my brain lol.

I'm sure someone is going to comment and tell me to check myself into a facility for inpatient care. I cant fucking afford to. I have 100$ in my bank account and payday isnt for another week. I cant take any time off work because I will literally not make my mortgage payment. I'm sure some people really benefit from therapy and maybe at a later point in my recovery from this shit I'll be more open to it but right now all I can think is how the FUCK is talking to some stranger on the phone about my problems and them saying some stupid shit like ""oh i can hear how difficult this is for you try these excersizes the next time you feel like you're getting unmanageable"" going to fix anything. I want to be fucking medicated. I want to get to the point where I can act or feel like halfway of a part of a normal fucking human being and maybe then i can focus on miss linda's breathing therapy. I have been looking so forward to this appointment and I've been so proud of myself for even making it. I felt like I could get through the swings these past few weeks because I had this to look forward to and maybe just fucking maybe i'd get even an ounce of relief from this shit or be on the road to an ounce of relief; a means to an end. I felt like I was moving on from square one and on my way to progress and now I feel like I've fallen so much farther behind it. I'm going to have to find a different provider and wait another fucking six weeks through this shit. I cannot do this.",Bipolar

I am in the US.I'm in a job that often triggers me for various reasons. I've been in a almost constant depressive episode for the past almost two months. The exception is some hours of natural ease/happiness from spending time with a few nonjudgmental friends throughout that time. My work performance has tanked and it's becoming an issue. I have coworkers talking to my boss about it and I don't blame them but my boss is trying to be nice about it to a degree that makes me worry that I'm taking his reputation.I will be doing an out-patient treatment program in the next few weeks. I am already on intermittent FMLA but the current plan (which i do not like much) is to do part-time work in the afternoons at my current job while i do the program in the mornings.I just had an anxiety attack after getting a phonecall from my boss to talk about it.

I used references to get this job (I've been in it for just under a year) that were absolutely glowing from people I respect. Quitting is embarrassing for me and I wonder how much it will reflect on them. I don't feel comfortable using them as references any more.

I know i can be ""the problem"" but I always try to resolve any conflict and the older I've gotten the better I've gotten but I also am in a difficult place emotionally and am having a hard time focusing and functioning. I feel like I'm at the edge and yet there's a light at the end of the tunnel of treatment if i can just figure out how to do this job a little bit longer and find something else that can help me keep my home and continue my medications and therapy.Feels like a tall order.TL;DR: Assuming I don't have references how do I find a job as someone in their 30s?",Bipolar

I’ve been struggling a bit recently. 33F diagnosed bipolar (type unspecified) 4 years ago.I have a clear history of depression going back to high school that I don’t dispute. I was diagnosed ADHD as an elementary schooler and again in high school (good student but disruptive in class incessant talker impulse control issues highly unmotivated unless I’m interested in the subject object permanence issues that persist today) medicated for it on and off was prescribed a variety of medications and responded best to Adderall but I also have a touch of anxiety so dosing was finicky. Treating the ADHD diagnosis yielded some progress but never addressed all of my issues. I was medicated for depression at various times with similar results but notably* was never treated for both diagnoses at the same time. (Edited a typo.)Four years ago I was unmedicated and my depression was the worst it had ever been. I started seeing a new psychiatrist pried a bit into my family medical history (both ADHD and bipolar appear) and got a bipolar diagnosis. I’ve been on Trileptal and Wellbutrin since then and like before I feel a little better than I did before the meds but the issues aren’t addressed. My symptoms are mixed and I feel some degree of symptomatic (obviously good days and bad ones) every single day. My manic symptoms consistently spike in conjunction with anxiety flare ups which are always traceable to a trigger.My sister (28F) is diagnosed with depression and ADHD and when she describes how the combination affects her it matches up to my constant mixed symptoms to a T. I’ve started to wonder if I haven’t been going at my mental health the wrong way and I’m extremely anxious about bringing it up to my doctor for fear of sounding manic. I don’t think that I’m healed or no longer in need of meds and I don’t plan on taking myself off of them. I also don’t plan on asking for stimulants; I’m open to any treatment plan deemed a fit. But I have a lot of concern that I won’t be taken seriously.Has anyone been through anything like this? To be clear I’m not asking for commentary on a diagnosis! Just seeking advice for broaching this subject with my doctor. Part of me wonders if I might be best off trying to connect with a new one; I’ve raised concerns about my meds not being effective numerous times in the past and haven’t really felt heard.

49837,"I think I was misdiagnosed Okay so 2 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and at the time I was like ""this doesn't sound right but I guess I'll go with it."" I was put on lamotrigene after a 20 minute appointment with my psychiatrist where with some vague descriptions of what my highs and lows were he decided it was a solid diagnosis. But the thing is he never asked for specifics about what they were like just generally if I experienced them.The highs of my 'mania' would last about 1-3 months at a time and usually consisted of me being very active and upbeat but I never exactly had any risky behaviors associated with it. I've never had periods of hypersexuality or completely upended my life on a whim or anything extreme like that. I can get irritable and my impulse control has never been great but I've never felt like my thoughts were racing or anything like that. Probably the most 'extreme' thing I've ever done was to move to a different state after a 5 year relationship that I felt trapped in ended. I just needed a fresh start from it and I got that before moving back home with a better perspective (albeit in the middle of a depressive episode).In fact the only really concerning thing I ever had going on were intense periods of depression (also lasting between 1 and 3 months at a time). I would have a hard time getting myself motivated to do basic tasks and my interest in things I enjoyed waned during those times to pretty much nothing. Being put on meds I was just coming out of a long funk and after starting lamotrigene it never really felt like that funk ended. I still have problems motivating myself to do basic things even 2 years in and I constantly feel like I'm lagging and forcing myself to do everything and I hate it. During my up periods I used to actually workout and be active and would write and take my son to the park and be an active and eager participant in family activities. But since being medicated I don't have any of that. I'm gaining weight and have zero motivation to do anything about it despite being miserable because of it being an active parent feels like a chore and I can't write to save my life. I feel like I'm a totally different person and I don't want to be this way anymore. I think I might have been misdiagnosed but idk how to broach this with my psychiatrist (I feel like he barely listens to me). If anything my symptoms are much closer to that of ADHD or MDD just applying my lived experiences to them but when I tried to bring up ADHD he kind of handwaved it away saying that adult ADHD was difficult to diagnose and left it there. I'm not sure how to bring this up with him and was hoping some people here might be able to give me some tips on how to do that? Should I get a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist?

I hate it here idk what triggered it. Is it possible that realllly good news could have triggered it?

My ex has been trying to take care of me because I would just ball for no reason and I was trying to figure out why like i couldnt be alone or else i would start crying from anxiety and then on sunday I was so depressed I was staring off into space and wouldnt move or talk so my ex had to help me out of bed.Yesterday I had sugar and was like hm this is a suspisuous amount of energy. Then today after I got a good critique from my proffesor I got filled with energy then I ate food and drank water and now I have even more because when Im manic and I eat or drink water it makes the mania worse.

I was diagnosed at 18 and I stayed medicated until I was 22. However when I was 22 I ended up homeless due to a conflict with my mother. I was having trouble getting my medication at the time so I eventually talked to my doctor about weaning myself off my medication. He agreed that I was handling my symptoms very well and that we could give it a shot. All was very well for the next unmedicated 3.5 years.However just this year I've been going through some noticeable changes. Starting about 6 months ago I settled into hypomania and dealt with it rather well. However that hypomania for the first time ever developed into mania. I am currently enjoying the worst depressive episode I have ever had in my life - but I'm thinking it's a mixed episode because I am also irritable and experiencing impulse control issues. I've heard that bipolar can become more intense as you age but I really didn't see this coming. I thought I was one of ""the lucky ones"" whose symptoms weren't severe enough to necessitate treatment and that I could use all the tools I learned in my many years of inpatient and outpatient therapy to stay on track. I do have an intake appointment for a local psychiatric care group lined up but for the first time my symptoms are so bad that I'm having trouble working and doing day-to-day tasks. I have also noticed a lapse in memory which really scares me. I can't bear to be around people because I don't want them to see me like this.

I've been diagnosed with BPD2 and am a self identifies sex addict (and video games but let's stop that list here:⁠-⁠P) [btw I have joined the SA 12-step program and sought other outlets which are all well and good I'm just seeking validation] I've been on Lamictal and Wellbutrin for a couple years now and they've been a part of my daily routine through some seriously hard times some could argue I wouldn't be here today without them as part of my treatment. Another consistent factor is my primary coping mechanism... since I was like 13 I've had a daily routine a nightly ritual if you will of masturbation and more often than not some form of pornography. It dawned on me that I might be dependent on this behavior as it's a function that I literally have a handle of and gives me the otherwise nonexistent sense of predictability/reliability in my neurochemistry. Nothing beats the surge of endorphins to detach from my woes at the end of the day followed by the subsequent oh-so-sweet fatigue and ability to sleep.Now I don't have the capacity to get into the weeds here yet but it's causing me issues even in a peak state of stability in my life. I want to know if other neurodivergents are experiencing similar sexual habits and their perspective both on themselves (yourselves) and on the behavior. I'm oversleeping after late nights on screen struggling to find peace in my love life and craving the same power &amp; control I feel when I get my porn and orgasm. I have had periods of time where I stayed limited: turning of screens before bed being open with partners about my porn usage. What I notice still is I crave the release my body demands it or will refuse to sleep. I'm always half a thought away from overspending on sex toys or obsessively looking for ways to have sex.I find myself over sexualizing things and ending up at a point of...well guess I'll just masturbate and coast on that feeling.

But I've seen a couple of comments on the sub in the past few days that stigmatize other illnesses (schizophrenia and personality disorders specifically) and I just felt like I had to say something.As a community of people with a profoundly stigmatized illness we should know better and we should absolutely not be adding to anybody else's burden with misinfo or stigmatizing language. A lot of us have various comorbidities and a lot of us have schizoaffective! They deserve this space to be safe and welcoming too.

I've been to 9 different doctors for different opinions. 7 therapists just to find one I was comfortable with. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FUCKING MEDICATION. I've tried Zoloft Abilify Lamictal Zyprexa Lexapro Strattera Prozac Seroquel Risperdal Xanax Klonopin and Ativan. Not to even mention the ""natural"" supplements I tried out of pure desperation. IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.The only combination that ""worked"" for me was the olanzapine/fluoxetine combo with Lamictal as a mood stabilizer. That combination bought me a month of euthymia A FUCKING MONTH before it started to go to shit again. My mood started to decline for NO FUCKING REASON. My life was going perfectly BUT FOR SOME FUCKING REASON MY MOOD STARTED TO DECLINE. I decided to go off Lamictal because of the brain fog and because it wasn't helping at that point. Eventually I went off of olanzapine because of the fatigue. Replaced it with quetiapine but that didn't do shit. Got hospitalized because my depression was getting out of control I went out with hope for the first time. I got discharged on January 28th wasn't really doing well but I was hopeful by February 8th all that hope AND MORE was crushed. Attempted suicide and spent another 3 days at the hospital but refused to get admitted to the ward again because they were completely fucking useless. Couple of weeks later had a mixed episode because quetiapine wasn't working for me like olanzapine was. My life was completely beyond repair after the episode completely over. Just completely over no way it was ever getting better after that. Went back to olanzapine and here I am.As I said my life is over. This illness has defeated me. It's been a month and it hasn't gotten any bit better. My mood chart looks like a flat line I haven't had a single mood that wasn't awful in the past month and a half. No one cares people don't care that they've hurt me. Everyone has moved on but I'm here. I don't know why I'm here like I said it's over. I cry myself to sleep whenever I can. I avoid almost everyone except for a few close friends who don't even know what I'm going through. I don't want to tell them because it just ruins everything. I believe all people are inherently assholes its in our nature to be selfish. I deserve to suffer like this not because Im me but just because im human. Every human deserves this and more. Even if I were to get better I would still be awful.

I’m always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isn’t even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently it’s been getting worse as I’ve had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode my mania was only feeling really confident or believing I had superpowers or paranoia that everyone was looking at me and my irritation was really bad.

However I had a pretty bad episode a couple of weeks ago and hurt myself and did some stupid stuff. Anyway now I am waiting to be admitted into a PHP but there is a 4 week waiting list so I am just kinda floating by as I wait. I am a stay at home Dad (I am on disability) and I feel so awful because I just kinda sit here while my 1 and a half year old runs around and I put on Ms. Rachel (if you are a parent you may know who that is) and just let him do his own thing. I love my son with every ounce of my being he is my whole world. He and my wife keep me going keep me alive. But I just feel like I am so inadequate as a dad. I barely have the motivation or energy to fully interact with him and be the father I really want to be. Don't get me wrong I don't neglect him I make sure he's healthy and safe I keep my eyes on him and when he acknowledges me I give him hugs and snuggles and kisses and he just fills my heart with joy. But I feel like I could be doing so much more to better his life I should be sitting with him and teaching him how to speak teaching him right from wrong but instead I sit here on my computer listening to music and watch him run around and play with his toys because its the only thing that keeps me level and the only thing I have the mental capacity to do to get through the day before my wife gets home from work. I have no regrets being a parent even with this disorder I just hate myself for not being more involved in his development. I know he loves me he always runs up to me saying Dada Dada and smiles and laughs and is such a happy little dude I just hope this program I am going to be doing will help me figure out how to regulate my emotions better so I can be more interactive and give him the best childhood he can possibly have. I want to build forts with him and run around outside and use our imaginations and go on pretend adventures. I just wish I could have the mental power to do these things and feel like a better father. And with my wife I feel like I am always dragging drama into her life. She constantly has to worry about me hide all the knives in the house she has to remind me how to be a human make me shower remind me to eat remind me to take my meds remind me to do things around the house etc. she is incredible and such a trooper and my savior but she deserves so much better.

I’ve recently gotten my diagnosis and the psychiatrist believed that the last hypomanic episode seemed like it was bordering mania and I’ve yet to disclose some of the following to her yet out of fear. When I was depressed about 19/20 years old I experienced some odd things that I brushed off for years believing I was “just depressed” and it was normal for depression. I felt consumed by this dark cloud entity in which I believed was the soul of Hitler haunting me. I believed he was going to possess me and take over or that he saw the same darkness within me and wanted to rule through me. I also heard my name once when no one was around and dark male voice rambling words I could not decipher. He was speaking but I couldn’t understand words only the noise of the voice. Then in 2021/2022 I experienced an episode that now we think was mania and not hypomania. I’d had a spiritual awakening and believed I had ascended to a new dimension I would preach spirituality whilst simultaneously gatekeeping what I thought was the ultimate knowledge. I would try to link everything philosophically. I’d felt I tapped into the powers of my ancestors and was magical and was better than everyone else. I was seeing shadow people feeling entities again experiencing paranormal activity. I believed in so many wild theories about the universe and that I was getting messages through animals angel numbers etc. of course the mania continued with thousands of dollars spent on rocks completely changing my house decor wardrobe etc to match. Using divination tarot witchcraft etc. The 2021/2022 time confuses me because spirituality became a trend and more widely accepted but my experiences still feel really “off”.

He read the list to me and I immediately started crying. It was so much. It all came back to me and I remembered how miserable it made me. 15mg olanzapine 1200mg lithium forgot how much effexor along with anafranil. I was in such a terrible place for a year constantly trying to work around those meds and getting unstable anytime I tried to get off of one. I couldn't feel pleasure I was tired all the time lost interest in all my hobbies and in life felt stupid and dumb and numb lost my libido was emotionally flatlined (my fucking grandfather died while I was on these and I felt nothing) and I felt so hopeless.

Weren't the meds supposed to make me feel better? I remember initially the previous doctor from the outpatient suggested maybe lowering the dose or switching to a different AP but I declined and I regret that so much.

Hello guys I’m 26f and lately been put on seroquel 300mg and tedema due to being in a depressive episode (the worst of my entire life) I’m bipolar type 2 but my hypomanic episodes don’t compare to the depressive ones as they are minor in comparasion. Being on seroquel for the last few months I feel like I got really ""lazy"" I just move between my bed and coach and rarely leave the house. I really need help in that area.My libido is non existant I feel like that area of my life is lost or something and it bothers me as well. I sleep a solid 12h a day if not more it’s also bugging me because I’m never awake before midday and I feel like life is passing me by. The weight gain is another issue needless to say.So these are the things that I need help with I wish I could drop seroquel altogether but my psychiatrist says that it’s currently the best treatment for me. Any input is welcomed thank you.",Bipolar
49923,"Yesterday was the one-year anniversary of my last suicide attempt. TL;DR: I'm in a much better place and decided to make it a day of celebration instead of a sad anniversary.Here's a lengthy post I wrote on my socials in regard to my attempt up to now and other sentiments.Today is the one-year anniversary of my last suicide attempt. It was traumatic enough the first time but nothing compared to the second time. I had a quicker and easier recovery after the first attempt but I was completely broken on this day last year. But I’m happy to report that since that day I am (mostly) whole again. I say mostly because there are still things I’m working on and I still deal with symptoms of PTSD from it and there are things I’m still heartbroken about but I’m still here and continuing to improve.I’ve made a lot of strides and changes since then. One of the biggest and most important changes I made was choosing to leave my psychiatrist and therapist both of whom I had been seeing for 10 years. It wasn’t an easy decision and in some ways it was just as frightening as the state of mind I had been in. Up to that point they were the only mental health professionals I had ever worked with aside from one counselor I briefly saw at the college I attended. It was hard enough to find doctors I was comfortable with the first time and to find someone else after 10 years felt like leaving a part of myself behind. Obviously their treatment wasn’t working for me any longer and in fact was only worsening the condition I was in so the change was imperative. It is easily one of the best decisions I have ever made and I would make that decision again a trillion times over. The psychiatrist and therapists I have now are phenomenal I couldn’t be happier to have them and I am eternally grateful to have them. All three of them were recommended to me by the wonderful therapist I had during my IOP who I am also eternally grateful to have had. If you feel your doctors aren’t helping don’t wait to find ones that will.When I posted about my hospitalization and IOP last year I mentioned how my fellow patients and group members were just as instrumental in my recovery as my mental health care professionals and my family/friends and that is still true now. I have been in a DBT group since last June and each group member (past and present) has helped me heal as much as anyone whether they’re aware of it or not (of course I try to tell them that). By the way DBT is awesome and there are so many aspects of it that everyone could benefit from mentally ill or not.Over the past year I’ve strengthened parts of me that needed work. I changed things and reframed ways of thinking that were detrimental. I discovered new parts of myself. I broke down the walls I had built. I strengthened the parts of me that needed work. I’ve established boundaries and have stuck to them. I’ve opened up more. I now allow myself to feel my emotions instead of fighting them or bottling them up. I have stopped putting myself last. Most importantly I have found myself again.Of course I didn’t do any of this alone. I’ve been lucky enough to have a ton of support. I have great bosses and a work family that supported me from when my struggles started when I was going through recovery my time away from work who welcomed me back with open arms when I returned to work and who still support me daily. I already mentioned the support from my fellow patients and group members who I will never forget. The health professionals both when I was inpatient and during my IOP. My amazing therapists and psychiatrist. My friends who I’d die for whether I see them frequently or not. I’ve been blessed with wonderful family members wonderful in-laws my brothers who I love amazing parents and of course an angel of a wife. I owe them everything and I owe them everything. I also owe myself for allowing them to help me and for working my ass off to heal and improve.If you’re still here after the struggles you’ve endured you owe yourself too.Instead of letting this be a sad anniversary I’ve decided to look at it positively and celebrate it. I will celebrate the small wins as much as the big wins. I will celebrate the positive changes and progress I’ve made. Instead of mourning what I left behind and who I was I will celebrate what I’ve gained and who I’ve become. Instead of mourning the past I will celebrate the present and the future. Most importantly I will celebrate that I am still here.If you’re struggling don't struggle alone. You are not alone and you will be surprised how many people want to help you. Keep fighting and be proud of yourself for still being here today. I’m happy you’re still here.",Bipolar
49924,"Voluntary or Involuntary Admission? I have read quite a few posts that talked about how their doctor told them that they might be admitted as involuntary if they didn't go in voluntarily. But didn't they just change it to Involuntary once you were at the hospital? Whenever I have gone to the ER willingly the moment the ER doctor interviews me I immediately get formed.

49933,"Manic only when on SSRIs I am 37F. I have had two severe psychotic manic episodes in the last two years. Both times I was on Zoloft.For the first one in summer 2021 the pharmacy messed up my Zoloft dose and I was taking 1.5 times as much as I should’ve been. It was a euphoric mania and it occurred during a period of extreme stress from a divorce as well. I also started taking a 5-htp supplement around the time of my episode. I was hospitalized. I was also on lamotrigine at the time. I gained a ton of weight from both the antipsychotics and lithium. I went off antipsychotic first seroquel that caused me to gain around a pound every single day. Lithium I stayed on longer but I gained around 5 pounds a month. I then fell into a severe depression. Like unbelievably severe. I thought I had had severe depressive episodes before but I was wrong. I was not functional and planning my suicide. My psychiatrist initially refused to prescribe an SSRI or put me on vyvanse what I used to take for adhd and also helped with depression. I eventually talked him into it I can’t remember exactly how. I was also on lamotragine I think I would’ve died if I had not been out on Zoloft at that time. But it was a lower dose. Fast forward during a time of work stress maybe 6 months later I slipped into a more agitated mania. I was also on lamotrigine. I was again hospitalized stopped taking Zoloft and vyvanse and went on Zyprexa and lithium. Weight gain with Zyprexa was still significant but leveled out relatively quickly and lithium doesn’t seem to be an issue this time.After writing a book I guess my main question is- does anybody here only go manic on SSRIs? In the past the one other time I was on one it caused rapid mood cycling and so did Zoloft until I was on lamotrigine. I’ve been labeled as bipolar I which I initially talked him out of and he changed it to not otherwise specified until I had my second one. I’ve been told the average age for first mania for a woman is 31 and I was 35. But I don’t think it was a coincidence they were both on Zoloft. I am pretty convinced I won’t go manic without Zoloft or another SSRI. But I can’t afford to take the risk. Which means I’m stuck on meds I may not need for basically forever.

So I'm 17 (got diagnosed on my birthday quick fun fact I guess lol) and moved out of my parent's into an entirely different state back in January. I was doing completely fine and actually felt on top of the world for awhile. I did some exams that allowed me to graduate early before moving told myself and everyone I'll get a new job and start college as soon as I can. I haven't been able to get a job here yet so I have been doing commissions to hold me off for a while. I was doing really good with that making about $80-200 a week which held me off pretty well (I'm living with my boyfriend who lives with his mom so I don't have to pay rent or anything just need to buy stuff for myself and my cat) everything was going good. I had to stop my meds after I moved because my psychiatrist isn't licensed in this state plus the side effects for the meds I was currently on gave me really bad tardive dyskinesia. My boyfriend's mom has been pressuring me more and more recently to get a job sending me links for places to apply to more and I've been applying to them. The other night I had a conversation with my parents (I'm still on good terms with them) and my mom noticed I must be manic because I told her I've been unable to get much sleep at all due to my mind constantly racing. She said she wants me to come visit home asap because she has bipolar too and based on her experience she doesn't want me being unmedicated and manic in an entirely different state especially when the depression comes. I told my boyfriend's mom this and she was really disappointed saying that she doesn't want me to constantly visit back and forth again (before I moved I would visit for a couple weeks very often) and that I'm supposed to have a job by now and that basically if I'm going to be doing this I should just move back until Im 18. I seriously don't want to move back though. I love my parents and everything and I want to just visit not move back entirely. I'm happier here with my boyfriend finally have myself settled and comfortable here and I'm worried if I move back I'll get addicted to bad habits again because my mental health was a lot worse there. My parents and my boyfriend's mom had a whole dispute and I was in the middle of it and since then I just feel like it triggered something in me and now I feel miserable and sick and scared. I'm sleeping constantly and when I wake up I have messages from my boyfriend's mom telling me to apply to some place along with messages from my parents asking when I'll be visiting. I don't want to disappoint or upset either of them with what I do and I don't know what'll be best for me staying here and getting a job or risking it and going back to get my mental health worked on. I haven't been able to draw much at all since then and I fell behind on my commissions which is making me feel worse and I just don't know what to do right now. I feel stuck and I just want to cry and sleep and ignore all these issues. I haven't felt this shitty in so long I can't bring myself to do anything and I keep suddenly crying several times a day when I'm awake.Sorry if this issue seems trivial or anything. I just have an extreme fear of disappointing people which makes this all so much worse for me. I really want to visit my parents and get on something that'll help me but I'm worried that if I go my boyfriend's mom won't allow me to come back and I don't want to upset her with my decision since she keeps telling me to apply to the places she's sending me and I'm telling her I will so she won't get upset.I don't know what I want from this post.

However I am pretty sure if it was the other way around I would be much more interested and comfortable with communicating and comforting her. Im sure its hard for her to not take things personally and being bipolar isn’t an excuse for abuse. I do not and never have abused her ever whether physically or emotionally.

I'm very communicative to people about my disorder and what happens even when I'm medicated. Despite this people were not very understanding with me. And while I understand people don't have to put up with my mental illness I still feel as if I was given no compassion at all. Some people did and im grateful to them but its so hard and it makes me so anxious. A lot of us have to switch medications multiple times in our life and I really wish people would be more understanding to those who are bipolar.

49952,"Wanting to be Normal It’s been a weird year. The world became a hotbed of viral death and I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I mean apparently I just couldn’t let the pandemic upstage me.I’ve tried to deny who I am for the past 10 years. If you had to label me I often am described as an extreme extrovert. All my friends tell me they “don’t know how I do it.” I stay out until 2am go to bed at 3am and wake up for work at 6am multiple days in a row without a problem. I do it all seamlessly making it look effortless. I’ve never missed a day of work because I was tired or hungover which is why I can’t stop acting the way I do. I don’t know how to say no. The word is literally not in my vocabulary. My lust to wander be around friends and experience everything the world has to offer is insatiable but in an unhealthy way. I used to think that everyone else I knew was lame. I would come up with excuses for them; “they didn’t go to a party college they’re married they don’t like techno music.” But ultimately I would get mad that my friends couldn’t handle social interactions the same way I did. Turns out everyone I know is just normal and I am bipolar.Throughout undergrad and graduate school I normalized my actions as part of the college experience. I still did well in school while partying and sleeping around so why worry? Promiscuity and drinking is part of college culture so what if I was a bit extra every now and then?Recently though my disease has gotten the best of me. The thoughts in my head won’t go away. I sit there in turmoil knowing that I am being unreasonable but I am plagued by insecurity fear of missing out irritability anxiety and no matter how I try to reason through them they disrupt my life. There is such a stigma on not only bipolar disorder but mental disorders in general that it has made me afraid to try medication. Why can’t I be the way I used to be without medication? Why can’t I feel like myself without taking an antipsychotic? I know we all need a little extra help sometime but I am scared. I am scared to admit who I really am.",Bipolar

I got this deep seated feeling that either someone broke in and put it there or more likely there is some sort of supernatural shit going on and I’m being haunted. I know rationally that this isn’t true. But I still feel anxiety in my gut that I’m being haunted and bad shit is going to happen. This is a pattern I tend to get really emotional about some conspiracy or something supernatural.

I wish with all of my might that I could be someone’s rock even though I can’t be one for myself.The lack of hope that one day it will get better and I will be strong enough to conquer this. The feelings of anger and irritation pulsing through my body for no apparent reason. My aggression toward everyone even though I know they have done nothing wrong. The grief I feel when the thoughts come rushing in telling me I am a burden to others and everyone who once loved me.The heartache from the thought that I am pushing everyone away and will soon be alone. The fear of facing this alone.The exhaustion of putting up a front to mask my many emotions and terrifying thoughts just to seem OK and “normal.”It’s more than just being happy one day and sad the next. There are highs of being productive with little amounts of sleep that can go on for days even weeks.The manic state of rash decisions and risky behavior such as impromptu tattoos or even solo backpacking trips through Europe. The euphoric feeling of being on top of the world.

I was initially diagnosed Bipolar 2 and tried a number of medications that either didn’t work or made me worse.The bad experience with medication caused me to “take a break” from medication off and on. Around the age of 25 I was hospitalized for a manic episode. A year later when I was 26 I was hospitalized again for another manic episode.Finally around the age of 27 I started seeing a new psychiatrist and she put me on Abilify and to my surprise I finally felt stable happy and “normal”.Over the years I have had to adjust my Abilify every now and again but can usually get stable fairly quickly.Until now. I began having hypomanic symptoms about a week ago so we raised my Abilify to 30MGS and added 5MGS of Zyprexa.Maybe I’m being impatient it’s only been two days but I’m still having hypomanic symptoms. And on top of that I’m having balance and coordination issues.My fear is that the Abilify is no longer working and I am accepting the possibility that I may have to start from square one.Which means medication trial and error and with my past bad experiences with medication I may be completely dysfunctional for God knows how long.Which leads me to considering possibly going on Disability. I know it’s not easy to get and could take up to a year to receive benefits which is a concern.I also feel going on Disability may lower my self esteem. To be clear I don’t judge others that are on it who really need it.

I typically take my meds at 8pm every night and right before bed. I’m very good at taking my meds on time I really don’t miss them so I just want to be safe when it comes to being in a different time zone. Do I take them at the same in the other country or do I take them at the same time I would while there? And any tips from you guys about traveling. I’m a bit nervous to step out of my really good routine and sleep schedule and be traveling to multiple countries.

49999,Does anyone feel kinda confused or feel like they can’t trust their own brain all the time? I feel like the world is more complex than simple and everything just seems so confusing and all over the place. I’m still trying to get stable with right medicines.

50000,"Just been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and Abilify has been a real pain… I’ve just been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and it was kinda like everything was closing in on me but it also made so much sense. My next appointment for my psychiatrist isn’t for another 3 weeks (she’s also very booked out) but I will be talking to her about what I’m saying here :) My psych started me on 10mg of Abilify. I started taking it and felt so jittery and just down right awful. I couldn’t stand up in the shower I couldn’t do my makeup or get dressed. I also didn’t feel like it would be safe for me to drive. It was hell. I took 10mg for 5 days. I went to the chemist that we see very regularly to pick up our prescriptions and she said I am experiencing akathisia. Her advice was to write it down and see if it gets any worse and if it did to email my psychiatrist or get into contact with her some way. I kind of took it my own way and just started taking half of the pills and guess what? Akathisia is only half as bad now. I’ve been taking the half tablets for maybe 5 days? So 9 days on Abilify so far. It’s still horrible but I’d never want to feel that way again. It was so bad. I know Abilify is not the right medication for me. The benefits for me are : less racing thoughts more stable mood. The disadvantages of Abilify for me are: not helping sleep at all (this has been a huge issue for years) feeling kinda “weird” and not myself around my friends etc. losing interest in a lot of creative things I used to love. And of course the akathisia. I am scared of a few “bipolar meds” because I’m scared of gaining weight now that I am at a healthy weight. Just thought I’d add that in there. This is kind of a vent and I know finding the perfect or best combination of medication isn’t easy and takes time but I’d love to hear everyone’s experiences with different medications :)",Bipolar

50003,"Unmedicated going on a year now recently married and losing my fucking mind. EDIT: Thanks again for all of the advice. I know that my husband just doesn’t understand and needs to educate himself more on this illness. A little backstory on me- I grew up with a bipolar-schizoaffective mother who really was out of control. No stability. Ever. She ended up killing herself when I was 16. I was first medicated and diagnosed at 13 and always felt my mother almost pushed me into a diagnosis. I was medicated until she died. Then not again until 2019 at 25 years old in the midst of a terribly toxic relationship. This man lied to me about everything forced me to go get medicated only to use it against me and gaslight me into thinking I was crazy. I found a good med combo and met my husband in 2020. I was still emotionally shattered from previous relationship. But my husband stuck by me. When I say he pushed me- I don’t mean he made me or asked me. He did make comments and suggestions. I think he is just afraid the meds are going to damage me more in other ways idk. Since being off meds I’ve held down a great job but I’ve never had an issue working anyways. I think because I’m not like my mother was to the same extent I think I can do it without the meds. But lately I feel like I can’t. My work is suffering now bc I can’t focus. My relationship is suffering because I can’t open up and be vulnerable anymore. Just feels like a spiral and I don’t like that. I’ve always prided myself for my resilience but it’s come with a lot of suffering self hatred and pain. So yeah. Thank you all again.————-When my husband and I first got together I was medicated and mostly stable. He is very natural and pushed me to try life without meds so I did. And for the most part- I’m doing okay but I struggle occasionally. Especially lately due to family issues and work. I am the agitated type when manic and everything annoys me. I’m also very sensitive so any criticism really pushes me. Anyways- I have a had a few drinks and when I drink all my stifled emotions bubble to the surface. And my husband is a very logical type a person. He doesn’t get it and I don’t know that he really wants to. I have really suppressed a huge part of who I am in order to stay “normal” but I feel like I can’t do it much longer. How can I let my guard down with my husband and let him know who I really am deep down? I know he loves me but we are two totally different ppl who have lived very different lives. I feel like a big part of me is missing since I’ve been holding all of my darkness in… I’m ok with my darkness and I need to feel those things but it’s been so long that I forgot how to deal with it. I kind of have been considering getting back on meds but I’m afraid to tell him. Please give me any advice you may have. Thank you.",Bipolar
50004,Got diagnosed and am now spiraling So I found out I was bipolar by looking it up because it popped in my head one day and ADHD didn't explain everything. So I did that realized it matched perfectly talked to my psych and it turned out he already thought I had a mood disorder but didn't know which one. I had never brought up the manic feelings I got where I'd just be really confident and happy for no reason kind of like not giving a shit about what anyone thought and then having a million ideas thinking how I'm gonna improve my life also wasting a ton of money on games because in those moments my mind just goes do it who cares. I never told him about these feelings because I thought it was normal. I've always thought how I felt emotions was completely normal because I thought everyone had no control over them and because it was normal for me I had never known any difference. I know for a fact that I'm bipolar and I'm diagnosed but it still feels like pepple think I'm lying for no reason or like no one believes me. I'm not lying about how I feel and my symptoms but it feels like everyone thinks I am because what they say is how did no one find out about it until now. I never talked about it because I thought it was normal. I only started talking about it when I said I feel like only sometimes I'm lucid and other times I have no control over how I feel. Like it feels like I only swim to the surface once in a while and then I'm dragged back under into depression and mania rapidly cycling between the two. It feels like after my diagnosis I started cycling more and more rapidly? Like I've kind of lost any semblance of control I had left I guess. Like I feel manic when I'm depressed or vice versa. It's scary because it feels like I'm having more frequent mood swings like 3-4 times daily. I don't know if they're actually more frequent or I'm just realizing that I'm having mood swings because I never recognized them before. I don't even know why I'm posting this I guess it's a cry for help? Idk I know that I'm manic right now and I'll probably think what the fuck later but it feels like what I should do right now. I'm so scared I feel so out of control. I had to take a leave of absence from college. I don't know what to do anymore I feel like I'm just at the whims of my emotions and I hate it. I'm so scared.

Does anyone else struggle to tell the difference between what’s “normal” behavior and what’s manic behavior? For example I’m in a relationship with a wonderful man and out of the blue last week I just decide I don’t want to be with him anymore and lose all feelings for him. And all of these reasons to leave that I keep telling myself sound completely valid but how can I go from loving him and wanting to marry him to just complete indifference? When I get like this I turn cold towards him and want nothing to do with him. I feel annoyed when he tries to talk to me. Is that normal?

I had a pretty bad alcohol issue prior to January. I realized I went into mixed episodes when I mixed lithium and wine. So I switched to Whiteclaw and had no issues and now I just have not been drinking much. Like an idiot I was feeling relaxed the other night and thought it would be nice to have some wine to further calm down. Just had a glass. Last night I drank the rest and started getting super hopeless.My issues with bipolar lead to my husband telling me he wanted a divorce 2 months ago. I was struggling a lot in the second half of 2022. I was weaned off Lexapro after taking it for 8 years. Historically i do not do well in periods of adjusting meds. I was getting better by early January as I stopped drinking wine. But then the divorce happened (not officially but no chance of reconciliation).My kids (13 and 15) knew he wanted a divorce before I did. They thought it was a good idea because of all of the fighting. My 13 year old still spends time with me but my 15 year old doesn’t even like being around me.

50023,"On suicide The past few months I've been struggling with persistent suicide ideation and even attempted during a major depressive episode. But instead of saying ""it's just a symptom of your disease"" I would like to walk you through my thought process. The argument from circumstance. Right now I am unemployed with no realistic chance of getting a job. My resume is spotty and the market I operated in pretty much collapsed. My memory focus and cognitive skills are pretty much gone after having two psychoses in a year. A low skilled job almost always requires a drivers license which I'm not capable of (I tried). Furthermore I have a criminal record from the things I did during my psychosis excluding me from most jobs in my field anyways. I'm lonely and have no support system (no friends or family that can offer any stability). Meaning that within a year or so I'll be forced to sell my house and eventually live on the streets. Homelessness is not a reason for suicide of course nor is unemployment but it's also something I'd rather not do. Yet it is almost unavoidable. The argument from harm. My actions whether in psychosis depression mania anger or just because who I am have caused irreparable emotional and material damage. My continued existence is a danger to society and will always incur tremendous cost (through health care living on the streets and I've had multiple encounters with the police during both manic and depressive episodes). While one could argue that all life is ultimately detrimental in my case it's fairly obvious: I cause harm without being able to effectively control it and I do not wish to cause any more harm. The self image of a calm collected person is a fever dream in reality I'm just a unstable criminally psychotic mental health patient. The argument from hopelessness. You might argue ""well maybe you'll find a job some friends maybe even love and what you did in the past might not happen again"". Living on the streets is an adventure! Unfortunately it might also not be the case. I've always had a pessimistic and depressed outlook and whether that is caused by brain abnormalities or not almost seems irrelevant: life has always been a struggle and I do not want to continue this struggle. It's hopeless really I just kinda fumbled my way into an impossible situation. The argument from despair. Although perhaps a majority of people disagrees with the following: I believe society is on the brink of collapse and within our projected lifetimes things will likely only get worse. Without going into the precise reasons for believing this I feel like it's almost uncontroversial to say ""things are bad and they'll get worse"". For the longest time I held a certain morbid curiosity for this ""lets see how this plays out"" but after my depressive psychosis (which was a traumatizing hell) I quite simply no longer have the desire to see it. The argument from meaning. Commonly the argument against suicide goes ""what about the people you leave behind"". The two people I still have in my life pretty much said ""we get it just make sure your affairs are in order"". So that's not a real argument for me personally. But in the abstract you might say ""you owe it to the world to do your best"" to which my mind always replies ""no"". I have nothing to contribute anyways but if life is simply reduced to doing the meaningless bidding of others in order to perpetuate some bizarre notion of ""you must work to live even if life is miserable"" then I simply refuse to play that game. But even if it is not miserable which it will be (because my brain is broken) is life then simply some egocentric hedonism ""find pleasure in something"". I mean that's also a little bit of a hollow existence. Someone once said to me ""life just *is*"" there is no purpose or meaning to it which is fair. But then not living really seems like a choice and I can choose to stop it. The argument from personality. Nobody likes a pseudo-intellectual climate activist with anti-capitalist tendencies that has a mental health disorder and will probably live on the streets. Especially not one that studied AI and philosophy. Especially not ... you can fill in all the stereotypes feel free to pick the ones you hate the most. Now you might say ""just shut up then and be normal"" I quite literally can't. You can't just say ""change your personality"". I have seen so many death threats on social media it's worrying in its own right. So that's it that's the thought process. I'm just too tired I have lived an acceptable life. I've known riches and wealth love and the depths of thought. But it's done. Life will always end there is even some beauty in the idea that I get to pick when.",Bipolar

I'm taking medication that I'm excited about I feel really happy that my psychiatrist and therapist both think this diagnosis is 100% accurate.I just also feel so lost - like a part of me has been identified that has been ignored for so long.

50025,"starting abilify plus some venting I've been on wellbutrin for around 5 years lamictal for three and now am adding abilify. Wellbutrin stopped by zoloft-induced dissociative fugues and Lamictal changed my life tbh. I started taking it at around the same time as the first COVID lock downs and the medication plus the chance to recognize (and indulge) my agoraphobia was huge. I used to have panic attacks and dissociative episodes every single time I tried going to grocery stores restaurants malls or anywhere else crowded and overstimulating and that's much less of an issue now. Three years later everything is still better but I have a really hard time with task initiation/completion and do still have hypomanic episodes scary intrusive thoughts and constant suicidal ideation (that sometimes gets a little too active for comfort). I kinda thought I was doing fine since it really is noticeably better than before but during a recent appointment with my psychiatrist I was mentioning this and he asked if it was affecting my ability to work. I said no but then almost immediately remembered how frequently I spend an entire day staring at my screen unable to think clearly enough to write only to have anxiety attacks at the end of the day because I feel ‐ correctly - like I got nothing done and am bad at my job. (Logically I know that I'm actually really good at my job but ykwim). Then I end up working late and it compounds with everything else and I end up exhausted and can barely help with housework and things and that then makes me feel like a terrible partner. (On the flipside I think about how much better I feel now and wonder how tf my partner stayed with me through all that - it'll be 8 years in a few months.)At this point I'm already on 400mg of lamictal and 300mg of wellbutrin so rather than increase the dose past the point of clinical evidence my psychiatrist suggested trying abilify. It feels kind of rough to add another pill to the handful since I'm also on other meds for other health issues but I just really hope it works. I care a lot about my job and what I do and I really want to be able to be more helpful around the house so I'm trying to be optimistic. Have any of y'all tried that mix? What was your experience?

I feel we are all just playing roles. And when I step outside of the roles it upsets others even when it means I’m just asking to have my needs met. Normally kind people will do the most apathetic things and then be confused if you ask them why they did that. Like they genuinely don’t know. TLDR I feel like none of this is real. Myself or others and we are all in a big simulation. I don’t feel like a real person.",Bipolar

50033,Housekeeping Therapy One of the first indicators that I'm about to have an episode (manic or depressive) is I stop cleaning. It's been that way since I was a kid.My parents were afraid I'd be a hoarder. When I moved back home I hired a cleaning lady for my parents house because I didn't want to argue with them about my bedroom after coming home from work. It was AMAZING. When I moved out I didn't have the budget for her to come to my apartment. The first year couple of years I did great but then I started grad school during the pandemic. I got overwhelmed quickly. I had enough in my budget to hire her and it's kept me healthy! She comes every 2 weeks. That motivates me to do laundry and throw away trash so it's not in her way. I wish more people could afford this as a mental health service.,Bipolar
50034,"I just keep throwing away my life. I just don't know what to do anymore. 25 year old female diagnosed at 18 and have been taking lithium on and off. Well... I went off my medications again for a few months. I went off when I was done with school receiving a certificate for my future career. Well I felt fine as I am not working currently so don't really have any stressors. Before I went fully off my medications I was not taking them consistently and I quit one of my jobs of 4 years started a new one (during the time I bought a house and was moving) and quit that one after a few months. The anxiety was the thing that was my problem I was having massive panic attacks and just had this intense self hatred for myself which then diminished my self-confidence entirely. Especially after just throwing away my life. Well just recently I got a job in the career I was going to school for for so many years... and after day 1 I quit because I had a major meltdown. Could not keep food and water down was cold sweats and shaking anxiety it took me back to last year when I also had a similar meltdown. But this time it was so intense and different. I hate myself for quitting a professional job the next freaking day. How embarrassing I literally threw away everything and I feel I will never be able to go back again. I now am deeply depressed and anxious. Cannot eat keep waking up in a panic. I wish I never went off my meds maybe I would have never quit the job and stuck it out. I don't know what my problem is. I just started my meds again I am only on lithium ER. I am currently seeing a psych doc and I have kept her out of the dark about going off my meds and how I have been taking them so inconsistently. I also want to go on the anxiety med she recommended buspar but I refused to try it because I thought I could beat it myself.. bipolar symptoms I have more control over. I am not sure if this is a part of bipolar or just separate generalized anxiety. Now everyone in my life thinks I am lazy and just don't want to work.

50036,Recently diagnosed but hesitant to get medicated Pretty self explanatory. I was recently diagnosed by a therapist with Bipolar 1. I’ve been able to use the counseling center at my university after coming back from a year long leave of absence from my masters program (likely due to a manic episode that I hadn’t recognized as a manic episode at the time). I had initially come in with the goal to reduce my chances of burn out when I was diagnosed. She recommended I see a psychiatrist to get medicated. I’ve always been highly wary of being on medication for anything especially long term. Long story short I left with a script for Depakote (500mg) to take once at night. I work overnights I intern during the day and I have classes throughout the week. I fear that getting on this med will affect my productivity (can cause sleepiness/dizziness). I guess I’m still working through accepting my diagnosis. How do I go about asking for a different med that will better work for my ever-switching sleeping schedule? I haven’t even wanted to take the Depakote. Sometimes I wonder if the diagnosis is wrong and I fear messing my brain chemistry up more.,Bipolar

I Uber so I can drive when I want and the hypomanic impulsivity isn't really something I think I can't handle. Should I just go back to raw-dogging life? I just wish I had normal brain chemistry.

Usually during the workweek I’m distracted enough that I don’t feel tired. On the weekends I’m consistently tired enough that I need a nap unless I’m super distracted by a task or social engagement. What more can I do? I go to bed at 9 or 10 pm and wake up at 6:30. I never feel rested and basically have to army-crawl out of bed. I follow every sleep hygiene tip out there (no caffeine after 2 pm block out all light and sound) other than watching TV before bed (no phone/screen time IN bed though). I get a ton of exercise at least 1 hour per day of walking my dog and walking to/from work. I also work a very physical job but it’s not my body that’s tired out it’s sleepiness. I eat clean and quit eating refined sugars about 6 weeks ago. My “junkiest” food that I eat is probably sugar-free rice putting. No fried shit no chips no fast food none of that. I also have ADHD but am not medicated for it (nothing has worked) and I’m on Seroquel but feel as tired as I did on 200 mg as I do on 100 mg.

Sometimes I get to experience long intervals of depression. Sometimes I go on a 3 week manic bender. Through all of these ups and downs I have to consistently work to survive. Yet when I need a leave of absence I get told my job cannot be guaranteed. The funny part is this industry has horrible job retention. Well it’s because they pay shit and treat you like shit and make you do the job of 3-4 departments but do not increase your pay and all the roles get looped into a miscellaneous tasks section in the job description. What hurts most is the way colleagues talk about people with mental health disorders like they’re an annoying object. “This bipolar mom…” “this un medicated dad..” “if they would just take their meds”. I have been in a manic episode where I had to go home because the impulses were going to overcome my civility. Why is there no room for me? I chose this field to help. Yet no one here wants to help. We are supposed to be professionals not letting out bias skew our service. Yet I see the attacks and I feel them for these clients too. That’s me. I am on that side. No one knows… I mask so hard and I am done. I’m burnt. I’m tired. I am losing my shit. I am in a bad low and I cannot keep up the charade. Being myself shouldn’t be this hard.

He said that we are the worst parents we never taught him anything and don't listen to him and we hate him and lie to him.

Help any advice helps!I’ve been diagnosed with BD type 1 for two years and when I got diagnosed it made so many things from my childhood make sense.I was always so “emotional and dramatic” and known as being a “cry baby” basically my entire life. To be completely honest I truly think I’ve always been bipolar (genetically not necessarily an environmental effect-although my environment didn’t help but cause more spark to the fire) Anyway I’m 27 now and I’ve decided to discontinue birth control. I currently take the pill and have the nexplanon. The combination of the two seemed to help for about five months but since having the nexplanon I have gained so much weight and have become more noticeably irritable. My episodes are more drastic and scare not only myself but others around me. Along with that my depression has gotten worse and pet of that is because of the weight of gained-it makes me so mad. I’ve tried dieting and exercising extensively. I have been told that a k eto diet helps manage symptoms of BD-not sure how true tha is. But I did do the diet for about two months and I dropped weight quick and get on top of the world. Thinking back on it now idk if that top of the world feeling was me having an episode.I few like my BD has been managed quite well but of course I struggle day to day. Everyone here knows how dark bad days can be you know how it can be. It’s scary as fuck! I want to be healthier with minimal medication and I feel like that means no more birth control. I’m hoping it helps me lose weight and decrease my depression. I also want to start a family but it worries me that my children could possibly have BD like me. No one is immune to pain and suffering but man having a mental diagnosis sure makes things a hell of a lot harder.

I also went to the annual general meeting of a society I used to be president of and called them out for their causal homophobia misogyny racism etc. These are things I wouldn't have considered doing in the past - I'd have been far too anxious and frankly conflict avoidant. Now that fear has gone and I see willing to embrace confrontation when I've been wronged. Is this just a sign of personal growth or have others experienced a surge in confrontational behaviours as well?Thanks guys and love to you all",Bipolar

50080,"To preface this probably belongs only in a diary or in the depths of the folds in my mind… This might be a mess. How are you supposed to tell somebody be it a mental health provider or a friend to confide in that you’d rather be dead than have to live with bipolar disorders I’m NOT suicidal. I’m just exhausted. The help I’ve received has been minimal at best. My original diagnosis was 10+ years ago and the treatment was and still is a joke. I was never the best patient but my doctor told me that I was the bipolar poster child. I lived at home with my single mother who moved to a different apartment at least once a year. She was a victim of domestic violence. The incident occurred around 2004 and this man (the abuser) played a minimal role in her life in the following 13 years. Even though he’s out of her life completely now she will still “play the victim card” as she’s likely consumed by thoughts of the event. That being said she refuses to confront her trauma. She played little to no part in helping me get any help for my mental illnesses or her own. Due to constantly moving when I could get any kind of professional treatment it was never long lasting. I wasn’t able to stay in therapy/psychiatry and I surely wasn’t able to stay on a medication long enough to tell if it was beneficial or not. This led to episodes of mania and depression that then led to hospitalizations that shattered my trust in everyone. My mother moved out of the apartment we lived in when I was 17. From that time until I was 20 I rapidly cycled through manic hypomanic psychotic manic and crippling depressive episodes with great intensity. I wasn’t able to tell where the mania ended and the depression began. I was mostly manic which meant I didn’t need treatment because I felt like a god; completely untouchable. I got arrested lost my job and totaled my car. My mother had put me up in my own one-bedroom apartment. After losing my job I didn’t have any income with which to pay my rent. I lost the apartment too and ended up homeless. I started to get back on my feet with a lot of help from friends family and my boyfriend at the time. I started self-medicating with cannabis and the symptoms actually started to subside for a little while. I certainly won’t say that it’s an effective treatment method for bipolar disorder because I was still cycling but I wasn’t moving through episodes so quickly. For the past 5 years I’ve noticed annual depressive episodes with shorter less severe hypo/manic episodes. I currently have a psychiatrist whose not willing to give me anything other than Abilify and Hydroxyzine which is basically just Benadryl but at least it helps me sleep at night. I’m on the waitlist for therapy with no openings in the next 90 days at least. I have a stable job steady income a car and a place to live. I try to get to the gym 3 times a week. I do yoga almost every day. Things should feel better but they don’t. I’m tired of taking care of myself. I’m tired of babying my mental health. I’m tired of trying to learn about bipolar disorder on my own because nobody ever educated me about my diagnosis. I do not have it in my anymore to keep doing all of this.",Bipolar

50086,"Excruciating manic episodes. Is this normal? After having many manic episodes (which I tried to hide) I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. Rapid cycle. Mixed state mania. All that jazz... What I experience doesn't seem to be consistent with what many other people feel. Before a full blown manic episode I feel great all my problems melt away and I hardly sleep at all. This makes sense to me. Once I pass that phase things become very extreme. I can only describe it as absolutely excruciating like being in hell. Like I'm on a ton of amphetamines and the most extreme anxiety I have ever experience. It never stops or takes a break. I never sleep or even sit down. All I can do is pace around my house all day and night for days on end. My heart is beats out of my chest the entire time. It breaks me and I'll do anything for relief. The last time I was manic after taking seroquel for a few days it brought me down to a point where I felt like I was on cocaine all the time. That I could attleat tolerate. Does anyone else have horrific manic experiences?? This doesn't seem to be consistent with everything I've read and it's been bothering me for years. I'd appreciate any input. Thanks!&amp;#x200B;On a positive note I haven't had a manic episode for almost a year. 300mg of lamotrigine does a great job keeping me down. Vraylar was very effective as well but the side effects were more than I could handle. I now take bupropion for depression which almost pushed me into mania once when I was on a lower dose of lamotrigine. Before I was diagnosed prozac pushed me into the worst manic episode I had ever experienced.",Bipolar

50090,"any tips for reducing tobacco use? I developed a serious problem with my tobacco use last year. I used to smoke about half a pack a day fairly reliably but in the wake of a very stressful cross-country move my consumption spiked to 20-25 smokes a day and I haven’t been able to get it back down yet. I have BP1 with psychotic features and my own therapist said he doesn’t know anyone with a psychotic mood disorder that doesn’t smoke so I’m not sure if actually quitting is in my future. I’ve tried before using patches and after two weeks I felt like I had a rabid rat scratching around in my head. However I do think getting back to half a pack or less is doable. My current plan is two-fold: replace some of my daily smokes with nicotine gum and instead of having the whole pack with me out on the porch where I smoke I keep them inside and only take 2 with me outside. When I’m done I’ll set a phone timer for 2 hours and not smoke until it goes off. Hopefully this will get me down to around 15 or less a day at which point I’ll either smoke every 3 hours or only have one at a time (perhaps both!). My therapist is a big fan of the harm reduction method of dealing with substance use. Yes I know that any smoking at all is bad for me but so is completely losing my mind and raging: it’s a balance.Does anyone have any thoughts regarding my plan or any additional tips that may be helpful? I’ve been smoking since I was a teenager (now 51) so it’s a deeply ingrained habit. I know I can break habits because I recently stopped smoking weed all day every day after 29 years though I still sometimes have a tiny edible at night to help with sleep and bad dreams.

Thought I was getting a loan so I could get out of debt and actually have some money to get things I desperately need since I haven’t worked in over 5 months and have had $0 since. I recently got a lawyer to try and get SSI and last week I finally found out how to apply for General aid since months ago the welfare office wouldn’t tell me how to and kept saying they only had it for families. So the loan company that pretty much got all of my info and bank turned out to be scammers and Citibank is absolute trash and their fraud department is shit. So if I wasn’t already experiencing enough stress and severe depression life decided to give me that too.

I became more consciously aware of this when I was maybe 13. I remember being restless because I could hear music but it was too clear for it to be real. I went outside my bed and didn't hear anything.I was talking to my psychiatrist maybe 2 days ago about it. If you want you can take a quick scroll through my post history but basicallyGot sexually harassed badly from a supervisor. He told told me sexual things about my body and told me he liked sliding in and coming insideWhen I reported it the manager cut my hours to zero. I have to pay for rent and food not to mention how it felt to muster up the courage to report it and then right face retaliation. I've never experienced this kind of devastation before. I can't even describe how painful the act of retaliation in itself was. I was aware I might not be believed but I didn't think I'd get punished.So I told my psychiatrist about it and almost cried. I'm still processing this information and I'm struggling. I really am.Sometimes it's music playing. More often actual music will be playing and I hear an actual person singing along with the song but they aren't. It's the most bizzare thing. I have to stare at their lips and they won't be moving. But I hear their singing very clearly.Has anything like this happened to others before?But thank God for meds. I've dipped in and out of suicidal fantasy because of it but overall it's been ok.

I grew up on my own and didn't find out I had the disorder till I was in my late teens. I wasn't able to go to college and I struggled to find work that was a fit and take care of myself for a bit but now I am happy to say I found the best job and make more money without a degree than most.This IS NOT me bragging I say all of this to show that I think we all forget sometimes that while having this disorder is a struggle it can teach us a lot of lessons. It also allows many of us to think differently and that can be a benefit. The problem is finding a way to get to stability to be able to use it in a way that doesn't make us self-destruct. I know it's hard (understatement of the year) and everyone has to find thier own path because it is definitely not one size fits all.

50115,"I suffer from a relationship I REALLY NEED HELP (Content Warning) Hello peopleI am writing to you because I need help.Please excuse me first of all because English is not my first language.I am desperate I am destroyed.I am bipolar and borderline.I am in a relationship with someone who was perfect for me at first and has since neglected me disrespected me ignored me and blamed me for everything because of my disorder.Before I met him I had managed to rebuild myself to go back to work after a 2.5 year break (I was diagnosed in 2019).Since then I have been living in hell.He lived far away from me (950km/690miles) and we tried life together but that's when my disorder revealed itself.He was constantly on the computer talking down to me having horrible outbursts and insulting me.He even threatened to kill himself and jump off my balcony and I tried to hold him back and that's when I had my first ""boderline"" crisis where I started screaming in pain and wanting to end my life.I called him parents to warn them of his actions and when they called my boyfriend said everything was fine while I was crying in the back and they could hear me.A lot of things happened and I asked him to go home (he lives with his parents).Since then it's been hot and cold between us.One day I'm ""his Queen"" the next day he barely pays attention to me and when I criticize him for not even asking if I'm okay he says ""because you think I'm your knight in shining armor?"" when for me it's the minimum for any social contact.You should know that from the beginning of our relationship I was threatened with a knife by one of his family members and insulted and while we were abroad in a remote place I didn't know.His family consults a lot of medieums psychics card readers and all of them say that I am the devil and not made for their son while I have never shown anything but goodness kindness and compassion despite what they made me go through (recently I learned that they would be persuaded that I raped their son and that my first goal is to ""kill him"" while I have never raised my hand on someone).They even told me while her sister wanted hut me with the knife that it was ok because ""the devil is INSIDE HER' and so it means that it's not her fault and they didn't event ask if I was fine once ?!Last week was the worst of all I hurt myself I hit my head multiple times during his present and I tore my face off + hit myself with an alter because I heard his parents on the phone saying again that I was going to kill him and he did nothing to stop it and instead he left when I could have killed myself.I am stuck in this relationship I don't know how to get out of it.I feel like I can't see any way out because I feel like no one will want me because I'm ""crazy"" and I don't want to live with someone like him nor do I want to start a family with him because of the principles he may have and his family (I can't tell you everything but the story of the knife already tells you a lot)I need help my caregivers don't tell me anything they listen to me and that's it.No one understands me.The more I talked to him about my illness and how to help me if I was neglected the more he did nothing.When we lived together and he insulted me I took it upon myself at first and went to him with a big smile and hugged him as he pushed me hard and said ""YOU DISGUST ME!"" to then tell me ""sorry I love you more than anything you can't even imagine I will never leave you alone again I will do the work for both of us as you have done for the past 7 months everything it's over I'm not going to abandon you anymore it's up to me to make sure that you become again the one you were before my family and I broke you"" then suddenly it's ""you're responsible for everything it's is because you are hypersensitive""His family hates me because I'm ""too pretty too nice too cuddly to be true"" when I'm just me!I can't take it anymore yesterday and this morning I wanted to end it I can't tell myself that I'm going to get out of this I can't tell myself that I'm going to manage to escape of him because I'm hooked in spite of myself and I don't know why because we no longer live together and it's a daily suffering.He's h24 on his computer he just plays he has nothing to talk about we don't share anything anymore (he was different at first it was amazing then he showed his face when he moved in with me).I just asked him again if we could call because I need help because I'm in pain I'm taking xanax for the first time in my life in addition to my usual treatments when I've always managed to do without (and even with that it doesn't work)I'm begging you help me advise me I don't know but I need help from people who understand me.

50116,unloved I feel like I’m too hard to love. I’m in my late 20s and I have bp II. I’ve been medicated and going to therapy regularly for years but I still have mood swings etc. i thought I managed it well? I’m a lesbian and I try really hard to make relationships work but in the end I’m always too much. I even escaped an abusive one. It hurts so badly. Especially when i think about the fact that in multiple relationships when my partners were going through their depressions (not bipolar but reg depression) I held them down to the point of putting their needs and feelings above my own and neglecting myself (which I now know is unhealthy). And then they get better..But the second I start struggling I’m “too much” and they don’t know if they can do it. It’s frustrating because I’m really upfront about the fact that I have bp II and they’ll say it doesn’t matter etc but when the symptoms show up they bail. If you ask my exes or anyone I’ve dealt with romantically 9 times out of 10 they’ll describe me as sweet/bubbly and one said I was amazing. But if that’s true why can’t they love me. I just want to be loved. I want to get married one day and maybe have a child and live happily ever after but I feel like that’ll never happen for me or it won’t last because I’ll have an episode and everything will be ruined.,Bipolar

50121,just diagnosed with BP2 feeling lost and looking for inspo. After years of getting nowhere with SSRIS therapy and functional medicine I have finally been diagnosed with bipolar 2. I feel anger at my parents and doctors for not helping me when this started showing up in high school (I am 29 now). I will be starting medication next week after my psych goes over my metabolic panel. I have a good job now (software engineer) and am repairing myself financially for all the excessive spending and credit I took out but I feel so alone in my relationships and sometimes think I will never be able to be a wife and mother with this disease. I feel grateful for this diagnosis as I can now begin to forgive myself for all my outbursts in the past but the grief is so heavy over the time I lost and how much this damaged my self esteem over the years. Is it really possible to begin again after starting medication and therapy? Looking for some serious inspiration here. Love to everyone in this community.,Bipolar

I was doing therapy (combo biofeedback with the intent to get to emdr) for a few months and taking 200mg lamotrigine and 10mg Lexapro but I haven't been to therapy in months because of distance and cost and I've been off my meds for months because the lamoteigine (I think) was causing me sleep problems. I work 9 hr days and 6 days a week most weeks while also helping my husband (35m) with his online business (usually don't get home most nights until 9:30). Here's where my problems start.My husband wants sex a lot. When we first got together we had sex every day for like a year. Then it started to slow some but was never really an issue. Now we have sex maybe once a week and it's putting a strain on our marriage. He feels like I don't love him or want him or want to be around him anymore. None of those are true and in my mind I have valid reasons for not wanting to have sex when he initiates. I have the kyleena IUD so I get some pretty painful cramps sometimes or I'm tired or it's late when we get home and I have to be at work a 6 am. Recently an additional pronlem is that I've become self-conscious about how I look again. He says I don't initiate enough or respond when he tries to get me in the mood. I tried to explain to him my reasons but he said I'm making it sound like a chore and sometimes it does feel that way until I'm actually in the act and enjoying it. It feels like too much work or too much sleep loss in exchange for little. I've gotten to the point where if we do have sex I prefer quickies. He also says that when I initiate when he's tried he doesn't turn me down unless he's exhausted.Things are very strained. I feel like I'm sleeping in bed with a stranger like an old fashioned we've never loved together or had sex before marriage type of relationship. I hate it and I hate that I can't pinpoint a cause or how to fix it. Is it mania? Depression? Stress? IUD? Exhaustion?

(she’s like the most hated girl in school the one i didn’t want to sit by). i made this whole weird plan about her getting there early and bringing binders that are labeled the sport i play on it to pretend we are planning sports camps. then said it would be good for national honors society. honestly if you guys want more information about the message i sent to her i can copy and paste it i just really don’t want to because it’s embarrassing and hard to look back on. she responded well even though she hated her for a while too. she just said “she’s going through a lot just smile” which is a perfect mature answer. i talked to her (when i wasn’t manic) about how she is a really good remodel and i inspire to her and she really liked that. but before i did that ⚠️ IMPORTANT PART ⚠️i texted my other friend(idk what we are now) about it. i said in voice memos that i was manic and wrote a whole paragraph about how i hated this girl then sent it to my other friend. this other girl who i was talking about before i wrote “important part” is someone she would say rather be friends with then me. then i spammed her with tiktoks afterward the voice memo because i told her i didn’t want to be embarrassing by it in the future??? i don’t know what i said it was clearly something i’d never say. the REAL PROBLEM is her mother has bipolar. but like the stereotypical bipolar not something that i would be like. she says stuff that you could probably image very disfunctional women and the father is too. this was probably a huge trigger for her. i forgot about it until i tagged her in a post and left me on read. then i asked her questions about the sport and she was never a dry texter and said stuff like yes no sure i realized then and remembered what happened. i texted her to ask if i could call her tomorrow and she said “sure” that was like 3-7 days ago though. i’m not sure whether to call her text her or even address this situation. if i did address it how would i would i call her text her or??? this is just a very hard situation and idk what to do. please help me",Bipolar
50127,"Bipolar Disorder type II is compromising my relationship and I feel beleaguered. How do others navigate relationships while undermedicated/still finding out which meds work for them? I have recently moved in with my partner from across the nation. We had known each other for a long time since we were in the same community-focused nonprofit organization. We had spent a substantial time building an intimate rapport with each other and we began to fully believe we were madly in love with each other. Unfortunately when I moved in the true depth of my mental unwellness quickly forced its way to the surface. My bipolar disorder shares a dangerous comorbidity with various other mental injuries to include combat PTSD from my time in the Marine Corps community trauma from being raised in poverty and general childhood trauma which has resulted in an additional major depressive disorder diagnosis. My mood cycles rapidly as in several times in one day rapidly. The resulting agitation fills my head with various examples of why the relationship will never work despite her initial fervor to cater to my every need. Now she’s exhausted beleaguered and on the precipice of lapsing back into previous trauma behavior—she has PTSD from witnessing her ex-fiancée shoot himself in the head right in front of her. I have become the single most stressful thing in her life and I’ve repeatedly attempted to leave the relationship as a result but she would refuse to let me leave. I’m exhausted and I have a maelstrom of dark thoughts swirling through my head. Our relationship has devolved into resentment petty squabbles and she no longer has the energy to convince me to stay when I feel compelled to flee from the relationship even though she states she still wants me to stay even if she doesn’t have the energy to stop me from leaving. I can’t seek solace in my partner because we have become a point of contention in each others’ lives and if I keep venting to my best friend she’ll begin to grow resentful of my partner for being what she may perceive as unhealthy for me even though I share a large portion of the blame for causing our relationship to devolve to this point. She constantly states how she needs support and cannot withstand the capricious nature of my mood swings on her own which breaks my heart to hear because now I’m fully convinced that I am far too much more trouble than I’m worth and that I am no where near at a point in my mental health recovery to be a healthy boyfriend.Who has experienced something similar and how did they navigate such an emotionally compromising situation?",Bipolar

Now since last week (almost exactly 2 weeks after upping the two) the pattern has started doing something extra weird....Now instead of just going up-down-up-down like it was before there's a day ""break"" between the solid up and down ... and it's not euthymia it's like a funky mixed thing going on where it rapidly switches back and forth between lighter versions of both sides with each side ranging anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour. Then it switches into a 'full state' for a day to continue the cycle (usually it goes in order but it doesn't always).So my question is ... I really can't understand exactly what this means ... does this mean it's getting better or worse? I'm trying to figure out if maybe the med changes are in the right direction or if this is actually worsening ... in some ways I'd say better (since the number of 'full' cycles is technically slowed a little) but for more obvious reasons it may be worse. Also these bouncy days are pretty obnoxious when it comes to doing things like work because I can't actually maintain a flow since it keeps changing on me.Has anyone had any sorta situation like this before? Do you think this is a path toward better or is it actually getting worse? I would think a question like that would be obvious but ... it isn't for this o_O",Bipolar
50153,"Why do negative social interactions give me such existential dread? How to cope? I’m posting here because I’m technically diagnosed as bipolar and I suspect it could potentially be related in the form of overthinking.Overall I’ve had pretty stable mental health since I graduated college and started working. College was hell and now I occasionally get hypomanic but nothing extreme. Even less frequently do I ever feel depressed. All without meds (has bad side effects didn’t really help felt like it kept me in a “sick” mindset but I digress). So I think I’m doing great overall. I feel privileged in that way.But something I still struggle with is this feeling of existential dread I get when I mistake a mistake am wrong or am just being trolled.I have many examples but one today was someone on an academic subreddit telling me I’m wrong about something and implied I’m an idiot that doesn’t know what I’m talking about. All when this person couldn’t refute what I was saying and was generally being a d*ck focused on me being wrong instead of trying to discuss as a community.Others have been related to feeling secluded in my field of work because I research a type of illness our product exacerbates to find preventative measures. So sometimes I have to trigger people and if I try to find colleagues to talk to “it could harm the business” which my boss is annoyed about (not violating any NDAs)But I digress.Basically anytime I get shut down by someone one way or another I have thoughts of just not wanting to continue on. Just being unable to cope with other people. I don’t perceive them as being s*icidal like I wouldn’t act on it or plan or anything. But just a feeling of anxiety and fear from making social mistakes (like fearing being canceled for a misunderstanding). I just feel like I don’t know how to move on. Then I think my hypomania kicks that overthinking into overdrive.All until I sleep and wake up the next day. Usually but not always. Sometimes it does lead to dysthymia or depression.I’ve never really had a lot of friends. I’m married in a great relationship with great (international) in-laws but I don’t have regular friends I hang out with (mostly friendships of convenience like classmates) nor do I have a good family. I guess I generally feel like I don’t really have people to support me.Despite being able to get by in most social situations fine I don’t have a real social life and always feel lacking or like I know how to talk to people in personal. Like I only have enough social skills to survive and pass as normal but maybe awkward sometimes. But the awkwardness and not knowing what to do in social situations is what Sara me up",Bipolar

50155,"How do I stop spending money??? I’ll preface this post with the fact that I have bipolar and I’m young. I know both those things contribute to the impulse of money spending. I am still in college and my parents give me money for necessities (groceries therapy gas money to visit home). I DID have a regular job but I quit because of how toxic the workplace was. I babysit pretty regularly and I am in the running for a job as a ghost tour guide so it’s not like I CAN’T afford frivolous things but I do feel bad about not having basically any money in my savings ($20 to my name right now! It’s insane)I am no longer someone who buys clothes just because I like them but I did go up a few sizes due to medication increase and diet change so I’ve been having to replace a lot of my old clothes. I always shop at goodwill though and lately I haven’t had to buy that much. I don’t buy house decor anymore since I am definitely fulfilled in that aspect. I only buy art supplies when my current ones are totally out of use.I think I impulse buy fast food or even restaurant food super easily when I can just cook it or use my meal plan at school. I only have to pay $1k-2k per year at school due to scholarships and financial aid but it’s still a big chunk (my parents now pay half ever since I quit my job). My biggest vice however is legos. I buy so many legos especially when I’m feeling anxious. They’re a super efficient distraction and a really engaging hobby. Even my parents support it because they see how it calms me and makes me happy. But my issue is that whenever I get any sort of significant money I immediately go to buy legos. I don’t know how to stop or budget or anything or put any of it into a savings account without just taking it right back out. It’s like every other week at this point.I need help. How do you all save money? You all know what I do and don’t spend it on so do you have any tips?",Bipolar
50156,"Needing advice/support I had a manic episode about 6 months ago that has completely derailed my life. I quit my dream job (burned professional bridges too) left my home and my Roomate to find another place to live quickly moved to a city where I knew no one left personal belongings behind racked up $14k in credit card debt. I met someone I shouldn’t have trusted and helped him buy a car. Luckily I was able to sell it but I also bought myself a new car I didn’t need. I am now 10k underwater in a car loan and had to move back in with my parents. I am close to 30 years old. My professional career is destroyed and I lost most of my friendships.

50157,"i hate manic episodes I detest how no one understands that I’m not okay even when I’m not depressed. My hypomanic episodes always start lightly - actually eating properly cleaning the entire house talking to people etc. and people will “congratulate me” (“you finally got up/cleaned the mess you live in”) and are all happy that I’m somehow fine and cured now. Then it gets worse and I’ll start to get angry easily hit stuff yell at people over the smallest things get drunk or high with anything close by. I’ll do illegal shit steal stuff or try to harm myself either by relapsing staying awake until passing out or straight up attempting suicide because why not. And everyone blames me for it. In their eyes I am choosing to destroy the supposed progress from my depressive episodes; “Why would you do that to yourself?” and “I thought you were doing better.” No I’m fucking not.It’s dumb I know it shouldn’t make me so angry but I hate that no one around me is capable of grasping the fact that I’ll always be sick- that it’s not something that will just leave.

I need a job now but I don't have any idea how I'm gonna get one and keep one as I have physical health issues as well so retail doesn't really mesh with me. I'm just so mad at myself and at my psychiatrist. Meds don't work even though I take them religiously.

50191,"On Moods and Mania I have been thinking a lot about this today and I just want to share some thoughts with you guys. It has been 18 years since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That I live with this is no surprise to anybody who knows me. This disease is so much more nuanced than the typical ""extreme ups and downs"" description it usually receives. I have survived two absolutely devastating depressions and approximately twenty manic episodes. Attempting to describe what mania is like is the worst frustration. It happens gradually and then comes upon me like a brick to the face. First I stop sleeping then the creativity comes. The blank page beckons to me the way freshly baked bread might entice the starving. It is soft at first subtle even but the persistent pen-to-page prevails and soon I am unable to make sense of or even put into context the hasty and paranoid puzzle of words. Grandiosity accompanies the writing then the delusions come and I believe that this puzzle of words is worthy of a Pulitzer. Other things happen too; reckless driving substance use rage impulsivity irrationality.... Ultimately I surrender to complete psychosis. Saying it is ""a lot"" is an understatement. I have destroyed and lost relationships with family members and friends because of this illness. I have said and done unforgivable things. But it is my deepest wish that people understand that becoming manic is not a choice it has happened to me whilst on medication and off alike. I would never choose it. I'm simply reflecting on all of this today because earlier I read this: Bipolar disorder results in 9.2 years reduction in expected life span and as many as one in five patients with bipolar disorder completes suicide. (National Institute of Mental Health).That's the reality. It's my reality. I do not want to ever become a statistic and I want to live as full a life as possible.Here is what I'm grateful for: I have an incredible support network. I have doctors and therapy. I have the most loving and supportive family and friends ones who are able to look beyond my illness and recognize that I am not ""me"" in those manic moments. And I am grateful for the ability to empathize with all those who struggle. We can do together what we could never do alone.",Bipolar

50193,"i hate the way media depicts mania i (16ENBY) have been told i show signs of bipolar by multiple professionals. they can’t diagnose me since i’m young though. this made me analyze my behaviors and realize when i was manic. movies and shows make mania seem fun. it makes it seem like a drug. it can be fun. it can be euphoric. but it’s usually so unbelievably painful. it’s excoriating. when i told my friends i was probably bipolar they didn’t really bat an eye they saw me being reckless and doing risky things and they thought it was fun. mania is so much anger. it’s such a deep anger i can’t explain it and i’ve realized that’s a symptom and not everyone feels it. it’s such a trip. all the things i thought were normal were probably symptoms. my friends thought mania was fun they saw movies of people going out and doing drugs they saw me going out and doing drugs but when i explained what it’s like they were terrified. and they should be. this isn’t fun. bipolar isn’t fun. mania needs to stop being romanticized. your perception of reality shifts you’re angry and even more angry that no one can help you. you do reckless things because you just don’t care. you’re filled with so much self hatred and if the consequence isn’t immediate death than it doesn’t matter. it’s not fun. i can’t explain how un fun it is. it’s so unstable you can’t control your emotions it’s constantly changing. it reminds me of Vampire Diaries. when they’re in transition their emotions are magnified. it can be fun but they’re usually a mess hurting themselves being destructive drinking hating themselves. i’m not sure why i made this post. i feel cheated kind of? everyone makes mania seem so fun and crazy and like a movie but it’s scary.",Bipolar

My body immediately started screaming to the point of throat hurting afterwards I was extremely terrified and scared about our safety. For the first time I was actually staring at something shadowy moving; it wasn't just a sharp movement in the corner of my eye but something I could look at and it would still be looking absolutely scary.

50195,Mania is changing with age I am 27 and have a 1.5 year old. I have found that my mania and hypomania is significantly different at this point in my life than when I was in my late teens and early 20s.

I feel hypomanic for sure right now and I find myself filling my calendar with volunteer opportunities and weekend events to take the kids (I'm a step mom too) to. And honestly I'm super grateful.

I do want to say my anxiety has been higher recently too A couple months ago I started losing my appetite to where I’d only get hungry in the late afternoon or evening. About a week and a half ago it stopped all together and I’m struggling to eat.Now when I try to eat I feel so disgusted by food I’ll start gagging and have to spit out the food or else I’ll throw up. I’ve been living off ensure drinks and trying so hard to make myself eat in between I messaged my psychiatrist about everything that’s been going on and she said to see the doctor to rule out the flu. I went. Don’t have the flu. They did every blood test imaginable- everything came back great. I did a Covid test and that was negative. After telling my psych the updates she thinks it’s that I’m “not absorbing latuda effectively with my GI symptoms” I don’t think I fully understand what she means. She also suggested that I switch to Zyprexa / olanzapine instead of the latuda. I messaged my therapist today hoping for something else I guess and all she asked was if I started the zyprexa. Not eating is making me feel so weak and dizzy and I feel so sick all the time. I want to just eat normally again so bad.

Hey allI was recently diagnosed bipolar 1 but am sitting in the tattered remains of my life wondering how I could have believed what I did.I first felt symptoms of mania and intense narcissism this summer (I’m 28 yrs old). I had recently gone through a breakup with my partner of 6 years had fallen in love with my female best friend (first queer experience) and she did not reciprocate my feelings and my workload had become incredibly overwhelming.I started losing weight and hair had a stress rash on my body and was experiencing fluctuating feelings between paranoia to believing the universe was speaking to me directly.But theres a delusion I am struggling with the most that has left me feeling horrid and unforgivable. I believed my wonderful boss of 3 years had emotionally abused me and was the reason I was experiencing mania and psychosis. I believed this so hard I convinced myself and my therapist/psychiatrist I had PTSD and that my boss and workplace were all to blame. I told so many people this was what happened to me because I truly believed it. I blocked my boss on everything and didn’t talk to her for 6 months.This January I finally looked back at the texts that I thought “proved” I was abused and found nothing but support and concern from a woman who never did anything but treat me with respect.How the hell does this happen? Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? Honestly I’ve been feeling suicidal since the realization- I got fired from my job for other mistakes I made while manic but I don’t know how to tell I everyone I talked to that what I believed for the last 6 months was a total lie.Please help 😣",Bipolar
50206,"Imposter Syndrome and anxiety about learning more about this disorder Hi. This post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome so I want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if they've been able to circumvent it. I was officially diagnosed with BP2 by my psychiatrist in the fall but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist. Bipolar 2 makes sense to me it tracks with situations and periods of my life where I was feeling unnaturally confident and ""fun"" in a dangerous way and more often the periods where I've been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks. Still I have this weird fear of learning more about Bipolar Disorder because there's a part of me that fears that if I read about it in-depth I might start mirroring symptoms that I don't usually experience. Sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and r/bipolar2.I think being medicated with varied success also plays into that but I also think that's just a common bipolar experience: you find good meds and then you wonder if you're even bipolar. I feel that way when they work but I keep on taking them. And then I will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds and I wonder if it's a sign that I have something else wrong with me. So to those that have survived imposter syndrome... How? Is there a way to not be afraid to learn about your own medically diagnosed disorder... Or to just accept that I have this disorder without constantly questioning myself?",Bipolar

I have this very strong feeling I'm not good enough to have friends or relationships because of all these things. ie to keep people safe away from me/no one wants to be around someone like that probably. This makes it easier when I'm having a depressive episode to push everyone away without thinking I'm doing so. I feel like just the thought makes my depressive episodes worse.

Before that it was either really depressed and a bit of mixed and latest major hypomanic episode in summer 2021. So it had been a while and the thing is I'm still very slow and sleep a lot but compared to before when I slept 10-12 hours a night every 24h now I still sleep 10-12h but I stay awake 24h+ multiple times a week.Last friday I went to my psychiatrist and he asked me if I had any hints of impulsivity that could indicate hypomania specifically spznding sex and substance abuse (ya know the usual menu).And I thought about it for a moment (in retrospect I was making up excuses that would make things logical) and then said no just spending but for necessary stuff.And here I am exactly a week later wearing one of my two new wigs that arrived from aliexpress yesterday (I had only bought one super cheap one before) been smoking weed since monday and unpacking my new dildo in my newly fairyland garden themed decorated kitchen. Oh also received 150 bucks worth of beauty products (I've never done skincare before in my life except sheet masks and face creams from aldi).For clarification I bought it all before seeing my psychiatrist and smoking again.How could I not see it???And im still doubting it while also having a super intense and insane to the point it's and unhealthy crush on someone ??Who am I kidding...",Bipolar

Once the episode passed and reality started to hit me I went to my boss and explained myself. Luckily he's a really chill boss and after talking a bit we decided to come to an agreement about lessening my workload to help ease the stress I feel at work. But y'all this disorder is no joke. I almost put myself in a very bad situation. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I hate how this disorder can quickly mess up my life if I'm not careful.,Bipolar

50246,"How do I accept that I’m bipolar? I just can’t get it out of my head that I’m not.But this past January I:-thought I was an Aztec chased by jaguars and loved the feeling of fighting for my life. It was exhilarating. -thought the Starbucks mermaid lady was laughing at me and that walls were moving. Also heard some voices.-walked through puddles in the rain and got my clothes and shoes sopping wet because I thought I’d be reincarnated as a mentally healthy person-saw cameras where there were none -thought people on the bus were plotting to kill me -thought an escalator was gonna eat me-kept dissociating -pretended to eat my fingers like they were chicken tenders looked in the mirror and thought my mouth was full with my fingers and laughed at myself then I was horrified.-in my head was thinking “I must grab the skin and scooped it out” and realized I was picking at my face and stopped myself -overall I was unstable for around 2 weeks-was incredibly depressed for around a month afterwards But I was able to reality check. I was very agitated but I worked okay and hid the symptoms successfully and let myself enter the other world when I was alone. I don’t remember how sleep went but it wasn’t bad. I took myself to the hospital when I almost walked into traffic bc I was dissociating badly and terrified by the mix of suicidal/self-destructive thoughts and intense glee. But I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and then later at a php another psychiatrist confirmed the diagnosis?And these past four days I’ve had unbearable amounts of energy. Rock climbed for hours. Disappeared in music to the point that I forgot I was listening to music and the noises scared me. Everything feels so good. It feels good on my fingers to type this. I can feel the energy of cars passing by. I can feel the patterns of tree branches. Also irritated with other people at points (they talk too slow!). Have had trouble sleeping and feel fine. Felt connected to the universe. Felt funny in my head. I’m on lithium so I’m self aware and I don’t get as many bizarre thoughts as I did the first time around.But I don’t get the urge to buy things. On this subreddit people say they buy things but I don’t do that. And now Im beginning to feel a bit of sleepiness and mania has to last seven days to be mania doesn’t it? I feel like I’m faking it.

50252,"I Am Worried I Actually Don't Want to Get Better Hi everyoneI have been seeing the same therapist for almost two months now. While I think we are working well together I am getting the feeling that I am repeating myself every session. I just can't help but overthink my whole life. This tends to obsessively question my career constant negative self talk and occasional suicidal ideation (although I could never take action so its mostly more self torture). I'm eating maybe 1 to 2 meals a day inconsistently showering never doing laundry and so lethargic that I mostly just lay down and watch tv/YouTube whenever I get home from work. I don't take walks I don't try to think positively I don't really exercise I don't practice gratefulness etc etc. I feel like a loser but the thing is...I don't make any effort to change or feel better.My therapist keeps clearly telling me this rumination is simply not beneficial. I know this is true but it feels impossible to stop. I can't feel better without taking action (again total agreement with my therapist) but taking action is so hard. Its getting to the point where I am thinking I am comfy in my misery. I no longer have hypomanic phases thanks to medication but at least when I was hypomanic I was putting in effort to better myself. This nonstop depression is so consistent I am beginning to hypothesize that its not really depression but me continuously self sabotaging myself and always blaming it on something external.Can anyone relate? Would you say this is just more negative rumination or overthinking? If not how does one shake the refusal to take action for their own sake?",Bipolar
50253,"Manic for 6 months ending up in jail where I had a suicide attempt. 38m. February 2022 I finalized my divorce. I had been trapped in a dysfunctional marriage for 7 years. During those years I was incredibly stable but incredibly over medicated. Towards the end when things were at their worst I was alone self medicating with alcohol. During those years I was on Venlafaxine Seroquel and Lamotragine.In February with a fresh start to life I started exercising and eating better. I stayed away from my phone and computer and I would go out and socialize. I started looking better and feeling better. Knowing the side effects of the meds I started tweaking the dosages. Seroquel in particular is incredibly sedating so I thought I could go down a natural route managing my bipolar with healthy stress management. I saw improvements. I had more energy my rest was better. I kept lowering the dosages and kept seeing improvements with my mood and energy. I was aware of the risk of mania so I was very acute in getting enough sleep and if I needed to I would use seroquel more as a PRN.Fast forward to June and this slope lead me to a path where I was completely off all medication. I was making strides in all areas of my life. In particular my relationship with my daughter. We were having a blast and an incredible start to the summer with my motivation and optimism for life. All while this was happening I was keeping watch on my mania never denying that it could pop up at some point.It would be about when July hit that the first occurrences of mania became apparent in retrospect but wasn't obvious or out of control at the time. It was the beginnings of losing touch with reality. Passing interactions with other people I would sometimes get a hint that I had a larger purpose. But they were fleeting and rare so I didn't take notice.By the end of July I was semi-regularly battling against these thoughts that the strangers I would come across would be part of a conspiracy and that there was some purpose behind their being there. I was in conflict with myself. 90% of me didn't believe it and thought it was ridiculous 9% thought that it was my duty to be humble with getting recognition and attention and 1% was feeding into the delusion.By the end of August I was getting exhausted with the notion of being at the center of everything. I hated the idea that I had to be studied admired and protected. I ""knew"" that something was happening on the outside world and I didn't know if I was seen as a reconciler of religion science and all cultures. I was seen as the person to bring the whole world together and the inspiration of a movement that could potentially solve any problem. It was seen as the opportunity for aliens to finally make their presence known.By the end of September I knew there were reasons that ""the movement"" couldn't directly come to light to me and I being in a sort of partnership with the movement I started giving my personal belongings away. I would donate my clothes my coin collection my golf clubs my old baseball glove and most of my other stuff. It was my belief that each item would go to a person in need and every item would be cherished by someone. I sort of expected to get something in return but never did of course. Or if I did I stole it thinking I was meant to steal it. I was also writing and doing art at this point which I was also leaving behind on purpose in public places.When October rolled around I quit my job because when the world was following me I saw my job as a way for me to feel normal for a while. I didn't want to give up my old life but I had a higher calling. It would have been around October 24th when I was completely exhausted from all of this. I couldn't handle the pressure. I couldn't handle the fact that most of me still didn't believe this shit but that brainwashing-propaganda-part-of-the-brain that kept feeding me these thoughts I was exhausted fighting that all those months.I had the idea to go find some weed. I never smoked it before in my life. So I went to a vape store and asked if they had anything that could get me high. They gave me a canister and a battery. I didn't look at it or do any research because with everything being planted and all information to my phone being filtered there was no point. I went home and smoked it. I went into a panic immediately. Thinking I was going to die I called an ambulance. They came but they didn't seem too concerned when they got here. I was getting frustrated because they weren't taking this ""emergency"" seriously.I was out of my mind psychotic. I fell to the floor ""devolving"" from a human to a werewolf to smaller and smaller mammals up to and including being a microorganism. I remember ""going offline"" and coming back online a few times. I remember seeing a coordinate graph where the line kept splicing off the edge and it felt like I kept dying. It felt like I was shedding timelines where I actually died there but I kept surviving in this one. I remember being in the bed in the ambulance with the EMT and he would turn from male to female and I wrestled with the idea of ""male"" and ""female"" at the most abstract level (almost like properties of the universe). I remember re-living my life organized in different ways and coming back to the EMT each time thinking that this is the infinite cycle of existence. I have only small fragments after that but apparently I had a ""freak out"" moment in the hospital and they saw it as me being aggressive to one of the personnel. I was arrested handcuffed and brought to jail charged with a felony simple assault on emergency personnel.In jail my parents were not willing to bail me out without being on meds. The jail system here is completely dysfunctional and there's basically no mental health support so there was no way for me to get on my meds. After about 3 days living in an open dorm situation the other inmates took notice of my behavior and obvious mental health issues. They're bored and destructive people so they preyed on my mental weakness and I stayed strong as best I could. I can't go into every thought I had but there was a night that I thought my family was kidnapped and were being tortured and murdered one by one. The inmates were feeding the thoughts and when it got to my daughter I couldn't hear anymore. I went into the bathroom got as high as I could (about 8 feet) jumped and pushed off the ceiling trying to land my head on the concrete. I didn't lean back far enough and landed on my spine. The pain was intense and I threw up the shampoo soap and cleaner that I drank about an hour earlier. I shit my pants and was writhing in pain. The officers rushed in to check things out. I pleaded for them to shoot me telling them it will save my daughter. I kept begging them to do it. They told me to get up. Walking to suicide isolation I felt reassured that what I did put an end to them murdering my family. I was in suicide watch for 20 days which if someone weren't suicidal would make someone. I had no clothes but a velcro towel and I had to shit in a hole and smash the turd down with my foot so it would go through the bars. I couldn't have more than a few squares of toilet paper. Nothing to read. My bed was the concrete. I'm not complaining because it is what it is. It's jail and I was there. But what was the worst part is the back pain lying on the concrete. No position felt good it was simply finding the least painful position and last as long as I could before that became too much and just keep shuffling to find something that's tolerable for just a moment.After 28 days there were enough people who got involved that I was finally able to get released on bail with a treatment order. I got back on my meds and I've been on them since. I've slipped into a real bad depression. The charges were dropped 10 days ago. I'm resuming my job search (it's impossible to find a job with 'assault' on your record). The arrest itself can still be found if an employer does a certain background check but nothing I can do about that. I slipped into drinking semi-regularly but I've pulled out of that the last 2 weeks. All in all I'm holding on by a thread but there is hope.Oh I forgot that the night of the incident. I had all my money $20k dollars in cash stolen from my apartment. I have no proof but my intuition tells me that one of the officers took it when they were searching my apartment.",Bipolar

50258,Trying sobriety... again I think we all know how drinking goes with Bipolar. It only makes things worse. I used to get drunk every day and had to detox several times before my diagnosis.

I'm not taking my meds consistently my mood is all over the place I'm paranoid as hell and having near constant panic attacks. So I haven't had anything to drink since Sunday and I got a prescription for naltrexone which I'm taking religiously.

The older I get the worse it becomes. Medication just numbs the feeling but it is always there below the surface. I am so exhausted. No matter how much sleep I get how long I lay on the couch stare at TV no matter how many pills I take the void eats away at me. I am just so tired. Every muscle in my body feels like I have been working out for years with no rest days. So tight like they might shatter like glass if I breathe the wrong way. My fingers bleed from picking at them.

There are so many instances where I get set off by small/lighthearted comments. At times I have gone off on people for really small things and it has ruined relationships. This is while being relatively “stable” too. What I mean is this has been when I’m not depressed or manic. Another thing I’ve noticed is that if someone makes a comment that hurts my feelings it really hurts me. To the point where I become severely depressed and question why I should go on with life if I can’t do xyz and people don’t appreciate me. There have been 2 instances where friends haven’t responded to my messages right away and I explode. One of those instances was when I was manic. I have ruined those two friendships.

They tell me hes way more deserving of treatment and care than me which I can kind of understand. They all look at me with such shame and disappointment.

I can’t stand feeling the dry peeling skin rubbing against my other fingers…~I’ve been diagnosed so long and have taken tons of medication and I still feel like I just will never be normal? Like at this point what does a normal person experience in their day to day feelings?~I’ll go through a month of reading books on my kindle or regular books and finish them like in 3-4 days 1 I finished in a month. Same with watching a series on like HBO max or Hulu….I go through moods of deeply into the show and just binge it so fast &amp; then a week later it’s like I can’t even focus or have enough attention span to watch anything at all? My mind is constantly thinking about the next I need to do like it doesn’t stop whatsoever… only time I feel relaxed is when my night meds hit…sleeping is the best bc it takes me from this hell of reality I struggle with daily.

But I know that’s not a great sign because that hasn’t happened in half a year or so. At this point I’m just bracing for impact and waiting to see if it’s hypomania or not. I say hypomania/mania because I experience both and my therapist still can’t decide if it’s bipolar I or II. Possibly an issue of deciding if the mania was actually full blown mania.

I don't believe in mental illness they are all symptoms of trauma and discrimination or whatever intoxication of delusional feelings that other brought into our minds we got fed up with them and developed an unhealthy mind and behaviour because we got stuck in them. I think the wish to have power or isolating ourselves from others to be distinguished is something I noticed about me. On the other hand we can't deny we are more sensible and perceptive.

So let me use an example bc I do not know what to do with myself right now I've been having a very bad depressive episode this week and today I needed the help of someone very close to me who also happens to be my coworker. I messed up life has been extra overwhelming lately and it's hard to work I can't focus and even the smallest of things drain me even if those around me don't see it it's so hard to do daily tasks im so tired of it all. I messed up and there was an order I did not place by mistake I forgot about it and I even forgot what I had spoken to this particular client about. I was sure he remembered who I was and i was terrified of looking like a dumbass and him asking for a supervisor bc this is the kind of person he is. So I asked my friend to help me I was frantic and I am one to always help anyway I can when there's a mistake on their part or anything goes down no matter how busy I am with my own things. They did not seem thrilled that I asked for help and didn't even get a confirmation on whether or not they'd help. Perhaps I'm making this bigger than it is but it was hurtful to see how unwilling they were to help me while I was panicking. I rarely ask anything of anybody bc I have learned to be self-sufficient and bc with bipolar I have 0 friends. I'm just sad that I didn't get a smidgen of consideration and just went for it on my own. Issue is being resolved now and after 20 minutes my coworker has approached me to say ""So what do I have to do?"" Meaning when I explained everything earlier including the solution they were not even paying attention. I told them I got it now and they walked away annoyed. Is this me just raging for no reason?

50309,"Telling people you are bipolar I just wanted like opinions/consensus on this cuz I’m curious. Who in your life do you tell that you are bipolar? (I think this might be a bit of a generational difference here too.) I work in healthcare and hear the way people talk about bipolar patients all the time I don’t have many Gen-Z coworkers for context most Gen-X boomers or millennials and it’s abysmal. (I’m a millennial for context). They talk about us the same way people would talk about people convicted for domestic abuse or a hit and run or a violent crime. Just disdain. So I would never tell anyone at work that and broadly speaking these people are supposed to be empathetic and nice healthcare workers. So I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what people actually think of us when they don’t have to be politically correct about it cuz they know they aren’t speaking to people who will be directly hurt or offended by what they have to say. I’ve noticed younger people like people on tik tok or like just in general not only talk about it but put it front and center as a key piece of their identity. They put it in cover letters that go out to job applications and to me this just seems wildly naïve. I wish we didn’t live in that world but we have negative stereotypes about being late being unreliable or substance abuse issues and even though a lot of us don’t do those things often or at all. People who have power to dictate important parts of our lives like what jobs and opportunities we have will go with default assumptions like those and will go with the “safer pick” the person who doesn’t specify that or the one who doesn’t have that info readily available on tik tok youtube insta Facebook.

I don’t feel any better though. Well of course not nothing has actually changed. I have been taking Lamictal but not feeling any positive effects yet. I had been told for years it’s depression anxiety and one doctor said it sounded hormonal. I thought that I would get better. I thought that I would recover and live a healthy normal life.

They say because I’ve never been hospitalised and I manage to hold down a job and maintain relationships I don’t need it. I get it but it hurts.

I’m so consumed by what’s going on in my head whether it’s good or bad. I’m going to have to go back to a less demanding job which breaks my heart and I feel if leave it will trigger an episode.

I've been getting 5-6 hours of sleep a night so I'm paying attention to it but not super concerned and was just wondering what other people do in this situation.

50326,"Just Diagnosed today Hi first post to this Sub. (If anything I say is not allowed please let me know in a message even if you do remove the post so I can be more mindful in the future)Kinda nervous moving forward but today I finally went to a Psych and after about an hour of talking about different thing's she settled upon one sure for diagnoses of BP2 and immediately prescribed Latuda 20mg at night during dinner. I had spoken with a therapist years ago and was on Trintellix and also tried Zoloft which did nothing but give me headaches and the other made me rage out (respectively). I found out many of the things I do in my daily life are actually Symptoms of both Mania and Depression and that I'm going through episodes of both Multiple times a day for the past 4 years that we covered.I also have Chrons disease and I saw how it can affect weight and appetite so I'm hopeful it can boost that as well as get my Racing thoughts Insomnia and Hyper Productivity to a normal/manageable level. Im very leery about taking it with the experiences I've had with antipsychotics in the past but my Dr also works with my wife who is ADHD and BP2 and I've seen how our Dr has helped her by listening to her and not just her diagnosis.I'm on a Month trial at the 20mg so hopefully no severe side effects or medication interactions and this does what it needs to. And I apologize ahead of time to those on this Sub I will most likely be spam reading a lot of your posts in the coming days just to understand different perspectives of this cause I won't say I love it but I have a special thing about researching all I can about new things especially medical. Thank you all in advance",Bipolar
50327,"Psychiatrist belittling me First time poster on this sub but I feel like I need support. Sorry for the format I am on mobile. I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist but he doesn't seem to care.What really grinded my gears though was him saying ""well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6 I mean more like 2."" To which I had to tell him that no I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. To which he asks me ""well how did that change over the course of time?"" It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster. I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time and I just want to be taken seriously. I see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed; ""it's all in your head"" or ""that's just normal for a woman to be moody"" Have any of you ever had this happen on your journeys to getting help with your diagnosis/treatments? I want to know I'm not alone...",Bipolar

50329,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II yesterday. I guess it's my life now. Hey everyone I (18M) have had a mental illness all my life. That being ADHD. I was on Medication for it for about eight years until last year when I began to feel... different.My ADHD used to consist of hyperfixation hyperactivity and inability to concentrate- so normal ADHD stuff but last year before I graduated high school in May I noticed something was changing. I assumed it was my ADHD just evolving with new symptoms as I got older but towards Graduation time and shortly thereafter I realized I was wrong. It began to get worse with huge depressive episodes I would cry or feeling like crying some days and be fine the next. And I would feel worthless like I didn't mean or contribute anything and then have confidence that soared through the roof. I started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. The anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. I work retail and I've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment and then I'm super happy and energetic the next second. Even outside of work I snap at my parents my best friend and have constant negative emotions. I have started talking super-super fast without realizing and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. (MY Psych mentioned this to me yesterday). One of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. One thing I lack is impulse control I know something is wrong but I still choose to do it anyway. This has affected me with porn gaming too much and most importantly- spending. I have credit cards and I paid them off a month ago and once again I have a huge balance on both because I know I shouldnt be spending money but in the moment it feels like I should. Also the lack of motivation issue is *huge*. I want to go to the gym I want to go out and do things but I just *can't* no matter how hard I force myself to try.After an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong I came clean and told her that I've been keeping how I've been feeling from her my dad sisters and my psychiatrist and therapist. I was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. My psych told me that sometimes ADHD can evolve or even be mistaken for Bipolar since the two share similar symptoms. I was put on Latuda yesterday and I feel no difference yet since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so but I'm hopeful. And hopefully I can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.",Bipolar
50330,"The paranoia is killing me I feel so isolated and afraid. Things are turning crumbling. I feel like I can't turn to anyone. My psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long and in the day I have to be around so many people I can't tell what's going on for me. Some professionals even don't understand me unless they know me very well. I'm a serial masker and even when I'm wanting to throw a chair through a window I'll just casually say ""I'm raging right now"" and they don't take notice lol. So some professionals don't take notice and others say things like ""I'm very alarmed"" at my behaviour. I just can't be that person I used to be anymore; exploding rage and emotion. Luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible.I feel like everyone in society the world around me online is watching everything I'm saying and doing even people in cars or shop assistants. Which I know sounds ridiculous but I feel like I can't move a muscle or say a thing it's constant. It's even hard to post here.It was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now it's just hell. I made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and I won't sleep tonight. I got an exam today I'll see my nurse thankfully then my therapist but right now I just see this long stretch of night ahead of me. The house is so quiet I'm worried I'll see ghosts if I leave my room lol. I just feel so very alone.College helped so much they're very supportive there my classmates are amazing but it's getting confusing for me there too. My mouth is starting to get me in trouble. I feel like my world is getting smaller section by section. My psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a Buddhist centre for a few days as long as I don't drive there as long as I stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol. So maybe that will help me a lot.I don't even know what this post is about. It's just all crumbling down now. I might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone. Have something to eat and drink. Maybe try sleep again.I'm focusing so inwardly; thoughts feelings etc. I need to get out of my head and into my body. I try to do the mindfulness 5 things but I'm too paranoid about ghosts right now. I wanna listen to my headphones but can't for the same reason. I think I'm literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type and too paranoid to ring a hotline. I'm dreading 3 am but hopefully I will be asleep by then.I dunno maybe this post is an ask for someone out there to make me feel like I'm not one alien on an Earth full of humans lol.

50331,back on the med-go-round maybe? I recently did intake with a 'medication management clinic' because I wanted to renew the prescriptions my now-retired psychiatrist gave me but they informed me that two of the meds Ambien and Ativan they don't prescribe at all and Wellbutrin is not something they would let me take without an antipsychotic. Because I already have some samples from my old doctor I've been told to start Vraylar. After looking it up I am very hesitant to take it. I have a number of other medical and emotional issues having to do with weight gain and suicidal thoughts among other things and what I read has me worried. I just wanted a little help me out of the downturn rut I'm in and ease my anxiety and hypervigilance. I have my swings but haven't been hospitalized in 8 years basically since I stopped taking mood stabilizers (I tried a bunch of different ones in the last 15 years). This a clinic not a personal relationship like with all the p-docs before and I don't think the lengthy computerized questionnaire is set up to flag the nuances of my requirements like weight neutral or not mind numbing. I just want to comfortably exist in the world able to think clearly enough to get things done and without the paranoia edge that I live with now but if muscle jerks increased hospitalizations and diabetes are the price I have to pay maybe life as a hermetic loner is something I have to just accept.,Bipolar

I cannot even find the words to express how isolating it is trying to describe some of the symptoms to people. They try their best to relate but no one ever gets it. The struggles with time distortion between hypomania and depression. The cleaning and reorganizing because you feel like I'm doing so you have reinvented yourself. The countless abandoned hobbies picked up during a manic episode where you feel like you posess the ability to learn everything at a superhuman rate. The changes in how much sleep you need. Feeling like a different person snapping at people and regretting half of the decisions you've made. The suicidal thoughts. It's all so overwhelming but seeing that others are dealing with the same type of life and coping with it actually brought me to tears tonight. Thank y'all for sharing your experiences.

I was diagnosed 6-7 years ago with bipolar 1 and I’m still trying to figure it out. Been off and on with my meds. (Currently off with approval of psychiatrist) I’ve been trying to figure this out still. It’s hard but I’m still trying to figure out my mania. Right now I feel like I’m making risky choices.

I know I’ve heard and read many different things on mania and I know some people on the pages have struggled and this is why their marriages fail and I feel I’m at risk with mine but I miss this risk part which is why I think I want to play with fire?

50343,Bipolar and Relationships Has anyone else’s bipolar wrecked their relationship? I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features and I found out about it a year and a half ago. I also was also very recently diagnosed with C-PTSD due to an abusive childhood. I had a partner that I absolutely adored but after a huge life stressor I started to experience psychosis and paranoia and broke up with him because I strongly believed he was plotting against me and planning to hurt me. I then went through a series of depressive and manic episodes following the break up. When I finally got stabilized I reached out to him hoping to rekindle only to find out he had moved on with a girl who probably isn’t a complete psycho like I am. I wasn’t as good a girlfriend as I could’ve been either because of my unstable moods and lack of energy/ basic life skills/ girlfriend experience I wish I could do it all over again and just really show him how much I loved him. It just tears me up inside I miss him so much I’m sure he hates my guts. It honestly makes me want to stop living because I miss him so much.

(i’m 19 and still live with my parents) but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i don’t remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to “beat the fuck out of her” if she didn’t leave me alone. anyways because of that night i haven’t had any access to alcohol and i’m proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but i’ve been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now. but now that i’ve been good with that stuff i’ve become angry and i pick fights with whoever’s around me i get violent and suicidal thoughts and im at a point where i feel worthless. i don’t think my environment is helping me. i dropped out of college and i know my parents are disappointed in me. because of my mental health it’s been hard for me to get a job and now i have a part time in the mall and it’s a really good environment and very distracting. however my dad is on my case about how it’s not a real job and i’m pretty much useless in the house and i don’t contribute to anything. i want to respect him and do more but it’s hard to be in a house where everyone is depressed and projects their issues. my mother is also bipolar but is always giving me advice she can’t take. i know it’s not easy having a kid who’s bipolar but it seems like they don’t even try to understand me. everyday i wake up and feel so stuck. i feel like i don’t have a place here. even my hardest isn’t enough. i don’t want to be here anymore. im tired and angry. i have no interest in anything anymore other than sex and work because it at least distracts me. also my cat too she’s the reason why i wake up every morning. other than that i have no interest in doing anything with my life. i don’t care about anything and i never have really. i’m tired but here i am at 2 in the morning unable to sleep because i’m burdened by my thoughts.",Bipolar
50346,"Paradoxical cycle of my past present and future and suicidal ideation Hi guys So I am a bipolar and I haven't actually told anyone but few about my bipolarity. Anyway I believe being a bipolar affects the way I am thinking and the decisions I make according to my emotions which are instable and which will eventually lead to a feeling of regret and guilt later.So my problem is that now while the usual and frequent depressive episodes trigger this depressive episode is the WORST so far I live in this paradoxical loop and cycle between my past and all these nostalgic moments I am always recalling in my mind that could make me sometimes happy but also crying because I miss these moments so much and miss the people that I don't see anymore but have been a great part in my life nevertheless left me for either no reason or with a reason that I couldn't really do anything about it my present which is affected negatively by my nostalgia and emotions for the past and taking a great amount of time just living in the memories living in the past and dreams instead of living in the present time and my future which l do think about but don't care about it anymore sometimes I used to think about my future to forget about the past but failed to do so. Thinking about what I could do in the future makes me a bit happy nevertheless when these nostalgic moments hit me it just converts me from a happy person to a sad desperate and disappointed person again that eventually lead to deep depression which cause suicidal ideation mostly to overdose to death but ends up with failed attempts to commit suicide. I can't even determine if these memories are good or bad by now cuz it depends as well sometimes I just get the good parts of the memories while other times I just get the tragic parts and events that happened to me as for getting bullied recently at the university losing my best friend losing my boyfriend ...etc. I just believe by now that good memories are even worse and more hurtful than the bad ones. It just feels like getting stabbed in the back.These many emotions and mixed-up thoughts I get give me a headache and usually panic attacks that sometimes I cut myself with a nearby sharp thing as well.I also have ADHD social phobia and severe trust issues.

But fuck me does the depression hit me like a ton of bricks. It's more physical than mental at first. My limbs get heavy. I have zero energy to get up and do simple things. I procrastinate. Skip a few meals. Not brush my teeth. Leave a chore that needs doing. Then in a few days I'll feel all the mental affects coming in. If I'm lucky I'll just be comatose for a month. But if a mixed state comes along then it's panic attacks anxiety despair and suicidal ideation. Fingers crossed it's just depression.The hypomania was alright this time around. I have spent a bit too much worked a bit too hard overshared a bit too much socialised a bit too much. But no real damage this time. It was intense but kind of pleasant. But I can feel the dip is going to be huge. This is anecdotal but it feels like if my mania is under control (no psychosis and no mixed state) the depression part is deeper. Feel kind of quietly melancholic on an epic scale. If that makes any sense.It's going to be a slog for the next month. I should be happy I've got things under control I suppose. Anyone else want to share their experiences coming out of mania? It would make me feel better to hear others going through and surviving similar.",Bipolar

No one blames themselves for their kid dying of cancer. People have so much compassion and sympathy for people with cancer.

Why does someone's pain have to be cosmetically obvious for people to care or even believe it's real?I talked about this with my mom who barely survived her own cancer and she agreed with me without hesitation.

50368,"Rant but not reallynewly diagnosed but then again I’m not Hello all I’m new here but I feel like I shouldn’t be lol Yesterday was kind of a mental health day as I was talking to a social worker who was helping me find a new therapist. Long story short we got into my previous diagnosis’ and I told her mild depression adhd and anxiety. Yes these are true but however the one that is relevant to this post that popped up that I didn’t know was bipolar. I end up contacting my previous psychiatrist because I did not recall him saying this ( I swear he didn’t ) and he said yes but it is unspecified. He diagnosed me because of my constant irritability and made a point to say today I may be in remission because I wasn’t as snappy as before. I honestly Just thought the things he would say would rub me the wrong way. Next week he’ll do a full evaluation. A few years back another therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder I forgot which but I remember her say something of me being manic. I honestly don’t think she’s working anymore but I wanted this evaluation at the time because I believed I was bipolar starting around 13-16 years old. I had my reasons for it. Fast forward to last year my last psychologist said I was misdiagnosed and it was just adhd/add. I had mentioned my sex drive/hyper sexuality (which I may speak on in another post) my impulsive urges to do things mood swings that can be intense etc etc she said it was just a mixture of my depression and adhd. So now here I am and thinking back to the things I’ve done before and do now. These things I am trying to control and make sense of mainly the hyper sexuality I started to wonder if I was just a sex addict because of my habits and started looking into help to stop these things but yet my only problem is when I’m in the mood lol. I’m at a point in life where I want a second opinion or I just don’t want to believe or say I am even though I have the signs more than I’ve even mentioned.",Bipolar

50370,Trying to fix all the damage I caused Long story short I was diagnosed with depression back in 2021 after a rough year and 2 failed suicide attempts December 2021. Physically and mentally I made a full recovery by May 2022 my ex of 7 years cheated on me in June and I surprisingly dealt with it really well. I’d been off work March-September due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again I dealt with it well. I returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the office. I’m a confident bloke but I was nervous AF! I spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me fast forward a few hours later and she’d requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting. We met shortly after for a date and it was like we’d know each other years best date ever. From this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally. The connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal. I asked her to be my girlfriend in October and she was genuinely excited about it this made me realise I’d found someone special. Shortly after this I had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till January she was my rock my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. I’m 29 and I’ve cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term. I thought I was incapable but this woman changed that and she’s the first I’ve ever loved and hopefully the last. On 02/01/23 the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news. From this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably nothing too rapid. 05/01/23 I went over to my Nan’s house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day. I walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor this was the day I deteriorated rapidly. I needed my girlfriend desperately for support but I was just far too much to deal with. I wasn’t just depressed this time it was different. I was awake 4-8 days regularly and would only sleep when I’d black out. I was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head. Because it was my girlfriend who had become distant I stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much I love her. She wasn’t leaving me she just needed space and I could cope on my own. 20/02/23 2 men tried to steal my car and I managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process. I was hit 11 times with a knuckle duster and 40+ times by the other bloke with just his fists. I was left with 4 skull fractures fractured orbital bone broken nose and broke jaw. I’m an ex professional Muay Thai fighter so I’m used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different although I now have slurred speech blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally. I started to have panic attacks and I was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis. Again I continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away shortly after this she ended things. She made the right decision because I was horrendous and I was dragging her down. This present day I’m on the mend now and I barely remember any of it the days all merged as one. It feels like someone else has been living/wrecking my life and last week I woke up and have been given it back. I’m now trying to fix all the damage I’ve caused I’ve lost most of my friends family and the love of my life. I’ll never give up on her but for now I can only love her from a distance. I hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but I also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before. I’ve spoke to numerous Dr’s in and outside the hospital but have just been dismissed as I struggle explaining it and play it down. Thanks in advance and apologies for the long read,Bipolar
50371,Do you swallow your pills one by one or all at once? I’ve always taken them all at once along with my multivitamin and didn’t know so many people took them one by one.

50373,"Chicken or the egg? discussion! Hi everyone! I have a question that has been occupying my mind for a long time and I hope that this will spark a discussion and we can get deeper into understanding bipolar and find some answers. Maybe some of you are wondering the same.The question: mostly during manic episodes when my mind is racing at an alarming pace I wonder if this is all caused after all by external factors that make me stressed out OR by the bipolar itself so from within. Like I'm starting to stress out because a situation occurs that is out of my control: turmoil in a relationship some annoying interactions things at work etc. Or I start stressing out because of a shift towards manic? This is where I'm lost: at times I think that because of the diagnosis I overthink the stress and anxious feelings; knowing and convinced about my diagnosis i fully inserted bipolar behavior into my own identity and it informs my actions? But we don't live in a sterile bubble life is life and always something is happening.For context: during my manic state I start pacing mind racing increaced heart rate twitches and intrusive thoughts. I start walking fast through streets almost running away from this and I end up looking into passerbys eyes and then it's as if I'm being thrown into their lives as if I live through their experience I imagine how they act what happened in their childhood flashes into their daily routine interactions frustrations and happiness. And then I look at a window on some far away building start imagining and experiencing the life of another person in a similar way. Then I get thrown back into my body into reality and become more overwhelmed. Then it's my own memories of the past then imagining my own future and so on. The experience is intense and doesn't stop. When it wears off eventually I regain focus calm and ability to think clearer. Happens periodically about every few months and lasts usually about a week maybe 2(depending how I deal with it after the peak. It's not the most intense that happened but I don't wanna go in even more details because this is already TL;DR Edit: I have been diagnosed by 4different doctors on 4 separate occasions and rejected that idea for about 7 years until it became too unbearable and I was legit worried that this time I'm definitely not making it through.

50377,"I need a support system and I'm scared of myself I'm 30F. Been diagnosed since I was 14. By SEVERAL doctors. My parents never ""agreed"" (as if there's something to agree on a medical diagnosis) so I was unmedicated for most of my life so far. This gave me a lot of time to figure when a phase was coming what triggers it but also a lot of time to do stuff I shouldn't which hindered me greatly. Because of that I only started living on my own when I was 24 and that's when I started medication. To help with all this I have PCOS (which triggers depression) and long periods (which trigger anemia) so when I get my period I get depressive episodes AND I am physically exhausted and depleted. Which causes me to sleep more which causes me to go further into depression. My bf does his best to understand but it's all a bit beyond his grasp. My parents still don't recognize my situation so they are of no support for me. I don't have many friends and only one of them is actually supportive but she has a rough life and is usually busy with lots of work or something similar. So I'm on my own. I want to straighten up my sleep schedules but I know I can only do that by decreasing the amount of sleep drastically which will trigger a maniac episode. It's mostly mixed not generally full blown mania but it does get there sometimes and it's like a kinder egg you only know what you got when you open the box.

I’m mostly taking care of the kitchen and all food related things for the household.I’m just resting a whole hell of a lot more than I want to. I’m wasting away my day with nothing good to show for it. Probably 50% of the time I’m awake I’m in bed or sitting somewhere comfortable doom scrolling. I need to provide income so we’re not so tight on money. After consulting the hive mind of my friends and family everyone and myself have concluded that I need to start a business. I have an idea I’d like to track down but I can’t get going. It’s become an extended issue. I just can’t get going.I have a tharapist I love and I can’t decide if I need to see her more often to work on this. Or if I need to go to occupational tharapy. I’ve done occupational tharapy in the past and found if useful but I’m not convinced it would be a second time.I’ve met my deductible so more tharapy with my regular tharapist is free. Tharapy with occupational I’d have to find in network. I live in a rural area so unless I can get virtual from the metro in my state it might be difficult to find something that’s covered…",Bipolar
50402,"I feel like I'm subtly giving up and I can't stop Background: I'm bipolar 2. I'm a 42 year old man. In addition to the bipolar I'm autistic and have been severely abused throughout my life. My wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. I'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. I blamed myself but it doesn't change anything. She also left me with both of our kids who I love a lot they're 10 and 15. We've decided to slow date again and see if we can actually be together but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. Yeah I know it's a really bad sign but I have to try for me.Now: I can't stop sobbing all the time. Like hard hurt sobbing. I'm in therapy and I'm on meds. I'm not actively suicidal but I am starting to worry that I might be slipping into a suicidal trance. I think about it daily and I keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it. I don't really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage there's a lot there and a LOT of people would tell me don't give her a second chance including my 15 year old. I feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm she's caused me. But let's get back on subject. Today when I was signing out of work on Slack I typed ""Bye"" to my boss unconsciously I've never done that before it's always been ""See you Monday"" or something else. I held my 3 cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them. I wandered around the house (I work from home) after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room. I don't know what my brain is trying to get me ready for but I'm scared of myself right now. I can't really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward I might lose custody of the kids because of it even though they've both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left. So here I am. I don't know what is happening I'm scared and I have no where to really turn at the moment.",Bipolar

50406,Recently diagnosed 24yoF. I was recently diagnosed this past December. Bipolar (and other mental illnesses) runs genetically on my mothers side of the family (i didn’t get to know my mom she died) her sister is bipolar but she is a very heavy meth addict so i dont really go to her for advice or support. My dad is one of those people that don’t believe in a mental illness. My doctor has given me a low dose Seroquel/cymbalta combo and it does help 75% of the time. I also started a new job i used to be a medical assistant but i honestly think it made my condition so much worse. I think i always showed signs of being bipolar but never recognized them. But when i was a medical assistant i think it made me so much worse. I’m here because is anyone else’s mania miserable? When I’m manic it’s like I’m so overwhelmed with adrenaline. I cant sleep extreme irritation/rage and horrible anxiety. How have you learned to tell the difference between how you actually truly feel and when your being irrational? Is it possible to have a successful/stable relationship when your bipolar? Sometimes i just feel like when my feelings are so strong and intense i am such a toxic person and it’s gross and i want to fix it.,Bipolar
50407,What kind of therapy do you do? I haven't had a therapist for a while because I felt like it wasn't working for me. I am very self aware which just seems to make it difficult. I can describe my feelings and thoughts well so they don't understand why I'm struggling. It's like just because I can articulate it or locate the source of the problem doesn't mean I'm actually working through it. Does anyone else have this problem? I feel like I haven't found a therapist that really gets it yet so I barely make any progress.,Bipolar
50408,"Losing friends over diagnosis? Just semi recently some people who I considered long time friends and I truly believe it’s because I was being more open about my diagnosis. For context they has DID and alters and I tried to accommodate for them as much as I could. Yet they randomly removed me after we spent a few weeks together (it was a visit) I don’t really know what went wrong as I took my meds and I have a passive nature in general. No manic outbursts or emotional ones at all. We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities. But as soon as I got home one of them just didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. And I truly believe it was discriminatory behavior because I would bring up my diagnosis/ make jokes of because they would do the same. (Making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way) It took me bit to collect myself but I’m doing a whole lot better with therapy now that they’re not in my life anymore. They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional. Has anyone else here ever lost close friends that backstabbed you over your diagnosis? Or is it better for people with this disease to just keep everyone at arms length and give the cold shoulder out of fear of discrimination or assumptions on what they think bipolar is? Most people don’t judge by the content of your character anymore and it’s so incredibly sad it has to be that way",Bipolar

I’m turning 40 in a few months so I’ve suffered/lived/almost died/laughed through this illness for over 2 decades. I have a friend who I will call Amy. Amy was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety after a stressful life event. Amy knows about my diagnoses and we are very close so she has turned to me for questions and emotional support. I love Amy. I want to support Amy the best I can. But the amount of emotional support she is asking for is starting to drain my own mental health resources for staying stable. Additionally Amy makes a lot of comments about our experiences being the same and she “gets what’s it’s like for me now” when she very clearly does not. She is not making these comments from a place of ill intentions. I know mental illness is not a contest and mental health treatment is important for everyone. However I have started to internalize it as “Amy is downplaying everything I’ve been through.” Does anyone have any advice on how I can support Amy while protecting your own mental health?,Bipolar

Despite taking meds religiously all these years and trying so many different combos I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things.

50443,Dealing with this condition. Hello everyone! This is my first time posting in this group. I was diagnosed with bp2 after struggling for years with depression and supposedly mania also. But I was also diagnosed with adhd a little over a month ago. Both felt like I was diagnosed relatively quickly. Idk if that’s a good or bad thing. My depression has always been bad especially in my teens but my best friend died of suicide when I was 18 and it got worse from there. Im currently 21 and have no will or desire to pretty much live( not suicidal I think) life just seems pointless when im always depressed I have zero motivation to do anything. Im in therapy but it feels like it’s not helping. I was recently put on vyvanse to help with my supposed adhd diagnosis. It’s helped with my motivation a little but hasnt really done much. And every anti depressant/psychotic has either made me worse or done the bare minimum which is keeping me alive. Ive been on 5+ different medications since my bp2 diagnosis 2 years ago. Ive had maybe 2 or 3 hypo manic phases since my diagnosis but their never anything more than a day or 2 of euphoria and more motivation and a splash of poor impulsive decision making. I don’t really know where I’m going with this other than how the fuck do you guys deal with this? My lifes been at a complete stand still since I was around 16-17. I have no diploma no job and not a single desire to pretty much be a human at this point. Sorry for the long post I just figured I’d give an insight to what life is for me.

50448,"How do you deal with your past? I dated an undiagnosed bipolar 1 while I was an undiagnosed bipolar 2. We met on a mania in our early 20s. I’m sure many of you can imagine the drugs and “fun” we had on our high. I ended up pregnant. He came down hard and I started having suicidal thoughts from all the drama being bipolar entails. I had an abortion. It was the abortion or drive off a bridge. Even his catholic family had choice words for me that made me feel all the more trapped.I cleaned up and went back to college and started traveling more. He went to rehab 2ce. I wrote him while in rehab the 2nd time. He was kicked out of rehab for acting on his hyper-sexuality. Him and the lady became a couple and had a daughter. I leave him alone because now he’s diagnosed and I took a few college courses to educate myself on mental illness. I knew he wasn’t in full control. He would call me from fake numbers in the middle of the night and we’d talk never meeting up. His lady caught on and would call and confront me. I sent her receipts that it’s him after me. Eventually he stopped contacting me knowing I’d snitch.It’s been 8 years and I’m now diagnosed and medicated myself. I recently had my own daughter. I’ve been thinking about him and looked him up. He reached out to me 2 years ago right before I was diagnosed and I responded with his arrest record.As I’m looking into him I find out he was in a coma from going in to cardiac arrest. He’s learning to walk talk and move his hands again. It looks like he lost a finger. His family hasn’t posted any information about how or why. Also my daughter has the same name as his mom totally forgot his moms name and my spouse picked the name.I’m in this fog of wanting to reach out but also why? We are living separate lives. It’s been almost a decade! I questioned if it was real love or the mania for so long..My spouse and father of my daughter is a good guy. He’s stable and loving. He isn’t jealous and we have talked about the ex in the past. We have agreed that we chose each other and not the ex’s. However he will never understand what not being in full control is like.It’s how I ended up on this sub. Looking to see if I was as crazy as I felt. Looking for similar experiences and stories and boy did I find my community. Just looking to get this off my chest; and for y’all’s 2 cents and experiences.",Bipolar

Earlier I had been throwing a toy for my dog but stopped because my energy felt so low. As I was lying there she kept nipping at my heels and barking when I told her to stop. Finally my anger boiled over and I yelled at her. I said awful things to her that I don’t want to repeat even to strangers on the internet. I put her in her crate and went to the bathroom to take a bath and calm down. I feel so awful about it and I hate feeling like this and hurting others.

50459,"I got a stern reminder that being stable doesn’t mean I am cured I recently had to lower my lithium (under doctor supervision) because my lithium level was too high. I started to notice that I felt less numb. I felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm fuzzy happy for the first time since I was a teenager. It was intoxicating. So I thought to myself maybe I don’t need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad plan…For the last few days I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. Back on my lithium… I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be “sedated” to some degree. I shouldn’t complain because at least I have stability. But that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing I will never have it has left me in a bad way. I feel ungrateful for the stability I have and greedy for the way I used to feel before getting sick.

50460,"Being bi polar and no one understands you I was diagnosed 6 years ago with type 2 bi polar disorder and my God what a fucking battle it has been from being on various medications at first to being on/off with meds to being stable on meds and now eventually being off my meds.Having this disorder is just too indescribable and majority of the people I've come across don't understand it especially those close to me which is pretty fucked up. The constant questions of ""what's wrong with you"" to ""why are you like this""When I try to explain to my family members that I have a disorder they turn around and say ""don't speak that over your life."" Like tf? (They quite religious)Half the time I have no reason to feel how I feel and I control my impulses my moods and my outbursts to seem normal to the world but its soooooo draining to feel like one day you on top of the world and life is great and then the next few days you feel like a piece of shit who doesn't deserve anything good. I guess thats just joys of not being on meds but even being on meds I still had to control it there was better periods of stability but there was moments of is this shit working?The episodes that come whether depressive or manic unfortunately it seems as if my family doesn't believe it and it's all in my head...excuse the pun there but its really fucked up. Having this disorder has messed with my life in ways I couldn't imagine and in the past I didn't know its coz I'm mentally ill I just thought this is me being normal until I was diagnosed everything made sense as to why I am the way I am. My habits and my patterns my way of thinking.I've lost out on so much I've been through so much and the funny part is I have nothing to show for it like it's been a wasted life.

50461,"Something I wrote before I knew I was bipolar. I used to think it was a personality disorder instead of a mood disorder. Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way dear beloved and most precious electronic journal I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings nonetheless.How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much but baring mental health professionals I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that of course is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.I have messy hair messy eyes my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!) I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job we call it work because you do motions in a job but we call the motions “work” because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing- but you know that feeling you get in your chin your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions to me seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e. anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die looking at places where you could hang yourself feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing imagining a knife to the throat thinking about swerving into traffic travelling and not feeling anything kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything doubting everything you do every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs anxiety is depression anxiety is the antithesis of life of enjoyment of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety” as this is obviously a corrupted poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e. anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

And part of All County band programs(a hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people). I then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college I however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years performing for presidential speeches Veterans day and St.Patrick day parades in NYC played half time shows at NFL games etc. I used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me sure I wasn't the best in the world but the raw emotion I put into my music was just a feeling I can't even explain now it's been over 4 years since I've touched sn instrument and I just feel so empty about it.

My cat would never forgive me and I do enjoy being alive even when it's chaotic and kinda terrible.I have basically been rapid cycling the past 11 months with a few intermittent bigger episodes dealing with a very fresh PTSD development due to being in an abusive relationship with someone who in a psychotic rage beat a woman so bad he caved in part of her skull. He's in prison now but it doesn't erase the damage done to her or me.I had 6 months med access instability 1.5 years of job instability housing environment instability other health problems (ever tried to use your hands when you can't feel 80+ percent of them?) and these god damn hallucinations and crying spells really need to fking stop.I've been trying out more meds different med combos self-care coping mechanisms.

I wrote down my important login information. I've been talking to my dad and my sister about the gist of everything.

I'm hoping to fill my meds as soon as my insurance lets me (up to 5 days before the days supply ends) so I can build up extra. Maybe try to get a vacation override or something towards the end. I'm gonna work some extra shifts to build up some money. I gotta get Annie to the the vet for her annual exam and refills of her phenobarbital. And ask the vet if she will authorize an early refill or prescribe a larger volume so there's more of a buffer zone for her (because her seizures are both heartbreaking and terrifying at the same time).I have so much to do!

I could’ve really hurt someone or even gotten myself killed. Now anytime I’m in a good mood I start panicking and crying thinking it’s coming back. That was my first manic episode and I was on a lot of Cymbalta during it. I also wasn’t officially diagnosed until after the fact.

50555,"Are things going to get any better? So... I usually don't post anything on Reddit but here we go.About eight months ago I was diagnosed with BP2. I've struggled with mental health issues all my life (anxiety depression) and developed PTSD at a pretty young age. After a few years of fluctuating emotions I went to see a psychologist and I got my diagnosis. I was also diagnosed with asperger's syndrome back in 2019.I've been on a mood stabilizer (lamictal) since I was diagnosed and it's made things easier for me but exam season (last year of high school) is coming up and I lowkey feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm experiencing mixed moods every other week I can't really sleep anymore and every day I'm torn between ignoring everyone around me freaking out or acting friendly because I know I shouldn't take my own mental illness out on anyone. I'm either tired stressed occasionally productive or filled with a kind of self-loathing and sadness that I can't even begin to describe. I'm worried I'll be thrown straight into a depressive episode soon because stress is my biggest trigger. Very few people (two of my friends and my immediate family) know that I'm bipolar and I don't even want to tell **them** about how I feel right now. I think a lot of people on here can relate to that crushing feeling that you're a burden to your loved ones even when they tell you you're not. I considered the possibility that things might get better if I told someone but I just don't have the energy and I don't want to let people in because I'm ashamed that I'm losing control. Explaining how I feel to someone is difficult (asperger's yay) and there aren't many people I trust with my emotions. The people I trust are the ones I don't want to burden.I wanted to ask does it get any easier? Not to board the self-pity train or anything but I'm not even 20 and thinking about the future terrifies me. I don't want to fall apart and fake that I'm okay every time a problem arises. I don't want to isolate myself because I'm scared of affecting people. I don't want to experience all these episodes over and over again.

50558,"How bad does it have to be to be considered psychosis? I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.However I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were retrospectively pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100% unquestioningly and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks (although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway) and then fought with all my family and friends about it.At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. (I really was sick though but the level of paranoia was weird).I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant; until recently I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.TLDR; at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs ""being paranoid and having weird thoughts""?I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff and I can't tell if for me it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first.

I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. I have mixed feelings I’ve known that this was most likely the answer but I didn’t want it to be true.

50621,Newly diagnosed I got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 three days ago and have already been diagnosed with anxiety and autism. I don't know where to start. I am relieved because my mother thought I was having hormonal changes or I was exaggerating but my father actually tried to help. Whenever I think of those moments being frustrated over my mother saying that I was using it as an excuse after I got diagnosed with anxiety it saddens me. I feel better because now she is more careful. What do I do know ? I have some coping methods like music physics math etc.,Bipolar

50624,"Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. Well my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right. I just wanted to share what I am going through because 1. support would be nice. and 2. if anyone else is going through this you aren't alone.",Bipolar
50625,"Do you also do this during hypomanic (mixed?) episodes? TLDR : I'm bipolar type two with mixed features currently in a hypomanic (mixed?) episode.I experience some of these things:- clenched jaw- 10-15 minute panic attack that disappears in a few seconds leaving you confused but not feeling bad (just very confused)- nightmares and night sweating- completely forgetting to eat and losing the instinct of eating or liking food except shit like sweets cola coffee and chips (with cigs ofc)Do you?Note : I'm like 95% sure I'm hypomanic right now and have been for almost a month but was in denial until a week ago seeing psychiatrist on Friday to talk. Anyway I'm experiencing these things and was wondering if anyone else had this: - clenched jaw most of the time- random 10-15 minute panic attack/dark dissociation (few times a week had one where i couldn't contain a scream that was just so guttural like I was giving birth and then started hyperventilating so hard I almost fainted and had to sit down and hold onto something to not fall) but then all of a sudden you have a posotive thought and it disappearears in a second making you wonder what even happened and laughing at how dramatic you are- nightmares or night sweating- completely FORGETTING TO EAT like losing the instinct to eat even when I'm hungry I don't think about food but I think of resolving the problem so I stuff myself with the easiest fastest food that's kinda nutritious and idc about the taste like plain slices of protein bread Bananas (I don't even like the texture or the taste of bananas but its the cleanest and most efficient for hunger) vegan pre-made protein shakes in bottles (over 2 months I've consumed about ~100 of them I have one every morning and other shit ""meal"" mentioned above) and SOMETIMES have the patience to boil a pack of ravioli that takes 3 minutes to cook and eat it just with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or airfry in 10 minutes a pack of vegan nuggets or fish sticks and eat them plain yup no sauce and not evem fried such a treat (less dishes). Btw I'm also diagnosed with mixed episodes and I've experienced them but usually they are way darker and cold with a bit of psychotic moments and I just feel superior to others like an evil God and I'm full of rage.Whereas here I feel quite at peace but a bit out of control but I know that I'm gonna take care of it soon (going back tomorrow to my parents). And overall I feel happy everyday and grateful and I feel like the world is so beautiful but I just have those breakdowns described above few times a week if not almost daily these days...Mmh yeah I talk a lot but that's a known hypimanic thing.

50626,"Bipolar doubt I was diagnosed with Bipolar last May after trying to kill myself and did seven nights in a pysc ward which did me so much good.For awhile before my diagnosis I had talked to my doc about ADHD cause I felt I fitted the symptoms of that so was in shock when I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar. When on what I call highs I get extremely productive. I get so much done and take up new hobbies that never last more than a couple of months. My lows are never so bad I'm depressed but I have no energy mentally or physically and no interest in doing anything and I fall behind on everything. The house gets messy and I struggle to achieve anything.I have 3 kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy. I'm snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and I get into moods because everything in the house is messy again. It's like a vicious circle. My lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods.But sometimes when I read what other people go through and mine doesn't seem so bad in comparison I start to doubt I even have Bipolar. These thoughts sneak into my head I feel like an imposter and that I'm not really as bad as I think and I'm only lazy subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit.Are these thoughts normal? I feel so guilty with myself then and it makes my anxiety even worse?",Bipolar
50627,Do your episodes result in physical health problems? I've been battling bipolar for about about 8 years and just recently diagnosed and medicated in the past year and a half. Every episode I have results in my thyroid swelling up as a reaction to stress (like so big the endocrinologist gasped when he saw it) I have a whole bunch of nodules on my thyroid and now instead of the thyroid swelling up it's the nodules that are filling with fluid and swelling up....only when I'm at the end of an episode so I know it's due to stress and the endocrinologist agrees. I've also experienced SIBO and I still do if I don't follow a strict diet I became allergic to fragrance coconut on skin and Aloe Vera all out of nowhere and my hair was falling out this all happened when I was unmedicated undiagnosed and extremely stressed out and my anxiety was through the roof.

I feel euphoric- hitting the gym banging out a bunch of projects at work trying to buy a house all of a sudden (even though my lease doesn’t end til November) having sex with my husband every day. But in the back of my mind I’m constantly worried this could spiral into a full blown manic episode. This is the first time since last summer I’ve actually felt GOOD.

Ive no idea what world I’ve entered into mostly because I don’t understand much yet despite wanting to. I’ve studied psychology at university before dropping out (multiple times) and it’s so easy to look at things on the outside and understand them but to look introspectively is so difficult.

It’s difficult to place or recognise moments of irritability excitement etc. Sometimes I’m panicking without even knowing I’m panicking or why. Im just very much in a state of barely knowing what’s going on in my head until the aftermath unless it’s depressive thoughts those are pretty easy to figure out and by far the most common for me.

50648,"Switching meds planning pregnancy and moving across country. Recipe for disaster? For context I have type one and a history of 4 hospitalisations in 7 years. ECT (worked amazingly but only for a while) tried loads of medications and it seems like we've finally found a combo that works. I haven't had a serious episode for over two years now. I have a two year old son and despite the manic episode I had after four days is labour when he was born he's the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health. I love him to bits even though he was a surprise and I was totally sure I wasn't ready.Now my husband and I want a sibling for him. We both never had siblings of our own so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings. We want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger. 3 years difference is ok but 4 seems like much more to me. I don't know. I've started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in May. We also happen to be moving across the UK for my husband's work in July. If all goes well I could be pregnant by then.I told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant clomipramine is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects. He wants to switch me to an SSRI (citalopram) which I've tried several of and they haven't done much for me in the past. Clomipramine worked for me I think because it's also effective in OCD and while I don't have OCD my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. I've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode I had a year ago and since I haven't had any depression at all and I haven't gone manic either.I'm just worried with the move (even though I'm really looking forward to it) and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. As a mother I feel having a serious episode is not an option but then am I just putting more pressure on myself? Is this crazy? Should I try it or wait another year with the baby?
