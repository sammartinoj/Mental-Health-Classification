# text_tools_project

## Topic
**Mental Health Classifier**

This project will use preprocessing to clean our data (lowercase, strip whitespace, ensure no random numbers/characters appear). We will also capture type/token ratios and possibly part of speech classes in our data. 

## Navigating the Repo

In the data folder, you will find cleaned-output, which is the data we used for all downstream tasks.

In the stats folder, you will find a few scripts and a directory for calculating interesting statistics about the data. pos contains the following scripts and files: tagger.py tags the mini-csvs using thespacy tagger. pos-stats.sh generates POS tags for the CSVs. pos_count



The scripts used to create cleaned-output can be found in the folder called preprocessing. This folder contains scripts for both cleaning and creating the mini-csvs.

The directory called pos contains a few scripts and files. tagger.py tags the mini-csvs. pos-stats.sh generates POS tags for the CSVs. pos_count.txt contains the POS counts generated by pos-stats.sh.
