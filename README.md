# text_tools_project

## Topic
**Mental Health Classifier**

This project will use preprocessing to clean our data (lowercase, strip whitespace, ensure no random numbers/characters appear). We will also capture type/token ratios and possibly part of speech classes in our data. 

## Navigating the Repo

In the data folder, you will find cleaned-output, the data we cleanedand trained our classifier with.

The scripts used to create cleaned-output can be found in the folder called preprocessing. This folder contains scripts for both cleaning and sorting.
