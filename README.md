# text_tools_project

## Topic
**Mental Health Classifier**

This project will use preprocessing to clean our data (lowercase, strip whitespace, ensure no random numbers/characters appear). We will also capture type/token ratios and possibly part of speech classes in our data. 

## Navigating the Repo

### Data
In the data folder, you will find cleaned-output, which is the data we used for all downstream tasks. The scripts used to create cleaned-output can be found in the folder called preprocessing. This folder contains scripts for both cleaning and creating the mini-csvs

# Statistics
In the stats folder, you will find a few scripts and a directory for calculating interesting statistics about the data. pos contains the following scripts and files:
1) tagger.py, which tags the mini-csvs using thespacy tagger.
2) pos-stats.sh, which generates POS tags for the CSVs.
3) pos_count.txt, which contains the POS counts generated by pos-stats.sh.
4) type-token.sh, which generates type token ratios for each mini CSV.
5) anygram directorys, which is contains all scripts for ngrams processing of each individual disorder files.
