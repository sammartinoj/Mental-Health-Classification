At the first sign of anxiety or depression traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved.

I feel WAY better than I used to and on a day to day basis things are great. Buttt every once in a while (A handful of times a year tops) something will realllly set me over the edge and send me into an intense anxiety spiral where I compulsively ask 5 or so different friends for advice on what to do post a lot of threads online about what I should do and ruminate on the topic for days or weeks. Sometimes I'll have chats in messenger about whatever it is that will draw out over an entire 3-4 hour period.,Normal

27534,I've been out of work for nine months and it's finally catching up to me. When I lost my job in January I took a sabbatical for a few months; it was necessary at the time. Hindsight being 20/20 I should have set up my phone with call blockers when the bill collectors began calling.

Sadly my body got habituated to the sleep-component of Mirtazapine after about five months and my old warped sleep cycle slowly creeped back into my life.

For the last few nights when I come back I've noticed a homeless person sleeping between the glass front at the ground floor entrance and the back of the stairwell... This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway.

She treats me as if I am a child who doesn't think things through on normal small decisions this is going to be a nightmare. A little information on my own thought process and my relationship. I am a very pragmatic person but also very independent.,Normal
27665,So long story short I’m currently a freshman and my mom has made it clear that I’m being kicked out before the start of my sophomore year. I plan on making my way to New York City and living on the streets while looking for a job under the table. I am hoping to find somebody willing to hire me for a construction//landscaping job. My goal is to save money while going to high school so that I can get my diploma and start a career in law enforcement. Of course my mom didn’t think to take note to save anything such as my birth certificate or the like...,Normal
27666,I tend not to like driving long distances in cars with people in unfamiliar places still but I feel good just that I am back on the road even if I don't drive the car. This took me about five years to reach this level of comfort. All of my fears: I started to exercise hard every single day. Heavy exercise would defeat the fear in most cases or make it easy to manage. If I did not exercise I was a walking fear bomb.,Normal
27668,Things with my foster parents were reaching a breaking point so I finally ran away from home. I've never gone back and never will go back. I'd rather die than go back into a cage. I skipped the last month of my college semester didn't bother going to the finals and just relaxed in the downtown area of the city I lived near. I still had my job so I was just relaxing and enjoying my newfound freedom.,Normal

27674,Oh I forgot Aversives. This is where the therapist is openly punitive hostile or withholding explicitly in order to punish and teach you. Linehan gives three sentences towards ant ethical criticism of this by saying it works. It also uses fun techniques like giving multiple sessions a week plus groups which are mandatory. There is also telephone contact.,Normal
27675,"They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures. She regularly says that she ""doesn't deserve"" someone as ""perfect"" as me (which yes she does she's amazing and also I'm not even that great just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that ""because of past experiences I have trouble liking people who I know like me... I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation."" In short it seems like because of her past relationships she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her). All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",Normal

27712,He's exactly what I've needed maintains his side of an equal partnership etc. My only problem is that though our sex life is great I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes even if he shows no interest that occasional day then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day. It's not like we never do anything I just seem to still be attached to this idea.

27715,Edit: She has seen a therapist that diagnosed her with PTSD based on a fear of tornadoes (that she has never been directly affected by other than her parent father having them go into a basement as one was nearby). I believe this to be a slight misdiagnosis and the focus of the treatment to be incorrect.

Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat” this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore.

Together we can create a collective voice in raising awareness and education on mental health!,Normal

Due to the unexpected costs of the move and the cost of getting settled into our new home we are severely in need of some basics to get us and our two pets through until we receive our first full checks from our new jobs.

So talked to my therapist about this and I had already told the DA I want him to see jail time not just 2 years of probation with state mandated drug treatment. isn't this also really awful as now they'll just forever say it was because of their addiction and never take full responsibility for their own actions?

27992,She'll order so much food and binges on it while downing shots the whole time. The way she orders food and drinks kinda makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her. It's like I'm binging too. She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging. The more recent time I hung out with her I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).,Normal

I was offered the position once before about a year and a half ago but I turned it down because I felt I wasn't ready.

The way that he put it he was saying that my husband wouldn't get physical from what he could tell but there are boundaries that he passed. Unfortunately he couldn't provide any examples because he couldn't remember what was said but he could remember the feeling that he had and it was disgust. This was during the holiday season when their company had an influx of new people and they would be gone within a few weeks because the work they do is very physical and not a lot of people can handle it.

She is now in terminal condition and the family is facing a staggering mountain of medical bills. The icing on the cake is that the onset of the strokes occured while Laney's mom was 8 month's pregnant. The last year and a half has been horrific.

Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman which was shocking to me because I trusted her and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community.

They're not the sort of jobs I would love to have \(I kind of want a job where I can talk to other people in the workplace\) but I found that social media/community manager gigs are so flexible and are working at home jobs.

I honestly dont think i can live long with this but i do care about her and want to do something back for her. I was pretty much done with my live and lost all fate and interest in things. She was the one that got me back on these things. And beside these moments i have a good time with her aswell.,Normal
28294,he was my best friend since highschool she was a girl i really liked. my parents let him live at my house when his parents kicked him out and he started dating the girl that i really liked behind my back. im not gonna go into too much detail about the drama but in short i kicked him out and they both hate me now. there were some not so nice comments going back and forth. the other day they moved into an apartment together after being together for like 3 months but i just found out through the same person who initially told me that they were dating his ex gf [22F] that he has hit her on several occasions.,Normal
28296,The next time I went to see her after that she said sorry if I wasn’t my self last time and I just said that she seemed tired and so I started to see her earlier in the day. Even from the first few time I went to see her she would always talk about herself. I didn’t have a problem with it because I am shy and so bad at conversation it kind of took the spot light off of me even tho that’s kinda what I was there to see her for. Also from the beginning she was kinda well very unprofessional and I knew this. I had just started to see a psychiatrist and I had told her what medications weren’t working for me so she gave me some of hers to try and see if they worked.,Normal
28297,For the record my partner hasn't brought this up as an issue but of course being turned down sucks and it's been like this since the beginning. I thought with time I'd relax but it wasn't a question of relaxing. To make things worse nine times out of ten that we do have sex is because I initiate. That is not because he never does that is how much I turn him down. I know this seems stupid since most posts here are about how to survive but maybe a random post about improvement can be acceptable?,Normal
28300,Well Reddit I don't even know where to begin... I guess I will start at the start of my relationship with my now wife and mother of my beautiful little girl. Our relationship came on suddenly and the surprise that is my daughter came on extremely surprisingly to me. I was already 36 years old and had been in several long term serious relationships that for one reason or another ended prior to marriage and I had long since just assumed I was incapable of fathering a child. I was years past all the stages of grief on the subject.,Normal

28304,It's not that the current one isn't helping at all but it would be nice if it helped _more_. She's got a lot of good literature and notes and it's helped some. But it's her words that it hasn't helped as much as she would like. Just wondering if anyone with any experience in talk therapy would share anything she may be able to talk about or focus on that could help a lot? This is a new experience for her so she might just not know what to do or say during therapy to get anywhere if the therapist isn't guiding the discussion and I wouldn't know what to suggest either.,Normal
28305,Hi I've posted it a lot on this sub constantly and I figured why don't I just submit a post with these steps. . This is how I deal with panic attacks/anxious intrusive thoughts. I hope that I am able to help you the way they have helped me.,Normal
28306,EVENT 1: &#x200B; My life was in a wretched state and I concluded that I have to find god with absolute certainty. I immediately perceived a being of infinite bliss within my mind that was alien to me. I confessed my 'sins' to this entity and repented of my behaviour.,Normal
28307,My wife (we've been together 8 years) however is determined to 'finish the job'. Her father taught her much of what she knows and that is certainly a factor as to why she is an constructual engineer... But unlike her father she isn't a certified electrician or plumber nor is she especially skilled at carpentry. The issue is that we live 5 hours away and even if we did go *every* weekend to work on the house it would take well over a year to even get it into a acceptable state let alone 'finished' and sellable. I brought up the idea of getting contractors to finish the house.,Normal
28310,I could easily see myself losing my job due to consolidation. In the meantime I have been wanting to leave this job anyway because I realized that I'm truly ready to move on from retail. I've had some promising leads but I found and a piece for a job that is at a lighting company that would combine the best of what I went to school for and my real world work experience. I got a call a few days ago but couldn't get an interview scheduled because during the call the hr lady got an email that the person I would interview with would be unavailable and I didn't have my work schedule right in front me so we decided to talk again the next day once we both had an idea of what the schedules for each side would be. Well the next day I called her and she still hadnt heard back from the person I would interview with and promised to call me the next day.,Normal
28312,She was unemployed and toyed with the idea of answering ads from strangers to perform fetish tasks for money to include nudity (but no sex). It really wrecked me that she would consider that. She brought it up once again not too long ago (not seriously) and I flipped out. She was working as a nanny for a long time and I was very insecure about her and her boss because of my fear that she would be willing to do sex work for money. Now she has never done any sex work for money and we agreed that it is not something I am comfortable with and she will not do it so that's not an issue.,Normal

28314,We're currently looking for separate houses haven't told the kids but my face is an absolute dogs dinner and will definitely have scarring for life. If it was the two of us we could work it through but my relationship with G after so many telling offs heart to hearts explanations about his actions and their consequences still goads me to get a rise. This is a woman who won't back down easily and will portray very intelligent coniving questions which have left me feeling dominated under control and manipulated for a couple of years now. The one guiding light for us to work through it is my younger two children and how much I adore them. Stillin this current situation there's is a seemingly insurmountable wall of emotions from all parties which would need a huge amount of effort to even bring us to the negotiating table.,Normal
28315,Well I've been on an anti-depressant now and I definitely feel less depressed and motivated but my anxiety has gotten slightly worse. I explained all my symptoms to the dr I saw today and expressed my concerns to her about taking benzos every day (family history of addiction and I find myself to have a very obsessive personality.) and she totally agreed with me and said I probably have GAD along with the depression. She added an anti-seizure med as a mood stabilizer and told me that should hopefully level out how I am feeling and take care of the anxiety that is probably being brought on by the anti-depressant. I am so happy that a dr actually listened to me.,Normal
28316,It is getting to a point where she can no longer work and is at risk of losing her home as well as her ability to get to her doctors so it is time to reach out and ask upon the kindness of others. She started a gofundme with more information about her issues and the steps that she has taken thus far to avoid asking for monetary donations (and is even offering trade for art) please take a look and consider donating. Anything (even just $5 so she has gas to get to the doctor) will help immensely and is literally life changing for her. Thanks for your time! <url>,Normal
28317,When I have a thought and that thought makes me feel good it is because that thought is true that thought is in alignment with my true nature according to my higher self\infinite intelligence that thought is correct it is the right way for me “define” myself and to go in life. When someone says to you “You are beautiful” “I love you” “I enjoy being around you” … That makes you feel good because those thoughts are TRUE those thoughts are showing you who you are you are loved you are beautiful you are and incredible person to be around with. (In my case I feel in heaven when someone says to me “You make me feel amazing” 🙂 ) The same goes with your on thoughts and perspectives (that’s what you attract every time btw) when you define yourself/think of yourself in a way that makes you feel good like “I feel worthy” “I love myself” “I love being me” “I truly like my new shirt” “I’m having so much fun” “I’m at peace and relaxed” you are going in the right way the right direction forward and aligned with your dreams and passions. From feeling fine to feeling ecstasy and Infinite Love it is true for you those thoughts and perspectives are the ones that will serve you in amazing ways and that will bring you the tremendous benefits for you and for your life keep choosing them believe in them bathe yourself in them.,Normal
28318,We were raised in the Bible belt and she believed every word they told her about it being normal. I tried so hard to explain it to her over the years. She never understood.

Can I get one that's already trained or how would we train one? We prefer to rescue animals instead of buying from breeders but how do we train?,Normal
28327,Hello wonderful world of Reddit! My boyfriend and I rescue animals in need. We'll Foster them for however long it takes to find them a home but this guy is something special and I think he's staying with us for good. His name is Chance and he was rescued by an acquaintance from some people who weren't caring for him properly and we're going to dump him somewhere. Then this acquaintance's leasing office told him it was him or the dog and so he was heading a shelter when I spoke up and took him in.,Normal
28329,Please Do not hate him. Yes he took her side so many times. You can say that he should have seen the signs or whatever but honestly no he couldnt have. He worked 14-16 hours a day (in las vegas heat that is no fucking joke of a day) to support his household. She would make sure I was tucked in bed by the time he got home and what little chances i got to see him he would have already heard from her I was horrible some way or another and have the impression i was trying to lie.,Normal

28364,As you can imagine people are not so charitable in this city but you'd be surprised people can be generous with what they let slide its easier than depending on pure charity. At best with this method you will find a series of short term places and you will probably get into at least 1 sketchy situation so always protect yourself and have a way out. If you haven't already hit up the DPSS. It will take an entire day but if you tell them you're homeless they will give you an EBT card that day.

28371,We had signed up for the boat ride (something she was extremely excited about) but the lines got a little backed up and the time got pushed back. An hour had passed of us at the event and we were scheduled to go on the boat ride in about 15 minutes. However since that hour had passed her boyfriend refused to stay any longer and made both of them go home even though she really wanted to go on the boat. These are some of the bigger events that have pissed me off; however they have the same fight everyday regarding their differing values and her wanting to do things/live her life and him refusing to make any sort of sacrifice or compromise to do that with her resulting in her just settling to the situation. Since graduation he accepted that crappy job and moved across the country taking her with him.,Normal

Long story short after about half a year of being unemployed due to panic attacks at work causing me to be miserable I am ~5 weeks back into a new job in a different field on an SSRI and feeling more or less great. As a result I've had some more time to focus on what actually triggers my anxiety rather than fighting off daily bouts of throwing up from panic.

28448,She is friends with a buddy of mine but her and I are not even facebook friends or anything we talked five or six times in these two years and never anything big just small talk. A few months after starting classes my buddy told me that Chloe has a crush on me and gave me the impression that she wanted me to be aware of this however even after that she didn’t try to talk to me or make herself noticed at all. She is a pretty girl the artsy kind that likes to travel read poetry and paint coincidentally the exact opposite of my girlfriend who has very different hobbies. Like I said I love Alice and I didn’t think much of it. Her avoidant behaviour hasn’t changed and I didn’t approach her either.,Normal

I would like to save up while doing this over the next couple of months get my finances back in order and pay monthly on a land owner finance piece of raw land without covenant restrictions at around $200 a month (that is a possibility in my area at about 2 acres) and get a tiny building on it or build an earthbag home - somewhere along those lines. The only real concern I have is electricity to do the editing work but I figure if I do the work I need to do head to a McDonalds/park/etc to recharge then I can do alright. I'll be able to store the DJ gear for when its not being used for free. I have a battery charger/car jumper combo I'm keeping in my car I can use for small electronics and I'm pretty sure I'll have friends who I can see for a couple hours to charge that once a week and see friends I haven't in years (which obviously is the best part!),Normal

He has been prescribed a myriad of medications to try and combat the dreams but not much has helped. It will work for a week to a few weeks but the dreams manifest no matter what. He had been seeing a cognitive therapist but she was not helping much. I personally believe that he needs someone who can get a bit deeper and work on the root of the problems and that the dreams are his subconscious’ way of screaming for help.,Normal
28746,It's unfortunate we can't crosspost links from other subs like r/psychology to r/ptsd because sometimes a useful article comes along that might really help. TL;DR - This study suggests for whatever reason some people who experience trauma learn to associate signifiers of the event with less invasive memories which helps them be less affected by it. And that it could potentially be applied in CBT therapy. It doesn't say how as of yet. Disclaimer: I have not read [the <url> itself just the article.,Normal

28756,So the now: we had been commiserating for a while about our shitty exes and stress and about 3 weeks ago I was on a date and realized I would have rather just spent the night with her instead of the date. A couple days later while having some drinks and de-stressing I kissed her. She kissed me back. We stopped before having sex and ended up meeting a couple days later where we both agreed to take things slow in light of our most recent breakups. We ended up spending the next few nights together as she didn't want to be home around her ex and we just cuddled and would kiss but then stop before we had sex.,Normal
28757,When I was eighteen I lived with my father as adult roomates I found him four years later at 22 when he died of a heroin overdose. He was bereft at the fact that he had done wrong by us kids during those years. He had striven to be better than his father who was a overtly cruel man who abandoned the family when he was 11. It is so hard for me to think he knew any better. The only way he could have done right by us would have been to give us kids up.,Normal

We came in when you were in bed last night and uncle _______ held you for a bit” and I remember being super confused because I didn’t remember that and also why would they come in and hold me when I was asleep? Anyway that memory was weird.,Normal

28775,When I'm single it's never an issue if a person I'm seeing is sleeping with others but as soon as I fall in love I can get kind of possessive. My partner is very much the opposite.

28783,I could really use additional input on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point. When we try to go out and do things we often do not have fun because our personalities clash.

I don't want to get into every story and man do I have some stories but i guess it's important to know that I've been warned about their general attitude and behavior from others and everyone who has met them that I'm friends or family with has agreed with me that their son is the source of their happiness and they feed off of each others negativity.

Someone else in club told me before that my friend felt threatened by me intellectually and inferred that he might resent me for it.

28881,That night wasn’t so great for me as I felt ignored because both of the guys (my bf and the mutual friend) were mostly having conversations with her leaving me to trail behind. I thought maybe it’s because we were “hosting” her and because she’s on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to us - as in she’s into things and engages in those things we’re not necessarily into but are interested in and could hold a conversation about. Anyway over the course of our relationship my bf would still bring Sally up occasionally how they were going to hang out with other coworkers. Of course I’m totally okay with that and I encourage him to be social when he can! I’ve met all of his friends and I always enjoy myself around them - except you know who enter Sally *rolls eyes*.,Normal

That was that. She told the guy she was in a relationship (who doesn't check relationship status on Facebook ffs? ) and thanked him for creating a shitstorm.,Normal

Up til recently I refused to even entertain the idea because she is slightly over a full decade younger than me. My sister thinks I'm being stupid letting the age difference make my mind up for me to the point where we had a huge fight at Christmas about it but I refused to budge.

She dated that ex for two years but never seemed that interested in him. She would complain about feeling like a caregiver for him (he was seriously depressed to the point where she had to make doctor appointments for him) and always talked about wanting to be with someone who was more independent and had their life together. As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).",Normal

29036,It's important to put your needs first sometimes. This might sound really obvious but I never realized just how harmful it can be to try and please everyone all the time. Whether you speak your mind or don't there's always going to be someone who dislikes you. I think it's important to realize that there's VALUE in your personal expression so it's worth the risk of offending a few people. I just haven't been able to see the value in my own words for so long.,Normal
29037,I've been dating this guy for nearly three months. We met at a bar and had a one night stand so my expectations were very low. We started by taking it slow (dinner or takeout and a movie on Saturdays) but things felt really nice and normal. I'm used to meeting guys on apps where everything is a game and usually they are dating multiple people at once; this felt different. We met before Thanksgiving and managed to keep the momentum going through a lot of travel and three weeks spent apart.,Normal

I get along really well with some people in this agreed group and they are far more enthusiastic and keen than the others I mentioned above.

Since that happened I agreed to live take the slot with them. Having a house with them (five of us total) and I think it's in my best interest as they are a tight friend group meaning communication to sort it out is easier and they're more assertive - four of them are also taking the same subject as me.,Normal

29139,Even present-day situations where they are receiving love from a safe person can trigger the awareness and subsequent grief of knowing how unloved they were by comparison. Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders and even fewer hours on helping their survivors. Many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) or bipolar disorder.,Normal

I've really enjoyed everything about our relationship as she's taught me more than anyone ever has and has been the best at putting up with any and all things that have come up. About halfway through the first year she began asking if I'd ever be okay with her experimenting with a girl or if I'd ever consider her having other sex friends.

About 5 years ago I started feeling small signs of PTSD but just brushed it off like it wasn’t a real thing until it just kept getting worse and eating away at me until I realized enough is enough.

He would spend hours talking to me about lessons on morality his suffering at the hands of my insensitive/clueless mom and his love of all things romantic and sensual. Mixed in here there was some kind of pervy behavior.,Normal
29198,I have had SAD for about five years and in those times I tried so many things to ease the anxiety. You know like medication therapy desensitising etc. None of those seemed to do me any good. However for the past year I have been working out nearly everyday and my anxiety has been alleviated A LOT. I can't exaggerate it it just really chills me out.,Normal
29199,Until just a bit before I decide to move to that other city I've been thinking about moving to I guess. Actually I was told that it's cleared by cops every month and I remember a flashlight being shined on me last month when I was too stoned to completely wake up (at least not so slowly) or to see whether it was a cop. Maybe it's the right kind of cop and I look the the kind of person they don't feel any need to bother for being here. This is more of an /r/randomthoughts post for me but I'm putting it here because it's relevant.,Normal
29200,She's been attack free for months now. There seems to be a downside to this though our relationship is taking a turn for the worst. The doctor said one of the side effects would be a loss of sex drive which I understood and was ok with as long as it helped her. Lately though she's been just colder to me. We had a talk the other day and she says she still loves me but more as a friend.,Normal

29202,### Unforeseen Consequences and Social Blind Spots I did think of [my abuser's first name] as a stranger. I was a naive 14-year-old kid that saw him as a potential new friend. Only in recent years have I realised how he coerced me into trusting him enough so I would visit him. I’m certainly not proud of making myself vulnerable in this way but why am I even considering how I might have contributed to my own sexual abuse?,Normal
29205,"She keeps using the phrase ""right now"". Whenever I ask her about us she says ""right now no but in the future who knows?"" I decided to put no contact measures into place as I could not give her what she wants while staying in contact with her. As much as it pained me to stop talking to her I know that I need to do this for her as well as for myself. When this happened she was bawling over the phone but she never questioned it.",Normal
29206,I’d decided to include them because they can either be used or not but would be interested to hear people's thoughts. I’ll be going out this weekend to pass them out there are unfortunately quite a few people sleeping on our high street so I had planned to give them to the first four people I came across. I assume it would be best to just say “Hi” and explain what’s in the bag and take it from there? I imagine people on the streets get a lot of abuse so I’m a bit worried about approaching someone in case they think I’m a twat. Also if someone is asleep I assume it would be best to just leave a bag for them rather than wake them up to see if they wanted it?,Normal

29222,She never disclosed any of this to me and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first. In her words she was afraid I would lose all interest in her if I found out she was married before. Truth be told I likely would have as I was still young when we first met. She claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives ((still lived with his parents)).

29237,This was literally the first meal I've had with other people in nearly a year. This couple was young enough to be my children and I could picture myself in their situation which I pray will never happen but if it does I would really hope someone would buy me some food every once in a while. The guy seemed a bit sheepish but the woman seemed a bit more comfortable with being homeless. They seemed like decent enough people and I don't regret buying them food but towards the end of our meal the woman said something to the guy about getting home by midnight. But I thought they were homeless!?!,Normal
29238, am a married 26 yo father of one. About two years ago I left my job to start a business with a childhood friend of mine and his brother. It ended horribly with them taking out the funds for the company from a joint account and leaving me penniless. As a result I moved with my family into my mother's home to get back on my feet. My relationship with her has never been good but it was the only option at the time so I ground my teeth and did the best to make it work.,Normal

29242,He didn't talk to me for a few days and told me he needed some space. He ended up talking to her and it worked out because she actually got a raise in the city that we're both from and her manager begged her to stay and work there. He decided he didn't want to be mad and brought me coffee this morning and talked about it with me. I told him that he could date this girl when we broke up and I couldn't control that but I don't like them living together so soon after we break up.

29245,She went through a very rough patch about a year ago and her mental health was clearly affected she was living out of her car she had left an abusive bf and then she had a crash in her car. For some reason she decided to go to Romania for treatment. I only heard from her sporadically. Once she called me and let slip that she had been raped as well as hit drugged something about a court case and whay sounded to me like a lot of paranoia about mafia and government. I put this down to ptsd from her abuse.,Normal
29248,It was a bit cringe because she was acting just too over the top. But I did give her the benefit of the doubt because that could have just been her character. However the things she were saying were very icky for my liking and I was uncomfortable about 10 minutes in. It’s very vague in my mind as it was a while ago but what I remember was that She said “ I hope you dont mind Harry cuddling me when I’m poorly and when we Netflix and chill” and “what are WE doing Friday?” (Me and Harry arranged a date night as we were both off work and college on this day. ) I remember looking at harry and kind of giving him a confused WTF look.,Normal

I am developing a storytelling and mental health platform with the ultimate aim of curating a museum exhibition. Soul relics Museum is a platform for people to read and tell stories of mental health through objects that help them connect or express to a present or past experience they have had with their mental health. It’s a unique and creative idea to help people come forward and share with others what mental health problems have been like for them and a safe and constructive way to read of others experiences while being brave enough to share your own.

The typical “I can fix this” response that colours victims of abusive partners - and having been one it is especially demoralizing to see him having to go through this for the sake of avoiding both change and a failed marriage. What can I do to help him besides support him emotionally and eventually have him realize for himself that this is not normal? tl;dr: my [25F] partner [30M] is being abused by his wife [28F] but is convinced to keep trying to make it work despite the situation detrimentally affecting his own mental health.,Normal

29275,My husband and I live in an apartment that gets super cold easily. Part of that is because there's no protective trees in the winter with the other problem being the buildings are run down and there's lots of cracks around the door. My husband was able to fix a gaping crack with our door frame but we still need more work done and management is not the best. Our heaters are old baseboard heaters that can heat the home but run up our electricity bill like crazy.

For some background I recognize that I tend to overreact to normal things I have panic attacks when people innocently flirt with me for example and I’ve flown off the handle when too many men have even just looked at me in too short of a space of time. Anyway so we were roommates in a super tiny apartment that didn’t even have a living room just our two bedrooms divided by a kitchen. He was having some issues with his ex-girlfriend so he was venting to me for hours about it and I was trying to give him as much advice as I could because he’s my friend and I care about him. I told him this and he said he cares about me too and then he started telling me that when he first met me he was attracted to me but that I was too young so he felt weird.,Normal
29317,I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on. Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous my heart beats really fast my limbs feel like jelly heavy breathing I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person! I'm seeing someone about these problems but I just thought I'd ask if anyone has any extra advice they could give if things start to get a bit out of control.,Normal
29319,She was really worried about being retraumatized by her birth. At the time I didn’t understand trauma or realize how deep her problems were (since I hadn’t seen them much) but I always listened to her first and foremost. We paid out of pocket for a home birth with a backup hospital plan at her parents’ house. The birth was precipitous (very fast only a few hours) and extremely traumatic and painful. No pain medication and I think the speed of the birth makes it more traumatic and our son had his hand over his head when he came out.,Normal

We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time and about your quality of life.

I know having a back up plan doesn't sound romantic but both he and I have discussed all of the above and both of us are long term planners who place 'back-up' plans in place in case anything goes awry. I have always been in relationships where I was still able to be an independent unit and avoid too much commitment because I was always scared to lose my independence. But this is the first relationship where I feel like we're a really good fit and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice I don't want to make. I will still be doing a lot of things on my own he is also an independent person and both of us have lived on our own for years and know we can take care of ourselves.,Normal

29954,"I never personally did anything beyond a ""show me yours and I'll show you mine"" type of thing where another kid and I would see how we ""measured up"" but it felt like those experiences had heavily sexual undertones for me - I don't know if that was me figuring things out or if my mind went there from what happened to me cousin. When I was about 13 I remember thinking to myself that it was crazy that so many of my peers knew what they wanted - I was just really really confused. I said to myself ""I don't know what I like or which team I go and I bet that's because of what happened between me and my cousin. I'll figure it out when I'm older"" and that was it. I did what a lot of other kids my age were doing - I hopped online and watched lots of porn.",Normal
29955,I would comfort her as much as I was able and once when I was home on break I even confronted my brother about his behavior. I tried to be empathetic and not accusatory and have a conversation about his feelings and encourage self-reflection. I talked about how I suffered from depression in graduate school and compared my symptoms of increased irritability and desire to stay at home with his current behavior. He seemed receptive to the conversation instead of becoming defensive as he usually does and ultimately I suggested he try counseling as that helped me. He never pursued it though.,Normal

29969,How do I decide? I clicked with one guy but he does talk therapy doesn't really have a specific method like EMDR or CBT. There are many who use specific methods and most didn't click or had approaches I feel iffy about.

Fortunately the police were able to put together what actually happened based on my blood trail. Thank God I was sitting when she hit me and that the blood all around me proved it otherwise I would be in jail for something I didn't do.

30002,Hello You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time and about your quality of life.,Normal

TL DR: Father passed away my mother can´t pay the rent and bills etc. Now I ask for advice for jobs and ways to increase my income so I can help my mother pay the rents,Normal
30008,One of them was “Catchphrase”. Similar to Taboo but you pass around a device and have to get your team to guess the word/phrase before the timer runs out. Of course it has to make a countdown noise/beeping which makes me even more anxious. My partner has gotten quite good at gauging where I am on a scale of 1-10. He noticed that I was getting more tense as it was passed around the circle headed towards me.,Normal
30011,They can’t all be wrong or insane can they? Abusers spend so long abusing and being nice and abusing and being nice that you start to think that you play a role in the abuse and the only reason he/she is nice to you again is because of some demand you met. And your will to live/be safe/feel secure will override any trauma you have been through. You will do anything to make them nice again because that means you get to be safe/secure. It's not contingent upon you but on them but you forget this.,Normal

Now I know you guys may ask why did you continue to allow the abuse with you if you had stopped it with your mother before? Well I have an answer to that my mother loved my father very much and every time I tried contacting the police she would stop me and I have a lot of love towards my mother and would do anything for her... but anyways back to the present we no longer live with him anymore and we have cut all ties with him except for my brother.,Normal

30120,I started talking to a girl 'J' on Tinder about a month ago. She's funny attractive and quick-witted however she was apprehensive to meet up for a drink to get to know each other in person straight away. We are both from the same town (we matched over Christmas) however she lives an hour and a half away in a much larger city. She first claimed that she could not afford to travel to see me even when she was back in my town (she also refused to let me pay for anything involving her including travel to her city to meet her) however said last week that she did not want to meet me until she knew that I was genuine about her and wanted to talk on the phone every evening for a week. If I did this then she would meet me on the day afterwards.,Normal

I've heard handfuls of people say music helps but that's never been that case for me. Until tonight.

30135,Leaving was one of the hardest things I had ever had to do. My parents really disagreed with me taking time off from school so as fall came they spent every day trying to get me to go see if I could come back in the spring and to get a job. Now job has always been a scary word for me because my only job I've had is teaching people how to hit things beautifully (Percussion Private Lessons).

30171,BACKGROUND: paul and i met 1.5 years ago on okcupid and hit it off right away. at the time we were both in long-term open relationships with other people so we fell into a pretty quick routine that involved seeing each other once a week for a meal or drinks and sex [the best of his life allegedly]. About 6 months into it/the December before last he and his partner of 8 years broke up which sent him into a bit of a depression/naturally intense period of introspection. Independently/for unrelated reasons my own longterm relationship also came to an end. Paul and I saw each other less but kept in touch.,Normal

The guy reciprocates by immediately pushing her multiple times and they were NOT soft pushes and seems like he was trying to push her to the ground. Couple pushes in I was in shock by the fact that you could really be in a relationship with someone that is abusive or that physically hurts you or maybe it was that moment she found out who he really was. She got up immediately and walked the opposite direction walking back towards me and I try not to look at her but she was just devastated I can tell.,Normal

We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment. We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder – you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires. The questionnaires will only take about 10 minutes to complete online. For your participation we’ll donate £1 on your behalf to a mental health charity (Young Minds: Child & Adolescent Mental Health Mental Health Foundation or Rethink).,Normal

31695,are you going to be buried next to each other?,Normal
31696,oh no. our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.,Normal
31697,you're not going to be buried?,Normal
31698,a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.,Normal
31699,yes but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.,Normal
31700,children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.,Normal
31701,that's true. a cemetery is for dead people not living people.,Normal
31702,did you wipe your feet? ,Normal

32468,that sounds like a nice date.,Normal
32469,yes it was pleasant.,Normal
32470,but you won't date him again?,Normal
32471,i had the worst date the other night.,Normal
32472,what happened?,Normal
32473,first of all he was half an hour late.,Normal
32474,that's not a good start.,Normal
32475,then he didn't bother to apologize.,Normal
32476,that's rude.,Normal
32477,then he drove too fast to the restaurant.,Normal
32478,that's dangerous.,Normal
32479,i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.,Normal
32480,what happened at the restaurant?,Normal
32481,we had a $40 meal and he left a $1 tip!,Normal
32482,i don't like that man.,Normal
32483,why not?,Normal
32484,he's a dirty old man.,Normal
32485,what do you mean?,Normal
32486,he's old enough to be my father yet he asked me out.,Normal
32487,well you can't blame a man for asking.,Normal
32488,he should act his age.,Normal
32489,but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.,Normal
32490,they should find a nice hobby.,Normal
32491,just wait until you're 50 years old.,Normal
32492,dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.,Normal
32493,does your girlfriend ever make you angry?,Normal
32494,sometimes.,Normal
32495,what does she do?,Normal
32496,just yesterday i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.,Normal
32497,that was a nice thing to say.,Normal
32498,that's what i thought.,Normal
32499,what did she say?,Normal
32500,she laughed! she didn't believe me.,Normal
32501,that wasn't very nice of her.,Normal
32502,she said that nothing is more important to me than money.,Normal
32503,what did you say?,Normal
32504,some people have good noses.,Normal
32505,i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.,Normal
32506,i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.,Normal
32507,oh. but that can be a curse.,Normal
32508,yes because you can be too sensitive to odors.,Normal
32509,i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.,Normal
32510,did she catch you using drugs?,Normal
32511,sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.,Normal
32512,you don't need a good nose for thatÂ—cigarettes stink.,Normal
32513,but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning she can smell it that evening!,Normal
32514,boy that is a good nose.,Normal
32515,let's go out to eat.,Normal
32516,that sounds like fun.,Normal
32517,where do you want to go?,Normal
32518,let me think a minute.,Normal
32519,i feel like chinese.,Normal
32520,that sounds delicious.,Normal
32521,i know a good chinese restaurant.,Normal
32522,how far away is it?,Normal
32523,it's only 10 minutes from here.,Normal
32524,do we need reservations?,Normal
32525,oh no. we can walk right in.,Normal
32526,i can't believe how long this line is.,Normal
32527,this is a popular restaurant isn't it?,Normal
32528,yes but it isn't a fast-food restaurant is it?,Normal
32529,it's the slowest hamburger in town.,Normal
32530,that's because they cook it while you wait.,Normal
32531,yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.,Normal
32532,a great burger and great service.,Normal
32533,yes the workers are very polite.,Normal
32534,and they're clean.,Normal
32535,i've been coming here for years.,Normal
32536,me too.,Normal
32537,lunch was delicious.,Normal
32538,thank you.,Normal
32539,what kind of soup was that?,Normal
32540,it was tomato soup.,Normal
32541,that tasted so good.,Normal
32542,i put lemon and butter in it.,Normal
32543,the sandwich was good too.,Normal
32544,everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.,Normal
32545,especially on toast.,Normal
32546,and the pickles were great too.,Normal
32547,tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.,Normal
32548,i'm calling the waiter.,Normal
32549,what's the matter?,Normal
32550,this steak has too much fat.,Normal
32551,what do you want the waiter to do?,Normal
32552,bring me a better steak.,Normal
32553,i wouldn't do that.,Normal
32554,why not?,Normal
32555,they will drop the new steak on the floor step on it and then spit on it.,Normal
32556,you're crazy.,Normal
32557,then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.,Normal
32558,where do you get these crazy ideas?,Normal
32559,let's leave.,Normal
32560,but we just got here.,Normal
32561,did you see the waiter's hands?,Normal
32562,no.,Normal
32563,he had dirty fingernails.,Normal
32564,really?,Normal
32565,his nails were black!,Normal
32566,that's disgusting.,Normal
32567,and he poured water into our glasses.,Normal
32568,yuck! no water for me.,Normal
32569,i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty too.,Normal
32570,this hot bread is delicious.,Normal
32571,i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.,Normal
32572,well i think we are paying for it.,Normal
32573,no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.,Normal
32574,it is delicious especially with butter.,Normal
32575,i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.,Normal
32576,they probably wouldn't like that.,Normal
32577,i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.,Normal
32578,then stop eating the bread!,Normal
32579,okay just one more piece. pass the butter please.,Normal
32580,if i owned a restaurant i would never serve hot bread before the main course.,Normal
32581,is this a clean restaurant?,Normal
32582,well the tables and chairs look okay.,Normal
32583,okay let's sit down.,Normal
32584,check out the silverware.,Normal
32585,it passes inspection.,Normal
32586,here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.,Normal
32587,well the waiter looked clean so i guess it's okay to eat here.,Normal
32588,you're forgetting about the bathroom.,Normal
32589,i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.,Normal
32590,you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?,Normal
32591,no i'd rather not find out that it's dirty because i'm pretty hungry right now.,Normal
32592,have you seen our waiter?,Normal
32593,here he comes now.,Normal
32594,we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.,Normal
32595,oops i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter.,Normal
32596,we can give him five more minutes and then leave.,Normal
32597,i'll go up front and talk to the manager.,Normal
32598,that's a good idea.,Normal
32599,maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.,Normal
32600,maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.,Normal
32601,every time we eat out it's an adventure.,Normal
32602,last time we got seats next to the kitchen.,Normal
32603,is this table okay?,Normal
32604,no it's too close to the kitchen door.,Normal
32605,how about this table?,Normal
32606,no it's too close to the front door.,Normal
32607,this looks like a nice table.,Normal
32608,no it's too close to the salad bar.,Normal
32609,okay i give up.,Normal
32610,well there is one good table.,Normal
32611,great. which one?,Normal
32612,i don't believe the art world.,Normal
32613,what is it this time?,Normal
32614,an andy warhol drawing.,Normal
32615,he's a famous artist.,Normal
32616,he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.,Normal
32617,did he sign it?,Normal
32618,yes.,Normal
32619,is it beautiful?,Normal
32620,it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!,Normal
32621,so it's not worth much?,Normal
32622,only about $30000.,Normal
32623,can we go to the baseball game?,Normal
32624,of course.,Normal
32625,i love baseball.,Normal
32626,so do i.,Normal
32627,i love to eat the peanuts.,Normal
32628,i love to eat the hot dogs.,Normal
32629,i hope we'll see a home run.,Normal
32630,i hope we'll catch a foul ball.,Normal
32631,bring a jacket.,Normal
32632,yes. it gets a little cool at night.,Normal
32633,bring a glove to catch a foul ball.,Normal
32634,golf is a silly game.,Normal
32635,it certainly is.,Normal
32636,you hit a white ball.,Normal
32637,and then you chase it.,Normal
32638,and then you hit it again.,Normal
32639,finally you put the ball into a hole in the ground.,Normal
32640,you do this 18 times because there are 18 holes.,Normal
32641,what's the point?,Normal
32642,how can it be fun?,Normal
32643,they pay money to play this silly game!,Normal
32644,i think golfers have a mental problem.,Normal
32645,do you want to go fishing?,Normal
32646,yes. that's a good idea.,Normal
32647,where do you want to go?,Normal
32648,we can go to the river.,Normal
32649,or we can go to the lake.,Normal
32650,or we can go to the ocean.,Normal
32651,let's go to the lake.,Normal
32652,yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.,Normal
32653,we can be there in 20 minutes.,Normal
32654,i'll get our fishing rods.,Normal
32655,i'll get the bait.,Normal
32656,baseball is fun.,Normal
32657,i like to hit the ball.,Normal
32658,i like to run around the bases.,Normal
32659,i like to slide into the bases.,Normal
32660,yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.,Normal
32661,i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.,Normal
32662,me too. i want to play for the yankees.,Normal

32665,i don't like practice.,Normal
32666,me neither. it's boring.,Normal
32667,let's go jogging.,Normal
32668,that's a good idea.,Normal
32669,i bought some new shoes.,Normal
32670,are they comfortable?,Normal
32671,they're very comfortable.,Normal
32672,how much were they?,Normal
32673,they were on sale for $80.,Normal
32674,do they help you run faster?,Normal
32675,no but my feet don't hurt anymore.,Normal
32676,then they're worth every penny.,Normal
32677,you might want to buy a pair.,Normal
32678,tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.,Normal
32679,you can say that again.,Normal
32680,but i'm worried about tiger.,Normal
32681,why is that?,Normal
32682,because he likes to scuba dive.,Normal
32683,what's wrong with that?,Normal
32684,it can be dangerous.,Normal
32685,you mean he could drown.,Normal
32686,he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.,Normal
32687,but he dives to relax.,Normal
32688,he might relax but it makes me nervous.,Normal
32689,did you watch that golf tournament?,Normal
32690,the one that tiger won?,Normal
32691,how did he do it?,Normal
32692,it was nothing for him.,Normal
32693,he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!,Normal
32694,he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.,Normal
32695,i think he is from outer space.,Normal
32696,no human could possibly play golf that well.,Normal
32697,whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament he makes that shot.,Normal
32698,no human can do that.,Normal
32699,somebody should check his birth record.,Normal
32700,who's the greatest baseball player?,Normal
32701,there are so many great players.,Normal
32702,yes but who is the greatest?,Normal
32703,i'd have to say babe ruth.,Normal
32704,most people would say that.,Normal
32705,he changed the game.,Normal
32706,yes he made the home run popular.,Normal
32707,everybody loved him all over the nation.,Normal
32708,he helped make the yankees the best team ever.,Normal
32709,and ruth was a good person too.,Normal
32710,he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.,Normal
32711,did you hear what happened at the baseball game?,Normal
32712,no please tell me.,Normal
32713,someone punched out someone.,Normal
32714,that's not nice.,Normal
32715,it's worse than that.,Normal
32716,how so?,Normal
32717,two guys got into an argument.,Normal
32718,i'll bet they were drinking.,Normal
32719,a third guy punched one of the two guys.,Normal
32720,i'll bet he was drinking too.,Normal
32721,the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.,Normal
32722,i want to go to the ball game.,Normal
32723,is there a game tonight?,Normal
32724,yes it starts at 7 p.m.,Normal
32725,can we get tickets?,Normal
32726,yes but only the cheap tickets.,Normal
32727,how much are they?,Normal
32728,they're only $5 each.,Normal
32729,that's a good price.,Normal
32730,yes it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.,Normal
32731,where are the seats?,Normal
32732,they're behind the outfield.,Normal
32733,golf is so hard.,Normal
32734,what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?,Normal
32735,it's hard if you want to do it right.,Normal
32736,you mean like tiger?,Normal
32737,no like a good amateur golfer.,Normal
32738,what's so hard about golf?,Normal
32739,there are so many things you have to do right.,Normal
32740,like what?,Normal
32741,like keep your left arm straight keep your head down and follow through.,Normal
32742,yikes! who can remember all that?,Normal
32743,you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.,Normal
32744,did you hear about the ball player?,Normal
32745,the home run hitter on drugs?,Normal
32746,he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.,Normal
32747,he said he wasn't using drugs.,Normal
32748,he apologized to the fans.,Normal
32749,the league suspended him for 50 games.,Normal
32750,that will cost him some money.,Normal
32751,yes about $7 million.,Normal
32752,that will teach him a good lesson.,Normal
32753,he probably won't use drugs anymore.,Normal
32754,but it won't stop other players from using drugs.,Normal
32755,why is there so much crime?,Normal
32756,because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.,Normal
32757,is that it?,Normal
32758,also there aren't enough police.,Normal
32759,but there are a lot of police.,Normal
32760,there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.,Normal
32761,can't we hire more police?,Normal
32762,no. it costs too much money.,Normal
32763,doesn't crime cost more than police?,Normal
32764,yes it does.,Normal
32765,so it would be cheaper to hire more police?,Normal
32766,this is a great neighborhood.,Normal
32767,yes it is.,Normal
32768,people are friendly.,Normal
32769,yes they are.,Normal
32770,the streets and sidewalks are clean.,Normal
32771,yes they are.,Normal
32772,there's a real nice park nearby.,Normal
32773,yes there is.,Normal
32774,i feel safe here.,Normal
32775,there is no crime here.,Normal
32776,i wish i could move here.,Normal
32777,the house burned down.,Normal
32778,what happened?,Normal
32779,the man fell asleep.,Normal
32780,was he smoking?,Normal
32781,yes he was smoking a cigarette.,Normal
32782,did he die?,Normal
32783,yes he did. his cat died too.,Normal
32784,that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?,Normal
32785,the battery was dead.,Normal
32786,a good battery would have saved his life.,Normal
32787,he had cigarettes but no battery.,Normal
32788,they say he has started fifteen big fires.,Normal
32789,he's been in jail three times already.,Normal
32790,why did they ever let him out?,Normal
32791,it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.,Normal
32792,why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.,Normal
32793,i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.,Normal
32794,but his latest fire killed someone.,Normal
32795,this time they have charged him with murder.,Normal
32796,so maybe he'll go to jail forever?,Normal
32797,i sure hope so.,Normal
32798,someone should set him on fire.,Normal
32799,put your seatbelt on.,Normal
32800,why?,Normal
32801,because it will protect you in case of an accident.,Normal
32802,but it's uncomfortable.,Normal
32803,it's the law.,Normal
32804,it's so much trouble.,Normal
32805,it's common sense.,Normal
32806,it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.,Normal
32807,hold your breath till we get there.,Normal
32808,okay my seatbelt is on.,Normal
32809,i'm glad you don't complain very much.,Normal
32810,what are you doing?,Normal

32818,what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?,Normal
32819,i never thought about that.,Normal
32820,you'd be blind for the rest of your life!,Normal
32821,did you see that puddle of water on the floor?,Normal
32822,yes. i called for a clean-up.,Normal
32823,a puddle of water is very dangerous.,Normal
32824,it isn't easy to see.,Normal
32825,but it's real easy to slip on.,Normal
32826,especially on these slick floors.,Normal
32827,someone who slips could hurt their back.,Normal
32828,they could even crack their head open.,Normal
32829,we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.,Normal
32830,we can leave if we put an orange cone here.,Normal
32831,yes but i don't know where the orange cones are.,Normal

32858,they want to get guns off the street.,Normal
32859,who would turn in a gun for $200?,Normal

32873,then why does everyone lock their doors?,Normal
32874,i guess they haven't read this article.,Normal
32875,no one believes that the crime rate is going down.,Normal
32876,people who live in california are crazy.,Normal
32877,why is that?,Normal
32878,because of all the earthquakes and fires.,Normal
32879,but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.,Normal
32880,once in a while is once too many.,Normal
32881,but you're right. there are a lot of fires.,Normal
32882,a recent fire destroyed 85 homes.,Normal

32925,that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.,Normal
32926,well it's an hour to get there if there are no traffic problems.,Normal
32927,so maybe we better leave at 8:15?,Normal
32928,yes it's better to get there too early than too late.,Normal
32929,i agree.,Normal
32930,you never know what might happen on these freeways.,Normal
32931,i need to fly to new york.,Normal

32956,did he set a new record?,Normal
32957,yes i think he did.,Normal
32958,well i guess that's why he did it.,Normal
32959,what's the point?,Normal

33194,i want to be a mail carrier when i grow up.,Normal

33197,you sure do.,Normal
33198,and you get a lot of exercise every day.,Normal
33199,that's the truth.,Normal
33200,and you get to play with a lot of dogs.,Normal
33201,well you're supposed to be working.,Normal
33202,yes but i will always pet the friendly dogs.,Normal
33203,what about the unfriendly dogs?,Normal

33206,to the state or the city?,Normal
33207,to the city of course.,Normal

33249,i'm on a new diet.,Normal
33250,what are you eating now?,Normal
33251,i switched from pasta to potatoes.,Normal
33252,why did you do that?,Normal
33253,pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.,Normal

33255,and it's just as easy to prepare.,Normal
33256,how do you prepare the potatoes?,Normal
33257,i wash them and then steam them for 15 minutes.,Normal

33260,my girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.,Normal
33261,why was that?,Normal
33262,i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.,Normal
33263,what's the matter with that?,Normal
33264,her mom is a great cook.,Normal
33265,so a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.,Normal
33266,it hurt her feelings.,Normal
33267,oh.,Normal
33268,i apologized to her but i could tell she was still upset.,Normal
33269,maybe you shouldn't eat there again.,Normal
33270,i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.,Normal
33271,i eat the same thing every day.,Normal
33272,you're kidding.,Normal
33273,no i'm serious.,Normal
33274,doesn't that get old?,Normal
33275,no because i'm eating food that i like.,Normal
33276,but the same thing day after day gets old.,Normal
33277,well i guess if it ever does get old i'll change to something different.,Normal
33278,do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?,Normal
33279,no i hate vegetables.,Normal
33280,but you eat fruits.,Normal

33298,i'll have to try them sometime.,Normal
33299,they're best when they're hot.,Normal
33300,my brother is allergic to peanuts.,Normal
33301,that's not good.,Normal
33302,no it isn't. he almost died when he was little.,Normal
33303,i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.,Normal
33304,i'm gaining weight.,Normal
33305,how much have you gained?,Normal
33306,three pounds just this month.,Normal
33307,do you know why?,Normal
33308,i think it's the ice cream.,Normal

33310,it was on sale.,Normal
33311,how much did you buy?,Normal
33312,i filled up my freezer with ice cream.,Normal

33318,i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.,Normal
33319,i like my food hot and fresh.,Normal
33320,you like to see it disappear.,Normal
33321,i don't like it reheated.,Normal
33322,well you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.,Normal
33323,i'm so full i'm going to burst.,Normal
33324,you should loosen your belt.,Normal
33325,i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.,Normal
33326,i saw what you did.,Normal
33327,i didn't do anything.,Normal
33328,oh yes you did.,Normal

33330,you know what i'm talking about.,Normal
33331,i don't have any idea.,Normal

33351,i hope you kept the receipt.,Normal
33352,you think they won't fit?,Normal

33371,i thought you just bought a pair.,Normal
33372,i did.,Normal
33373,what's wrong with them so soon?,Normal
33374,the pants are fine but the pocket has a huge hole in it.,Normal
33375,you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.,Normal
33376,but that's what pockets are for.,Normal
33377,you should carry them in a purse.,Normal
33378,i'm a man and men don't carry purses!,Normal
33379,well you should buy pants with stronger pockets.,Normal
33380,i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.,Normal

33398,that's a good deal.,Normal
33399,and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.,Normal
33400,another good deal.,Normal
33401,but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.,Normal

33444,also i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.,Normal
33445,why did you do that?,Normal
33446,i mixed them together.,Normal
33447,i really like this house.,Normal
33448,can we afford it?,Normal
33449,they want 20 percent down.,Normal
33450,that's a lot of money.,Normal
33451,but the house is so nice.,Normal
33452,it's in a great neighborhood.,Normal
33453,it's close to the beach.,Normal
33454,it's close to the freeways.,Normal
33455,it's got a big yard.,Normal
33456,the kids love the house too.,Normal
33457,if we don't buy it someone else will.,Normal

33471,what's the matter with it?,Normal
33472,it's on the corner.,Normal
33473,so?,Normal
33474,that means it gets twice as much traffic.,Normal
33475,you're right.,Normal
33476,when you're inside you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.,Normal
33477,or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.,Normal
33478,or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.,Normal
33479,let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.,Normal
33480,i hate looking for an apartment.,Normal
33481,me too.,Normal
33482,we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.,Normal
33483,we'd better get ready to go.,Normal
33484,it's an upstairs unit.,Normal
33485,that's good because i don't want to live under people with loud feet.,Normal
33486,and it's a corner unit.,Normal
33487,that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.,Normal
33488,no pets are allowed.,Normal
33489,perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.,Normal
33490,and there are only six units in the whole building.,Normal

33496,yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.,Normal
33497,it shouldn't take him long to fix it.,Normal
33498,i don't even know why we need to fix it.,Normal
33499,in case we have visitors.,Normal
33500,but they can just knock on the door.,Normal
33501,actually i want him to look at our carpet too.,Normal
33502,do you like this house?,Normal
33503,yes it's beautiful.,Normal
33504,it's perfect for us and the kids.,Normal
33505,three bedrooms three bathrooms and a big back yard.,Normal
33506,and we can afford it!,Normal
33507,so are we going to buy it?,Normal
33508,i'm afraid not.,Normal
33509,it's too far from your job isn't it?,Normal
33510,i can't spend four hours on the road every day.,Normal
33511,by the time you get home you'll be too tired to even eat.,Normal
33512,i won't be able to play with the kids.,Normal
33513,boy it's chilly outside isn't it?,Normal
33514,it sure is.,Normal
33515,in fact it's chilly in the apartment too.,Normal
33516,let's turn on the heat.,Normal
33517,i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.,Normal
33518,it should be warmer in a few minutes.,Normal
33519,it's so nice to have a heated apartment.,Normal
33520,how did they survive in the old days?,Normal
33521,they had fireplaces.,Normal
33522,someone had to chop the wood.,Normal
33523,and carry it into the house.,Normal
33524,this is a nice neighborhood.,Normal
33525,the streets are clean and quiet.,Normal
33526,the neighbors don't party on the weekends.,Normal
33527,people take care of their lawns.,Normal
33528,no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.,Normal
33529,we never have to call the police about anything.,Normal
33530,our kids are completely safe.,Normal
33531,so why are we selling our house?,Normal
33532,they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.,Normal
33533,so we've got to sell before property values go down?,Normal
33534,yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.,Normal
33535,that was a huge fire in santa barbara.,Normal
33536,yes it was.,Normal
33537,they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.,Normal
33538,and they were expensive houses.,Normal
33539,i feel so sorry for those people.,Normal
33540,why feel sorry for rich people?,Normal
33541,i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.,Normal
33542,so do i but not if they're rich.,Normal
33543,what does that have to do with it?,Normal
33544,rich people think they're better than us.,Normal
33545,how many rich people do you know?,Normal
33546,bears are invading our neighborhoods.,Normal
33547,of course they are. they're starving to death.,Normal
33548,they should stay in the woods where they belong.,Normal
33549,there's no food in the woods.,Normal
33550,can't they eat grass?,Normal
33551,do you think a bear is a cow?,Normal
33552,well i've seen them eating berries.,Normal
33553,berries aren't in season all year round.,Normal
33554,it's too dangerous for kids and pets.,Normal
33555,people need to cover their trash cans.,Normal
33556,the police need to shoot all the bears.,Normal
33557,who did you vote for?,Normal
33558,i voted for obama.,Normal
33559,me too.,Normal
33560,he will be a great president.,Normal
33561,everyone likes him.,Normal
33562,he's a good speaker.,Normal
33563,and he's really smart.,Normal
33564,he will solve our problems.,Normal
33565,he will end the war.,Normal
33566,the next four years will be good years.,Normal
33567,i'll vote for him next time too.,Normal
33568,the election is next week.,Normal
33569,who are you voting for?,Normal
33570,i'm not voting for the mayor.,Normal
33571,why not?,Normal
33572,he made promises that he didn't keep.,Normal
33573,like what?,Normal
33574,he promised to hire 1000 more police officers.,Normal
33575,how many did he hire?,Normal
33576,one hundred!,Normal
33577,maybe he had a good reason.,Normal
33578,maybe he's just a liar.,Normal
33579,i can't believe he won the election.,Normal
33580,only 15 percent of the voters turned out.,Normal
33581,that is a joke.,Normal
33582,voting is so important but people don't bother.,Normal
33583,many people think their vote doesn't matter.,Normal
33584,the mayor won by only 2000 votes.,Normal
33585,we're stuck with him for four more years.,Normal
33586,voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.,Normal
33587,all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.,Normal
33588,how easy is that?,Normal
33589,i guess people just don't care.,Normal
33590,well we have a new president.,Normal
33591,but we have the same old problems.,Normal
33592,well he's made a few changes.,Normal
33593,like what?,Normal
33594,i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.,Normal
33595,oh yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.,Normal
33596,who's paying for that?,Normal
33597,i think we are!,Normal
33598,well that's okay as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.,Normal
33599,yes we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.,Normal
33600,do any other world leaders have a basketball court?,Normal
33601,people say that everybody loves obama.,Normal
33602,well more than 50 million people voted for mccain.,Normal
33603,that's 50 million people who don't love obama.,Normal
33604,obama's got four years to make everyone happy.,Normal
33605,he's never going to make everyone happy.,Normal
33606,can you imagine being president?,Normal
33607,everyone wants you to solve their problems.,Normal
33608,i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.,Normal
33609,you and everybody else.,Normal
33610,i would never want to be president.,Normal
33611,but think about all the power you'd have.,Normal
33612,did you read this article?,Normal
33613,what article?,Normal
33614,it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.,Normal
33615,only 11 percent?,Normal
33616,about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.,Normal
33617,where does he travel to?,Normal
33618,oh all over the world.,Normal
33619,but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.,Normal
33620,he's visiting other cities to get ideas.,Normal
33621,can't he just go online?,Normal
33622,the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.,Normal
33623,who did you vote for for president?,Normal
33624,i voted for ralph nader.,Normal
33625,who in the world is ralph nader?,Normal
33626,he's the best man for president.,Normal
33627,why's that?,Normal
33628,he hates corporations.,Normal
33629,well most corporations do think only about money.,Normal
33630,he hates democrats and republicans.,Normal
33631,well they do put their party before their country.,Normal
33632,he's the only candidate that i trust.,Normal
33633,but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!,Normal
33634,i don't know why i bother to vote.,Normal
33635,why's that?,Normal
33636,what good does it do?,Normal
33637,you get to put someone in power that you like.,Normal
33638,only if my candidate wins.,Normal
33639,well he can't win unless you and others vote for him.,Normal
33640,but even if my candidate wins he'll break his promises.,Normal
33641,that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.,Normal
33642,and when elected they go their own way.,Normal
33643,they forget who put them in power.,Normal
33644,they forget where they came from.,Normal
33645,that election for u.s. senator stunk.,Normal
33646,what do you mean?,Normal
33647,there were more votes than voters!,Normal
33648,but that's impossible.,Normal
33649,officials said that it's possible.,Normal
33650,did they explain how it's possible?,Normal
33651,no. they said there are some things you can't explain.,Normal
33652,so are they going to hold another election?,Normal
33653,no. that will cost too much money.,Normal
33654,so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?,Normal
33655,well the democratic party says it was an honest election.,Normal
33656,i see that former president bush is at a conference.,Normal
33657,yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.,Normal
33658,yes those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.,Normal
33659,only 4000 american soldiers were killed overseas.,Normal
33660,not to mention 40000 wounded soldiers.,Normal
33661,but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.,Normal
33662,that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.,Normal
33663,he spoke to them and made them feel better.,Normal
33664,did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?,Normal
33665,no he didn't have time to do that.,Normal
33666,well he's got plenty of time now!,Normal
33667,did you get your official sample ballot?,Normal
33668,yes with the voter instructions.,Normal
33669,how are you going to vote?,Normal
33670,same as ever by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.,Normal
33671,i meant are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?,Normal
33672,against all of them of course.,Normal
33673,but we need new taxes to pay for highways schools and prisons.,Normal
33674,we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!,Normal
33675,that's true. where did that money go?,Normal
33676,our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.,Normal
33677,they are having a good time with our money.,Normal
33678,have you decided how you are going to vote?,Normal
33679,do you mean on measures 1 2 and 3?,Normal
33680,yes. the ones that will improve our schools roads and hospitals.,Normal
33681,you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.,Normal
33682,but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.,Normal
33683,do you believe the tv ads?,Normal
33684,i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.,Normal
33685,don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you the opposite is true.,Normal
33686,"but the title of measure 1 is ""better schools at no cost.""",Normal
33687,"the title should be ""better schools at huge cost.""",Normal
33688,i can't believe that they would lie to us.,Normal
33689,i have a stomachache.,Normal
33690,is it something you ate?,Normal
33691,maybe. i'm not sure.,Normal
33692,what did you have for breakfast?,Normal
33693,the usual cereal with milk and a banana.,Normal
33694,maybe the milk was bad.,Normal
33695,it didn't smell bad.,Normal
33696,maybe the banana was bad.,Normal
33697,no the banana was delicious.,Normal
33698,maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.,Normal
33699,no that's not the problem.,Normal
33700,what's this stain?,Normal
33701,i don't know.,Normal
33702,it looks like blood.,Normal
33703,i think my nose was bleeding.,Normal
33704,you should wet your shirt immediately.,Normal
33705,why?,Normal
33706,because that gets the blood out of the shirt.,Normal
33707,what's a little blood?,Normal
33708,your white shirt is ruined.,Normal
33709,so i'll just buy another one.,Normal
33710,you can wear this one around the house.,Normal
33711,my fingers hurt.,Normal
33712,why do they hurt?,Normal
33713,i type too much.,Normal
33714,you should take a break.,Normal
33715,i need to type to make money.,Normal
33716,but typing is causing you pain.,Normal
33717,maybe i should see a doctor.,Normal
33718,doctors are too expensive.,Normal
33719,he might tell me to rest for a while.,Normal
33720,he might want to cut you open.,Normal
33721,he might say i'm okay.,Normal
33722,what did the doctor say?,Normal
33723,he thinks i have too much stress.,Normal
33724,stress causes your stomachaches?,Normal
33725,stress causes different problems with different people.,Normal
33726,so what did he tell you to do?,Normal
33727,he said i need to think positive.,Normal
33728,he didn't give you any medication?,Normal
33729,i hate medication. it makes me feel different.,Normal
33730,so how do you think positive?,Normal
33731,i think about nice things.,Normal
33732,like what?,Normal

33738,paper cuts can hurt a lot.,Normal
33739,where are the band-aids?,Normal
33740,i think they're in the medicine cabinet.,Normal
33741,it's on the tip of my finger.,Normal
33742,a band-aid might not work.,Normal
33743,i must not use this finger until the cut heals.,Normal
33744,do you smell that?,Normal
33745,oh yes.,Normal
33746,i can't stand cigarette smoke.,Normal
33747,it smells so bad.,Normal
33748,one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.,Normal
33749,smokers think they are so cool.,Normal
33750,they are so weak.,Normal
33751,a little cigarette controls them.,Normal
33752,they look so stupid taking a puff.,Normal
33753,and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.,Normal
33754,they think it's cool.,Normal
33755,do you have a cold?,Normal
33756,yes i do.,Normal
33757,how did you get it?,Normal

33814,they brushed with their fingers.,Normal
33815,they also ate with their fingers!,Normal
33816,why do they call it the good old days?,Normal

33821,let's stop for a while. i need a break and some water.,Normal

33838,you might be right.,Normal
33839,do pimples run in your family?,Normal
33840,not that i've noticed.,Normal
